Where will God go to touch the world? Look deep within Mary for an answer.\nBetter still, look deep within yourself. What he did with Mary, he offers to us! He issues a Mary-level invitation to all his children. “If you’ll let me, I’ll move in!” What is the mystery of the gospel? “Christ in you, the hope of glory” (Colossians 1:27 NIV).\nChrist grew in Mary until he had to come out. Christ will grow in you until the same thing happens. He will come out in your speech, in your actions, in your decisions. Every place you live will be a Bethlehem, and every day you live will be a Christmas. You, like Mary, will deliver Christ into the world.',
