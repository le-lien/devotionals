I wish I could say that I never complain. I wish I could say that I never want what others have. I wish I could say that I have never envied the life of another. I wish I could say that I have never thought that God gave something to someone else that he meant for me. I wish I could say that I am better at counting my blessings than I am at assessing what I don’t have. I wish I could say that my appetite for things wasn’t so large. \n I wish my heart would finally be satisfied. These are all wishes because they are not yet completely true of me. Envy still lurks in my heart. It is one of the dark results of the sin that still resides there. \n Why does the Bible speak so strongly against envy? Here it is: when envy rules your heart, the love of God doesn’t. Let’s think about what envy does. It assumes that you deserve blessings that you don’t deserve. When your heart is ruled by envy, the attitude of “I am blessed” gets replaced with the attitude of “I deserve.” Envy is selfish to the core. Envy always puts you in the center of the world. It makes everything all about you. It causes you to examine life from the sole perspective of your wants, needs, and feelings.\nSadly, envy causes you to question the goodness, faithfulness, and wisdom of God. Envy accuses God of not knowing what he’s doing or of not being faithful to what he’s promised to do. When you are convinced that a blessing that another person has ought to belong to you, you don’t just have a problem with that person, you have a problem with God. When you begin to question God’s goodness, you quit going to him for help. Why? Because you don’t seek the help of someone you’ve come to doubt.\n Envy does something else that is spiritually deadly. It assumes understanding that no one has. Envy not only assumes that you know more about that other person’s life than you could ever know, it assumes that you have a clearer understanding of what is best than God does. Furthermore, envy causes you to forget God’s amazing rescuing, transforming, empowering, and delivering grace.\n You become so occupied with accounting for what you do not have that the enormous blessings of God’s grace—blessings that we could not have earned, achieved, or deserved—go unrecognized and uncelebrated. And because envy focuses more on what you want than it does on the life that God has called you to, it keeps you from paying attention to God’s commands and warnings, and therefore leaves you in moral danger. \nThe only solution to envy is God’s rescuing grace—grace that turns self-centered sinners into joyful and contented worshipers of God.',        "dailyPrayer": {          "title": "",          "text": ""        }      }                   ,"11-28": {        "title": '',        "note": '',        "passage": 'For further study and encouragement: <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/114/EPH.4.17-24?parallel=151">Ephesians 4:17–24</a>',        "dailyVerse": {          "ref": '',          "text": 'The person next to you doesn’t need the gospel more than you do; he just needs it differently than you do. All people sin and fall short.'        },        "body": 'The indictment of Romans 3 puts us all in the same boat: What then? Are we Jews any better off? No, not at all. For we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin, as it is written:\n“None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands;no one seeks for God.\nAll have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one.”\n“Their throat is an open grave; they use their tongues to deceive.” \n“The venom of asps is under their lips.”\n“Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness.”\n“Their feet are swift to shed blood; in their paths are ruin and misery, and the way of peace they have not known.”\n“There is no fear of God before their eyes.” (Rom. 3:9–18) Yes, we are all sinners. We are all in the same desperate condition. None of us is better off than any other. None of us is more righteous. None of us is more deserving. None of us has anything to point to that would commend us to God. We all need to be rescued from the dark rebellion of our own hearts. There is only one hope for us all—the amazing, forgiving, rescuing, transforming, and delivering grace of Jesus. The problem is that we often don’t see it that way.\nPart of the blindness of sin is our tendency to be more irritated by and more concerned about the sin of the people next to us than our own. Because we are blind to our own sin and our eyes are open to theirs, we tend to see our neighbors as bigger sinners than we are. And when you fall into comparing yourself to another person, you almost always conclude that you are more righteous than he is, and when you conclude that you are more righteous than he is, you begin to minimize you own need for grace. In this way, false spiritual comparisons put you in spiritual danger. They make you think that you’re better off than you are and weaken your resolve to seek and celebrate redeeming grace. We must cry out for grace to deliver us from this tendency.\nYes, we all stand before God deserving of his anger. How grateful we ought to be that Christ bore our penalty so that we could bask in God’s grace.',        "dailyPrayer": {          "title": '',          "text": ''        }} ,"11-29": {        "title": '',        "note": '',        "passage": 'For further study and encouragement: <a href= "https://www.bible.com/bible/114/ROM.8.NKJV?parallel=151">Romans 8:1–17</a>',        "dailyVerse": {          "ref": '',          "text": 'Your world is dramatically broken and you are still riddled with flaws, but Jesus is present, gracious, and faithful.'        },        "body": 'You and I have two big problems. First, we live in a dramatically broken world that does not function the way God intended. You will not live in this fallen world without suffering in some way. Perhaps it will be a situation of heartbreaking injustice. Maybe you’ll be the victim of an act of violence. Perhaps you’ll suffer a divorce or the betrayal of a friend. Maybe you’ll be robbed or mugged. Perhaps, like many, you’ll suffer under the weight of corrupt government. Maybe a disease will infect and weaken your body. But even if none of these things comes your way, you’ll suffer the hardship and toil of living in a world where things simply don’t work in the way that God designed. But that’s not all. You’ll also be required to deal with the endless temptations that wait for you around every corner. What God says is ugly will be presented to you as beautiful. Seductive voices will whisper untruths in your ears. You’ll be tempted to desire things that are outside God’s plan for you. If you don’t take the fallenness of your world seriously, you’ll live with unrealistic expectations and be naive to temptation.\nBut we have a second and even more fundamental problem. It is far more troublesome than the evil that is outside us. It’s the evil inside us. If you’re God’s child, the power of sin has been broken in God’s justifying grace, but the presence of sin still remains and is being progressively eradicated by sanctifying grace. This means sin still lives inside you. Your trouble is never just environmental, it is always also internal. If you were completely pure in heart, life in this fallen world would be infinitely easier. But if you embrace the theology of the heart that is in Scripture, you know that sin is first a heart problem before it is ever a behavior problem.\nHere’s what you and I need to understand and never forget: it is only ever the evil inside us that hooks us to the evil outside us. Sin makes me susceptible to the lure of temptation. Temptation plays to the evil desires and idolatrous cravings that still live in my heart. Temptation appeals to my selfishness and greed. Temptation targets my laziness and impatience. Temptation hooks my materialism and discontent. Temptation goes after my desire to have my own way and write my own rules.\nBut in his grace, Jesus is present to help us overcome both of these problems:\n“Where sin increased, grace abounded all the more” (Rom. 5:20). Isn’t it good to know that “as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord” (v. 21)?',        "dailyPrayer": {          "title": '',          "text": ''        }      }      ,"11-30": {        "title": '',        "note": '',        "passage": 'For further study and encouragement: John 15:1–17',        "dailyVerse": {          "ref": '',          "text": 'You were created to be dependent. God welcomes your dependency with his grace, so why would you want to go it on your own?'        },        "body": 'Wrapped into the devious temptation of the Serpent in the garden were two foundational lies. These lies have been believed somehow, some way by every person who has ever lived. If you’re a parent, you’ve seen the acceptance of them in your children from a very early age.\nThe first lie is the lie of autonomy. This lie tells you that you are an independent human, that your life belongs to you, and that you have the right to live your life as you please. It is an attractive and seductive lie. Believing this lie makes a little child protest when he’s told to go to bed or to eat his peas.\nHowever, the doctrine of creation destroys the lie of autonomy. Think with me.\nCreation depicts ownership. I am a painter by avocation. Once I have composed, painted, and completed a painting, it belongs to me because I made it. You can buy it from me or I can gift it to you, but until I relinquish it, it is mine because I created it. Since God created you and me, we belong to him. We don’t own our mentality, our spirituality, our emotionality, our psychology, our personality, or our physicality. We are not independent beings and we do not have a natural right to do with our physical and spiritual selves whatever we desire to do.Autonomy is a life-destroying lie.\nThe second lie is the lie of self-sufficiency.  This lie tells you that you have everything within yourself to be what you’re supposed to be and to do what you’re supposed to do. This lie explains why a little child struggling to tie his shoelaces will slap his mom’s hand away when she tries to help, even though he has no idea how to make a bow. However, the doctrine of creation destroys this lie as well. Creation depicts dependency. The flower you plant in your garden is not self-sufficient. If it is not weeded and not watered, it will not grow. You and I were created to be dependent, first on God and second on others in interdependent relationships. Immediately after creating Adam and Eve, God began to talk to them because he knew they had no capacity to figure life out on their own. The lie of self-sufficiency is also life-destroying because it causes us to resist the help of our Creator—the very help we were designed to need and he is willing to give.\nGoing it on your own simply does not work. The self-made man is always poorly made. Here is an argument for how much we need grace. It takes an act of grace to release us from our bondage to these lies so that we will confess our need for grace and then seek the grace that is our only hope in life and death. It really does take grace to know how much you need grace.

It shapes the decisions and investments that we make. It calms our fears or leaves us scared and feeling alone. It turns all of us into theologians and philosophers. Where we land in this pursuit shapes the way we look at life and interpret the things that happen to us. It proves that we don’t live by instinct or by impersonal determinative forces. It exposes the fact that we are deeply spiritual beings. It is one of our most foundational quests. As different as we are one from another, in this way we are all the same. We all are looking for something in which to place our hope. We’re all in search of security.\nI don’t know if you’ve thought about this, but there are only two places to look for hope. You can search for it horizontally, thinking that something in creation will give you the security, peace, and inner sense of well-being that you seek, or you can seek it vertically, entrusting your life into the loving hands of your Creator. People put their hope in the creation all the time. They seek satisfaction of heart in the love of other human beings or in the success of their careers. They think their hearts will be satisfied by a certain set of achievements or by a certain catalog of possessions. But none of these things has the power to satisfy your heart. They are all meant to point you to the one place where you heart will find secure rest. You and I need to face this reality—creation will never be our savior!\nSo where is hope to be found, hope that will never disappoint or shame you?\nIt really is found in three of the most glorious words ever penned in human language. These words have the power to transform you and everything about you. These words can end your frantic search and give your weary heart rest.\nThese words describe the One who alone is capable of carrying your hope: “God is love” (1 John 4:16). Because he is love and because he has placed his love on you, you have security and hope even in those scary moments when it feels as if you have neither. The One who is love sent his Son of love to be a sacrifice of love so you and I could be rescued by his love and rest in that love forever and ever.',        "dailyPrayer": {          "title": '',          "text": ''        }},"12-02": {        "title": '',        "note": '',        "passage": 'For further study and encouragement: 1 Thessalonians 5:23–24',        "dailyVerse": {          "ref": '',          "text": 'If you are not fully formed into the image of Jesus, your Redeemer is neither satisfied nor finished, and neither should you be.'        },        "body": 'We don’t talk about it much. It doesn’t find its way into our theological outlines.\nIt’s not the typical way we think about our Redeemer. Yet it is an observation that not only gives you hope, but defines for you what your Lord is doing right here, right now. Here it is—you serve a dissatisfied Redeemer. You ought to be very thankful that your Lord isn’t easily satisfied. He does not do his work poorly or incompletely. He does not walk away from what he has begun until it is perfectly finished. He does not grow bored, tired, discouraged, or distracted.\nHe does not have a short attention span. He does not suffer from redemptive attention deficit disorder. He never grows impatient. He isn’t irritated by how long his work is taking. He never wishes that he hadn’t begun in the first place.\nHe never tries to rush what takes time. He never uses his power to turn what must be a process into an event. He never wonders if it’s worth it and contemplates calling it all off.\nYour Redeemer is zealous for one goal—the final renewal of all things.\nUltimate salvation from all that sin is and all that sin has broken is his unrelenting pursuit. He will continue to unleash his power to accomplish redemption and he will not be satisfied until the last enemy is under his feet and the final kingdom has come. Yes, there is great and eternal hope for you in the dissatisfaction of your Redeemer.\nOur problem is that we are all too easily satisfied. We’re satisfied with a little bit of theological knowledge, a degree of biblical literacy, occasional moments of ministry, and a measure of personal spiritual growth. We’re sadly satisfied with being a little bit better when God’s goal is that we be completely remolded into his image. In fact, it is even worse than that. Not only are we too easily satisfied, willing to stop before the Redeemer’s work is fully accomplished in us, we are all very easily distracted. We get distracted by the temporary glories of the created world, and we actually begin to think that we can find our satisfaction there. So we quit pressing on because our Redeemer is pressing on. While he, in glorious dissatisfaction, still works to redeem us from us, we are out chasing other lovers. We begin to believe that they can do for us what he alone can do. We begin to invest our time, energy, and hope in things that can never deliver.\nHope is not found in the places where our hearts look for satisfaction, but in the dissatisfaction of our Redeemer. He will complete his work even in those moments when we don’t care that he does.',        "dailyPrayer": {          "title": '',          "text": ''        }      },"12-03": {        "title": '',        "note": '',        "passage": 'For further study and encouragement: Romans 11',        "dailyVerse": {          "ref": '',          "text": 'Corporate worship is a regular, gracious reminder that it’s not about you.\nYou’ve been born into a life that is a celebration of another.'        },        "body": 'Corporate worship is a celebration that serves as a very important reminder for us all. We gather together to celebrate the One who created, controls, and sits at the center of all things. Every biblical worship service is guided and shaped by the words of Romans 11:33–36:\nOh, the depths of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!\n“For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor?” \n“Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid?”\nFor from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen.\nThe final verse says it all. It is not only a prescription for every worship service, but also a powerful statement about what life is all about. Life is not about us. It is not about our wants, our needs, or our feelings. It is not about our comfort, pleasure, and ease. It is not about us getting our personal definition of happiness. It’s not about our satisfaction and contentment. It’s not about how many of our dreams we actually get to experience. It’s not about our successes and achievements. It’s not about how successfully we avoid difficulty and suffering. It’s not about how well our relationships are working.\nIt’s not wrong to desire personal happiness, peace, a healthy body, and healthy relationships. The issue is this—these things must not rule our hearts, because when they do, they place us at the center of our world and make it all about us. It is sad that many people, even professing Christians, live in a way that is God-forgetting and God-replacing. We put ourselves in the center, we decide for ourselves what we want life to be like, and we reduce God to little more than the delivery system for our catalog of self-oriented dreams.\nSo corporate worship calls us back again and again to remember and to celebrate. It calls us to remember that all that exists, including us, is from God, exists through him, and points to him. He is the beginning, the center, and the end of all things. His will is preeminent and will be done. His kingdom will come. Grace decimates our lordship and causes us to bow to the one true Lord. It is only by grace that we celebrate a lordship other than our own.

It is a theme that cannot be repeated too much. It is a practical concern that touches everything that we think, desire, say, and do. It reaches to the deepest levels of human motivation. It sits at the epicenter of our spiritual struggles. It is one of the underlying causes of the most important battles of the heart. It exposes the deepest wishes of our souls. It is at the heart of why we were created. It expresses God’s will for everyone who has ever taken a breath. It is the great moral dividing line. And it is the reason Jesus had to come.\n\nLife is all about glory. Sin is all about glory. Grace is all about glory.\n\nSpirituality is all about glory. Heaven and hell are all about glory. Submission and rebellion are all about glory. Love and hatred are all about glory. A life of demand and a life of service are both propelled by glory. Contentment and craving are both motivated by glory. Every word you speak and every action you take is directed by glory. Glory causes you to want some things and despise others. Glory makes you arrogant and causes you to be humble. Glory reduces you to a thief or motivates you to give. Glory makes your heart glad or causes it to be eaten with envy. Glory makes you constantly thankful for a Savior or causes you to forget he exists.\n\nWe human beings were hardwired for glory. Glory orientation was woven into the fabric of our hearts. We were designed this way so that we would be able to take in all the glories of creation and so that those glories would point us to the one glory that is truly glorious and alone able to satisfy our hearts, the glory of God. This means that we are always living in pursuit of some kind of glory. Either our hearts have been captured by the temporary glories of the created world or by grace they have been captured by the eternally satisfying glory of God. We are working for our own glory, pursuing some created glory, or living for God’s glory. But we are always living for glory. \n\nJesus came to liberate us from our addiction to glories that will never satisfy our hearts. He came to free us from our bondage to our own glory and our obsession with the shadow glories of the created world.

When we call them needs, we tell ourselves that we have to have them, that we cannot live without them, and that we have a right to demand them. So we end up evaluating the love of God on the basis of how many of the things that we have christened as needs he has delivered to us. As we do this, our lives get shaped by a needs focus, and we spend so much time thinking about and working toward acquiring our needs that we have little personal time left for the larger pursuits of the kingdom of God.\nBecause of this, Philippians 4:10–20 is very instructive for us: <p style="padding-left: 30px;"> <i>I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length you have revived your concern for me.

I can do all things through him who strengthens me.\nYet it was kind of you to share my trouble.

It is what we all deal with every day. It’s what causes us to lose our way. It’s what leads us to live in a way that is contradictory to what we profess to believe. It’s what makes us susceptible to temptation. We are all still in possession of wandering hearts. We would like to think that our hearts are perfectly faithful and true, but they are not. We would like to think that nothing could lure us away from our loyalty to our Lord. We would like to think that our moral commitments are unshakable. We would like to think that what God says is wrong would not be attractive to us. We would like to think that we always think God’s thoughts after him and that our desires are always in the right place. We would like to think all of these things. But the problem is that we still have fickle hearts.\nYou see, our biggest problem is not that we live with flawed people who bring trouble our way. Our great difficulty is not that we live in a fallen world where temptation tends to greet us around every corner. The big issue for us is not that we live in a world that isn’t operating the way God intended, as a result of which we face difficulty, disease, suffering, loss, and grief. No, our big difficulty is that sin still resides in our hearts. It still distorts our thoughts and redirects our desires. The less-than-perfect people, the temptations around us, and the broken world in which we live are problems for us because we have this problem in our hearts. It is humbling, but it is important to remember that it is only ever the sin inside us that hooks us to the sin outside of us. So what we need most is not a change of location or relationship, but a fundamental rescue of heart, and that is exactly what God’s grace in the person of the Holy Spirit provides for us.',        "dailyPrayer": {          "title": '',          "text": ''        }      }       ,"12-07": {        "title": '',        "note": '',        "passage": 'For further study and encouragement: <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/114/HEB.2.NKJV?parallel=151">Hebrews 2:14–18</a>',        "dailyVerse": {          "ref": '',          "text": ''        },        "body": 'No one knows you more deeply and fully than your Savior, so no one offers you help formfitted for your deepest needs like he does.\nIt is one of the most comforting passages in all of the New Testament. It is one that you and I should meditate on again and again:\nSince then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. (Heb. 4:14–16)\nThis passage is a call to live with hope, encouragement, courage, and confidence. Why? Not only because you have a High Priest who has passed through the heavens and now sits at the right hand of the Father on high, but also because he is sympathetic to your weaknesses. But there is more. He is sympathetic to your weaknesses because he hears and answers you from the vantage point of an experiential basis of knowledge of exactly what you are going through. He came to earth and, from the time he was an infant until he ascended after his resurrection, he faced the full range of the sufferings and temptations that we face. He knows what it is like to be homeless, hungry, and rejected. He is acquainted with disease and physical pain. He knows the power of accusation and injustice. He faced the siren voice of temptation. He knows what it is like to be forsaken by loved ones. He understands suffering and death.\nHe stared evil in the face. He knows us and has a firsthand understanding of what we deal with day in and day out.\nThe word translated as “weaknesses” in this passage is profound. It’s almost untranslatable. It is used in many ways. It’s probably best understood as “the human condition.” Our High Priest understands what it is like to be a human being in this fallen world because, in an act of shocking, condescending love, he took on human flesh and lived with us as a man. Now, as the resurrected and ascended man, he sits next to the Father as our High Priest. This means that our struggles and prayers are not greeted with harshness, condemnation, or impatience, but with understanding and sympathy.\nAll of this means that we can rest assured that we will receive from his hand mercy that is formfitted for the particular needs in which we find ourselves. We can be confident that he hears us with the sympathy of shared experience and, because he does, he will provide for us exactly what we need. Now, that’s amazing grace!',        "dailyPrayer": {          "title": '',          "text": ''        }      }      ,"12-08": {        "title": '',        "note": '',        "passage": 'For further study and encouragement: <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/114/HEB.4.NKJV?parallel=151">Hebrews 4:1–13</a>',        "dailyVerse": {          "ref": '',          "text": ''        },        "body": ' If Christ is your life, you are free from the desperate quest to find life in situations, locations, and relationships.\nIt is a wonderful freedom that we just don’t think about and discuss enough.

It is a sweet gift of grace that is given to you right here, right now.\nYou never could have found it on your own. You never could have earned or achieved it. You still can’t stand before God and say that you deserve it. It is a gift that is not to be ignored or misunderstood.\nYou have been given Christ, and in being given Christ, you have been given life. You don’t need to search for meaning and purpose. You don’t need to search for identity. You don’t need to look for something to give you the inner sense of well-being that every person wants. You don’t have to wonder if you’ll ever be loved. You don’t have to worry that your life and work will result in nothing. You don’t have to wonder if you’ll have what you need to face what will be on your plate today. You don’t have to worry about your future. You will never be left to the limited range of your own resources. You will never, ever be left alone. There is always someone who understands you and offers you the help that you need.

You don’t have to worry, because you have a Savior who has invaded your life with his grace and has made you the place where he dwells.\nSo you have been freed from the endless quest for life that consumes so many people.

They look to people and possessions to give them peace. They don’t know it, but they are asking the situations, locations, and relationships of everyday life to be their saviors. Sadly, they’re drinking from wells that are dry and eating bread that will never satisfy. The situations, locations, and relationships of daily life are wonderful to enjoy, but we must understand that they will never, ever satisfy our hearts. For that, we have been given a true Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.\nSo instead of wasting time on that endless quest for life, you have been invited to enter into God’s rest for the rest of your life. Rest in your identity as his child. Rest in his eternal love. Rest in his powerful grace. Rest in his constant presence and faithful provision. Rest in his patience and forgiveness.

Will he abandon you now in your moment of need?\nThe Bible isn’t a series of stories. It isn’t a catalog of interesting characters. It isn’t a manual of theology. It isn’t a book of interesting wisdom principles. One story, with one hero, forms the cord that holds the whole Bible together. The Bible is essentially the story of redemption. This grand redemptive story, with God’s essential explanatory notes, is the main content of the Word of God.\nThe Bible displays for us the extent to which God has gone in order to provide salvation for us. He really controlled every event in human history, and he really harnessed the forces of nature so that at a certain time his Son would come and live, suffer, die, and rise again to provide salvation for us. It is a stunning story that should provide the interpretive grid for everything you face in your life in this broken world.\nIf God went to such lengths as to control the events of the world and to sacrifice his one and only Son, would it make any sense at all for him to abandon you between the “already” of your justification and the “not yet” of your final glorification? Would it make any sense for him to turn his back on you now?\nWould it make any sense for him to ignore you in your hour of need? Would you expend a great amount of personal effort and sacrifice to secure something of value and then not work to keep, maintain, and protect it?\nThe fact that you are precious in God’s sight is clear because he purchased you at a great price. No higher price could be paid than the death of the Messiah.\nBut that’s exactly the price that God paid to redeem you and me. Since he paid such a price, we can rest assured he will expend his divine power and grace to protect, mature, provide for, and keep us until we are with him in a place where the dangers of sin and death are no more. Paul says it this way: “If he freely gave us Jesus, doesn’t it make sense that he will also give us everything that we need?” (see Rom. 8:31–33).\nSo don’t let any evil enemy whisper lies into your ear. Don’t let him tell you that you are alone, that you’re left to your own resources, or that God doesn’t hear or care. Don’t let yourself doubt God’s presence and his goodness. Don’t let yourself wonder if you’ll make it through. God unleashed his power to make you his own, and he will continue to unleash his power to keep and protect you until you are with him forever in that place where you will need his protection no more because the final enemy will be under his feet.',        "dailyPrayer": {          "title": '',          "text": ''        }      }      ,"12-10": {        "title": '',        "note": '',        "passage": 'For further study and encouragement: <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/114/PSA.51.NKJV?parallel=151">Psalm 51</a>',        "dailyVerse": {          "ref": '',          "text": ''        },        "body": 'It is a grace to be willing to listen to and consider criticism. It takes grace to quiet the mind and settle the heart to hear.\nWe are not naturally open to criticism. Most of us don’t like to be confronted. It is natural for us to rise to our own defenses when we are questioned. It is natural for us to work to convince ourselves and others that we are righteous. When questioned, it is natural for us to get out our catalogs of righteousness as evidence to convince others that they must have misjudged or misunderstood us.\nIt is natural for us to be more focused on and concerned about the sin of others than our own. It is natural for us to confront others with things that we excuse in ourselves. It is natural for us to see our wrongs as less than wrong. It is natural for us to swindle ourselves into believing that we are far more righteous than we really are. For sinners, self-righteousness is more natural than humility.\nIn short, it is more natural for us to have hard hearts that are resistant to change than hearts that are open, humble, and crying out for change. So if you are open to loving confrontation, if you are ready to admit your sin, if you are thankful for those who have loved you enough to help you see what you would not see on your own, and if you are ready to confess and seek forgiveness, you know that you have been visited by the grace of Jesus, because none of these attitudes is natural for us apart from divine intervention.\nIt takes powerful redeeming grace to remove the hearts of stone from us and replace them with hearts of flesh—hearts that are sensitive to sin, sensitive to the grace of conviction, sensitive to the need for change, and resting in the forgiveness that is found only in Jesus. It takes grace that guarantees that the blood of Jesus has covered everything about us that could ever be known or exposed to give us the courage to look at ourselves in the searching mirror of the Word of God. It takes grace for us to let go of excuses, rationalizations, self-atoning arguments, and our tendency to shift the blame to others. It takes grace for us to be able to stand as sinners before a holy God and admit that there are ways in which we are still rebels against his lordship and his commands.\nConfession is not intuitive for sinners. Humility is not our natural first response. Love of God more than love of self is not a first instinct. The glory of God isn’t naturally the core motivator of what we do and say. So if you are willing to say, “God, show me my heart,” and willing to speak these words, “Please forgive me,” you know that you have been showered with amazing grace —grace that has already changed your heart and grace that promises more change to come.',        "dailyPrayer": {          "title": '',          "text": ''        }      },  "12-11": {    "title": '',    "note": '',    "passage": 'For further study and encouragement: <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/114/1SA.15.NKJV">1 Samuel 15</a>',    "dailyVerse": {      "ref": '',      "text": ''    },    "body": 'If obedience is a personal act of worship, then disobedience is personal too.\nEvery sin is a violation of a relationship - a sin against God.\nI think that we often misunderstand what sin is about, and in so doing, we minimize how horrible it really is. If you unwittingly devalue the heinous nature of sin, you will also devalue the grace that alone is able to rescue you from it.\nThe first way we devalue sin is to think that sin is about behavior and behavior alone. But that is not what the Bible teaches. Sin is first and foremost a matter of the heart (see Jesus’s teaching in the Sermon on the Mount, <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/114/MAT.5.NKJV">Matthew 5–7</a>). Since you live out of the heart (see <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/114/LUK.6.43">Luke 6:43–45</a>), sin always originates there. Sin is always a matter of the thoughts, desires, motives, and choices of the heart. Sin is a matter of the heart that expresses itself in the behavior of the body - your body physically goes where your heart has already gone. This is precisely why we need rescuing grace. We can run from a certain situation, location, or relationship, but we have no ability whatsoever to escape our hearts; for that, we need rescuing grace.\nSecond, we tend to think of sin as the breaking of a set of abstract rules. But sin is much more than that. Sin is the breaking of a relationship that results in breaking God’s rules. Remember, the Ten Commandments begin with a call to worship God above all else. You see, it is only when God is in his rightful place in my heart that I desire to live in a way that pleases him. If God is not in his rightful place, I insert myself in his place, write my own laws, and give myself to doing what pleases me. So every sin is against God. Every sin is an assault on God’s rightful place. Every sin is a betrayal of him. Every sin steals glory from him. Every sin denies his existence and his authority. Every sin replaces him with something else. Every sin quests for his power and his glory. Every sin is after his throne.\nSin is personal and relational, even if you are not conscious of it at the moment when you are sinning. That is why it is right for David, who has just committed adultery and murder, to say, “Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight” (Ps. 51:4). David is not minimizing the horrible wrongs he did against Bathsheba, Uriah, and the people of Israel. What he’s doing is confessing the core of what sin is about. Sin questions God’s goodness, wisdom, faithfulness, and love. Sin challenges God’s personal rule.\nSin says that you know better than God. Sin is personal, and that is why Jesus suffered and died so that you and I would receive forgiving grace.',    "dailyPrayer": {      "title": '',      "text": ''    }},  "12-12": {    "title": '',    "note": '',    "passage": 'For further study and encouragement: <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/114/MRK.15.NKJV">Mark 15:33-39</a>',    "dailyVerse": {      "ref": '',      "text": ''    },    "body": 'No matter how people treat you today, if you’re God’s child, you’re being loved right now by an ever-present, ever-loving Redeemer.\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Who has believed what he has heard from us?\nAnd to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?\nFor he grew up before him like a young plant, and like a root out of dry ground; he had no form or majesty that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him.\nHe was despised and rejected by men;\na man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not.\nSurely he has borne our griefs\nand carried our sorrows;\nyet we esteemed him stricken,\nsmitten by God, and afflicted… .\nHe was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth.\nBy oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as for his generation, who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living, stricken for the transgression of my people?\nAnd they made his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death, although he had done no violence,\nand there was no deceit in his mouth.\n(Isa. 53:1–4, 7–9)</em></p>\nIt is incredibly encouraging to think about as you and I make our way through a world that is marked by hatred, violence, injustice, racism, betrayal, disloyalty, selfishness, abuse, and many other forms of relational sin and brokenness.

He was willing to face rejection. He was willing to subject himself to hatred and violence. He was even willing to have the Father turn his back on him. Why was he willing to do all this? He did it willingly so that, as his children, you and I would be able to live in the hope and peace of knowing that no matter what we face in the human community, we are perfectly and eternally loved by him.

It is a radical way of living, quite different from the worldview that is preached all around us.\nThe common cultural worldview has you at the very center. It says that life is all about your pursuit of happiness. When someone or something makes you unhappy, it says that the world is not operating the way it is supposed to operate. It really does pull the walls of your motivation and concern to the tight confines of your wants, your needs, and your feelings. But the Bible presents a polar opposite worldview that is to form the identity and lifestyle of every believer. Scripture asserts that you were bought with a price (the life and death of Jesus), so you don’t belong to you anymore (actually, because of creation, you never did belong to you). Take time to look at 1 Corinthians 6:12–20, which applies this truth to something as personal as your sexual life.\nGod has a purpose for you. It is that you would live as one of his representatives; that is, that you would live representatively. And what are you representing? You are called to represent your Savior King. And what does that practically look like? Representing the King means you represent his message, his methods, and his character. Representing the King’s message means that you look at every situation and relationship in life through the lens of the truth of Scripture—the center of which is the gospel of Jesus Christ—and determine to help others look at life that way too. Representing his methods means that you seek to be a tool of the kind of change he intends to make in people and in the world around you. And representing his character simply means asking yourself again and again, “What of the person, work, and character of the Lord Jesus Christ does this person need to see in the situation that he or she is now in?”\nThere is no better word for this bigger-purpose-than-my-happiness way of living that God has called each of us to than the word ambassador.

Sin causes us all to name ourselves righteous. Sin seduces us into thinking we are somehow, some way smarter than God. Sin causes us all to trust in our own wisdom. Sin makes us all want to write our own rules. Sin makes us resistant to criticism and change. Sin makes our eyes and our hearts wander. Sin causes us to crave material things more than spiritual provision. Sin causes us to want and esteem pleasure more than character. In our quest to be God, sin causes us to forget God. It reduces us all to glory thieves, taking for ourselves the glory that belongs to him. All of this means that sin causes us to step over God’s wise boundaries in thought, desire, word, and action again and again.

Notice how Paul talks about our submission to the will of the Father: “Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure” (Phil. 2:12–13).\nHere is a call to a faith-filled life of submission and obedience. It is a call to be serious about the life that grace has made possible for you. The passage is a call to follow the example of the Lord Jesus Christ. But then Paul reminds you that if you follow, if you obey, and if you do what is right in the eyes of your Savior, you can take no credit whatsoever. This is because your right desires and your right actions exist only because of his indwelling presence and ever-active grace. Paul is saying that we do the right that we do because grace is at that moment rescuing us from ourselves. Grace is protecting us from the self-righteousness and self-sovereignty that would make us all too independent and all too rebellious.\nEvery moment of our obedience is an evidence of and a celebration of the grace that not only forgives but rescues, and not only rescues but transforms.

Yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me. I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation.

This passage, like so many others, welcomes us to honesty. We aren’t called to pretend. We’re not forced to act as if things are okay when they’re not okay. Biblical faith never asks us to deny the harsh realities of life in this fallen world. God invites our cries and welcomes us to run to him in our grief. This passage is a compassionate and honest warning about the inescapable troubles that we all face between the “already” and the “not yet.”</li><li style="padding-left: 30px;">In your troubles, you need to remember that what you’re experiencing is part of God’s plan. Jesus is announcing something to his disciples that is discouraging and encouraging at the same time. He is telling his disciples that it is the plan of God for his glory and their good to keep them in a world that is terribly broken and therefore does not function in the way that God intended. You and I should never think that the troubles that we face are an indication of the failure of God’s plan and his promises. No, this present suffering exists under his rule and according to his wise and loving plan.</li><li style="padding-left: 30px;">In your troubles, you are invited to remember that you are never alone. Here Jesus speaks personally. Even when forsaken by all of his followers, he says it is impossible for him to be alone because his Father is with him. In the same way, as God’s children, you and I are never left alone in our troublesome circumstances. God, in power, wisdom, and grace, is always with us. This means that in times of trouble, we are never left with the ministry resources of our own power.</li><li style="padding-left: 30px;">In your troubles, you need to know that your troubles may overcome you, but they cannot overcome the Savior who protects and keeps you.

I knew what was facing me because I had been through it before. I would arrive at the locker room, where the lingering smell of yesterday’s sweat mixed with that of the ointment we were rubbing on yesterday’s bruises. As we slowly put on our equipment, our desire to be there mixed with our knowledge of the hardship that was before us. On the field, under the blazing sun and after a series of grueling drills, you wanted to vomit, to have just a moment to breathe, or to walk off the field and quit altogether. Night was taken up with ingesting a huge amount of food, taking a scalding-hot bath, receiving a rubdown, and getting to bed early. Morning came quickly and the routine started all over again.\nThis was the daily routine of the two-a-day summer football practices. It was a grueling but amazingly efficient way of preparing us for the season to come. It really did separate the men from the boys. It taught us to work through pain. It taught us the importance of getting each play right. It taught us how to work together and the importance of following the commands of the coach. And most of all, it whipped our bodies into shape. At the end of the summer, you weren’t as breathless as before and you couldn’t remember the last time you wanted to vomit in the middle of practice. Those two-a-day practices were hard, but they were for our good. And they weren’t our destination, but a preparation for the destination of the football season that was to come.\nYes, your life is hard right now. You are being called to do difficult things under the heat of the sun of this fallen world. You are called to say no to feelings of discouragement and the desire to quit. You are called to persevere, doing the same good things over and over again until they become second nature to you. You are called to work with others who are going through the same hardship and you are called to submit to the wise commands of your Savior King. You will face hardship tomorrow and the day to follow, but your hardship will not last forever. Yes, there will be moments of comfort along the way—times of rest, healing, and retreat—but they will be followed by more hardship. You must face these repeated hardships because the place where you are is not your destination. No, it is a place of preparation for the final destination that is to come. Preparation is hard, but you and I aren’t ready, so we need to be made ready for the final place that will be our home.\nToday, thank God that he has a home waiting for you and that he loves you enough to use hardship to make you ready for your welcome to your final home.

I wish I could say that all the time and in every way I hate what God hates, but I don’t. I wish I could say that I always love to do what is right, but I don’t. I wish I could say that I never think that my way is better than God’s way, but I can’t. I wish my heart were forever settled with staying inside God’s boundaries, but it isn’t. I wish I could say that my war with sin is over, but it’s not.\nHere’s the danger for me and for you: sin doesn’t always look sinful to us. It’s hard to admit it, but sometimes sin actually looks beautiful to us. The man lusting after the woman in the mall doesn’t actually see something ugly and dangerous. No, he sees beauty. The guy who is cheating on his taxes doesn’t see the moral danger of deception. He sees the excitement of having additional money to satisfy his desires. The woman gossiping on the phone doesn’t see the destructiveness of what she’s doing because she is taken up with the buzz of passing a tale. The child who is rebelling against the will of her parents doesn’t see the danger that she’s placing herself in because she is captivated by the thrill of her temporary independence. Part of the deceptive power of sin in my heart is its ability to look beautiful when it is actually terribly ugly.\nSo we need help, and God in grace has met us with that help. This help doesn’t come to us first in a theology or a set of commands or principles; it comes to us in a person. God knew that my struggle with sin would be so great that it would not be enough to forgive me. That forgiveness is a wonderful thing, but I need more. So God not only forgives, but he also gets inside me by his Spirit. The Spirit that now lives inside me is a Warrior Spirit, who by grace does battle with my sin even in moments when I don’t care to. His redemptive zeal is unstoppable. Think of Peter, who denied any knowledge of Christ. Was it the end of his story? No, but not because Peter had the sense to pursue Jesus; it was because Jesus, in unrelenting, forgiving grace, pursued Peter (see John 18:12–14, 25–27; 21:15–19).\nIn our battle with sin, are we called to wrestle, run, fight, and pray? Yes, we are, but our hope is not in our ability to do these things, but in the God of grace, who will war with sin until sin is no more. He never grows tired, never gets frustrated, and never gives up.

He is despised and rejected, then subjected to a bloody and painful public crucifixion. And he does it all intentionally and willingly so that those rebels will be forgiven, so that those separated from God will have a home with him forever, and so that grace will be supplied to people in desperate need of it.\nThe words of the wonderful old Christmas hymn “Thou Didst Leave Thy Throne” capture so well the stunning contrast between Jesus’s suffering and our resultant blessing:\nThou didst leave Thy throne and Thy kingly crown, When Thou camest to earth for me; But in Bethlehem’s home was there found no room For Thy holy nativity.\nHeaven’s arches rang when the angels sang, Proclaiming Thy royal degree; But of lowly birth didst Thou come to earth, And in great humility.\nThe foxes found rest, and the birds their nest In the shade of the forest tree; But Thy couch was the sod, O Thou Son of God, In the deserts of Galilee.\nThou camest, O Lord, with the living Word, That should set Thy people free; But with mocking scorn and with crown of thorn, They bore Thee to Calvary.\nWhen the heav’ns shall ring, and her choirs shall sing, At Thy coming to victory, Let Thy voice call me home, saying “Yet there is room, There is room at My side for thee.”\nThis Christmas, remember that you have an eternal home, because in amazing grace Jesus was willing to leave his home and have no home.',    "dailyPrayer": {      "title": '',      "text": ''    }},  "12-22": {    "title": '',    "note": '',    "passage": 'For further study and encouragement: John 12:27–36',    "dailyVerse": {      "ref": '',      "text": 'Jesus faced separation from his Father in the here and now so that we would know the Father’s acceptance now and for all eternity.'    },    "body": 'Jesus faced separation from his Father in the here and now so that we would know the Father’s acceptance now and for all eternity.\nJesus knew what he was facing. He knew the price that needed to be paid. He knew what it would mean to stand in our place. He was quite aware of the spiritual math: suffering for a moment = acceptance for all of eternity. And he was willing.\nA great moral tragedy was being played out every day in the lives of every person born into this sin-shattered world. Unlike anything else, God had created human beings in his image and for intimate, loving, and worshipful community with him. A relationship with him was to be the deepest, most influential motivation in their lives. It was meant to shape every thought, every desire, every word, and every action. And this community between God and people was meant to be unbroken forever and ever. But it had been broken in an outrageous act of rebellion and sedition. Not only had Adam and Eve stepped over God’s clear boundaries, but also they had quested for his position. So in the saddest moment in human history, they had been driven out of the garden and away from God’s presence.\nFrom the vantage point of creation, it was all very unthinkable. People living separate from God? This was like fish without water, honey that is not sweet, or a sun that provides no heat. Not only did it defy the logic and design of creation, it could not work. Human beings were not hardwired to live independently. We were not made to function on our own and to live based on our own wisdom. We were not created to live by our own limited resources. We were made to live in a constant, life-giving connection to God. People’s separation from God was a functional and moral disaster.\nSo this disaster had to be addressed. The tragic gap between God and man had to be bridged, and there was only one way. Jesus would have to come to earth as the second Adam and live a perfect life in our place. He would have to bear the punishment for our rebellion and endure the unthinkable—the Father’s rejection. It happened at that horrible ninth hour on the day of his crucifixion, when, in a loud voice, he cried, “Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?” (“My God, my\nGod, why have you forsaken me?”) (Mark 15:34). This was Jesus’s most painful moment of anguish as he took on himself the tragedy of our separation from God.\nThis moment really was the epicenter of the Christmas story. It was why Jesus came. It was why the angels rejoiced at his coming. He came to be the temporarily separated Son so that we can be the eternally accepted children of God.

This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, “Out of Egypt I called my son.”\nThen Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, became furious, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men. Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah:\n“A voice was heard in Ramah,\nweeping and loud lamentation,\nRachel weeping for her children;\nshe refused to be comforted, because they are no more.” (Matt. 2:13–18) The Christmas story is this—that babe in the manger was the Son of the Most High God. He willingly came to a place where such unthinkable violence and injustice exists. The wrath of the ruler would eventually fall on him. He would die a violent death at the hands of evil men. Followers would weep that the Messiah was dead, but he would rise again and complete the work that he came to earth to do.\nAs we sit beneath a beautifully decorated tree and eat the rich food of celebration, we must not let ourselves forget the horror and violence at the beginning and end of the Christmas story. This story begins with a horrible slaughter of children and ends with the violent murder of the Son of God. The slaughter depicts how much the earth needs grace. The murder is the moment when that grace is given.\nLook into that manger and see the One who came to die. Hear the angels’\nsong and remember that death would be the only way that peace would be given.\nLook at your tree and remember another tree—one not decorated with shining ornaments, but stained with the blood of the Son of God.

The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.\nThere was a man sent from God, whose name was John. He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him. He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light.\nThe true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him. He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.\nAnd the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. (John bore witness about him, and cried out, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.’”) For from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father’s side, he has made him known. (John 1:1–18)\nThe Christmas story really is a light story. No, not the lights that decorate the city where you live, the lights that you have carefully hung on the tree in your living room, or the candles that you have placed in your windows. No, this story is about the light coming into a world that had been sadly cast into darkness.\nUnder the burden of the shroud of rebellion and sin, the world had become a dark place. In the darkness of immorality, injustice, violence, greed, self-righteousness, thievery, racism, and a host of other ills, the world was desperate for light. Everyone was part of the problem and everyone suffered from the problem, but no one could solve the problem.\nGod’s solution was the only way.

Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? As it is written,\n“For your sake we are being killed all the day long;\nwe are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.”\nNo, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

Remember that he readily went unloved so that we would know constant love. Remember that he deserved to be loved, but\nwas rejected so that we who deserve to be rejected would be eternally loved.\nRemember that he was willing to subject himself to the fickle and failing love of his followers so that we would know the faithful and unfailing love of the Father. Remember that he endured separation so that nothing could ever separate us from the Father’s love.\nAs you remember these things, remember this: if God was willing to give up his Son so that we would know his love, doesn’t it make sense that he will also with him give us everything else that we need?

There is nothing natural about this. We naturally think that we have to work our way into God’s favor and earn our way into his presence, but the biblical story is anything but natural. It’s the story of rebels who not only don’t desire a relationship with God, but who could not possibly earn it even if they did. This is a story of divine intervention, of divine substitution, of divine sacrifice, and of divine grace. It is a story of God sending his Son to live as we were meant to live, to die the death that each of us deserves, to satisfy God’s righteous requirement and placate his anger, and to rise out of the grave, conquering sin and death. It is a story of incredible patience, tenderness, compassion, love, mercy, and grace—forgiveness granted, acceptance secured, and righteousness given to those who could not have merited them on their own.\nBut as amazing as the grace of forgiveness and the acceptance of God are, there is still more amazing grace to this story. God knew that the dilemma of our sin was such a deep personal moral disaster that it was not enough to forgive us.\nThat forgiveness should never be minimized, but God knew we needed more. He knew that after our forgiveness and acceptance, we would need daily help. He knew we would need rescue, strength, wisdom, and deliverance. So he didn’t just forgive us. He didn’t just accept us. He came to us and made us the place where he dwells. Paul says it well: “It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me” (Gal. 2:20). I don’t think that we talk about this enough. I don’t think that we celebrate this reality enough. I don’t think we let our hearts consider the wonder of this identity enough. By grace, we are the temple of the Most High God. By grace, he lives in us. By grace, his power is at our disposal. By grace, he fights on our behalf even if we don’t have the sense to do so. By grace, he works within us to complete the labor of grace that he has begun. By grace, he\nanimates us to desire and do what is right. By grace, he exposes us and convicts us. We are able to choose and do what is right only because he lives in us and gives us the power to do so by his grace.

He chose you to experience its pleasure at that moment because he is the God of tender, patient grace: “For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust” (Matt. 5:45).',    "dailyPrayer": {      "title": '',      "text": ''    }},  "12-29": {    "title": '',    "note": '',    "passage": 'For further study and encouragement: Colossians 3:1–17',    "dailyVerse": {      "ref": '',      "text": 'Yes, change is possible, not because you have wisdom and strength, but because you’ve been blessed with the grace of Jesus.'    },    "body": 'Yes, change is possible, not because you have wisdom and strength, but because you’ve been blessed with the grace of Jesus.\nYou’re not stuck. You’re not encased in concrete. Your life is not a dead end.\nThe possibility of change has not slipped through your fingers. Change is possible for you and me even in the places where change seems most hopeless.\nWhy? Because the Giver of transformative grace has made you and me the place where he dwells!\nIf you were to ask what God is doing, what he is working on between the\n“already” of your justification and the “not yet” of your sanctification, the answer could be given in one word: change.\nFirst, there is that work of personal growth and change the theologians call progressive sanctification. It is God’s lifelong commitment to actually make me what he declared me to be in justification—righteous. In every situation, location, and relationship of my life, God is employing people, places, and things as his tools of transformative grace. He is not resting. He does not leave the work of his hands. He takes no breaks; he is relentlessly working to change me into all that his grace makes it possible for me to be. He will not be content for me to be a little bit better. He will work by grace until I am finally and totally free of sin, that is, molded into the image of his perfectly righteous Son.\nThis zealous Savior is also a dissatisfied Creator. He is not content to leave this world in its present sin-scarred condition. So there will come a day when he will make all things new. He will return his world to the condition it was in before sin left it so damaged. Change really is the zeal of your Redeemer.\nPersonal change (Titus 2:11–14) and environmental change (Rev. 2:1–5) are his holy zeal. When you are disappointed in yourself, grieved at the sin in your relationships, or upset with the condition of your world and you cry out for change, you are crying for something that hits right at the center of the zeal of your Savior’s grace.\nChange doesn’t mean that you’ll get your wish list of things that you think will give you the good life. Change doesn’t mean that God will turn the people around you into the people you’d like them to be. And change surely doesn’t\nmean that God will exercise his power to make life easier and more pleasurable according to your definition. But you can rest assured that where real change is needed, there is a God of grace who knows just where that change needs to take place and offers you everything you need so that it can happen.',    "dailyPrayer": {      "title": '',      "text": ''    }},  "12-30": {    "title": '',    "note": '',    "passage": 'For further study and encouragement: Hebrews 6:9–20',    "dailyVerse": {      "ref": '',      "text": 'Corporate worship is designed to instill vertical hope where horizontal hope has been dashed.'    },    "body": 'Corporate worship is designed to instill vertical hope where horizontal hope has been dashed.\nOne of the themes of this devotional is hope. Every human being is hardwired for and concerned about hope.  We’re all in a constant search for hope that delivers and lasts. We’re all a bit discouraged and paralyzed when our hopes are dashed. When one hope dies, we grab hold of another hope as fast as we can.\nThe Bible is a hope story. It is about hope misplaced and hope found. It’s about hope that cannot deliver and hope that gives you everything that you need.\nIt’s about where not to look for hope and the only place where true hope can be found. The great hope drama of the Bible is summarized by a few very important words that are buried in the middle of the apostle Paul’s letter to the Romans: Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God. Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us. (Rom. 5:1–5)\nNotice what Paul does here:\nHe connects our hope to our justification.  We have hope because, by grace, we have been forgiven and accepted by the One who holds everything we need.\nHe connects our hope to the glory of God.  Our hope is that God will complete his work, getting the glory that is his due. His glory is our good.\nHe connects our hope to our sufferings.  There is even hope in suffering because in that suffering the God who is our hope is doing good things in us and for us.\nHe says that our vertical hope (hope in God) will never put us to shame.\nThis means that all other forms of hope fail us in some way. Hope in created things never delivers what hope in the Creator can.\nHe connects our hope to the Holy Spirit who lives inside us.  Here is the\nultimate reason that you and I have hope—God has made us the address where he lives. This means that the One who can do more than we are able to conceive of is constantly with us and constantly working on our behalf.\nNow, that’s hope! As you worship God with other believers and hear the truths of his Word proclaimed, your hope will be rekindled.',    "dailyPrayer": {      "title": '',      "text": ''    }},  "12-31": {    "title": '',    "note": '',    "passage": '•	Scripture Index',    "dailyVerse": {      "ref": '',      "text": ''    },    "body": 'God’s work in you is a process, not an event. It progresses not in three or four huge moments, but in ten thousand little moments of change.\nWell, it’s that season once again. It’s the fodder for blogs, newspaper articles, TV magazine shows, and far too many Twitter posts. It is the time for the annual ritual of dramatic New Year’s resolutions fueled by the hope of immediate and significant personal life change.\nBut the reality is that few smokers have actually quit because of a single moment of resolve. Few obese people have become slim and healthy because of one dramatic moment of commitment. Few people who were deeply in debt have changed their financial lifestyles because they resolved to do so as the old year gave way to the new. And few marriages have been changed by means of one dramatic resolution.\nIs change important? Yes, it is important for all of us in some way. Is commitment essential? Of course! In various ways, all our lives are shaped by the commitments we make. But growth in grace—which has the gospel of Jesus Christ at its heart—simply doesn’t rest its hope on big, dramatic moments of change.\nThe fact of the matter is that the transforming work of grace is more of a mundane process than a series of a few dramatic events. Personal heart and life change is always a process. And where does that process take place? It takes place where you and I live every day. And where do we live? Well, we all have the same address. Our lives don’t lurch from big moment to big moment. No, we all live in the utterly mundane.\nMost of us won’t be written up in history books. Most of us will make only three or four momentous decisions in our lives, and several decades after we die, the people we leave behind will struggle to remember the things we did. You and I live in little moments, and if God doesn’t rule our little moments and doesn’t work to re-create us in the middle of them, then there is no hope for us.\nThe little moments of life are profoundly important precisely because they are the little moments that we live in and that form us. This is where I think “Big Drama Christianity” gets us into trouble. It can cause us to devalue the\nsignificance of the little moments of life and the “small-change” grace that meets us there. And because we devalue the little moments in which we live, we tend not to notice the sin that gets exposed there. We fail to seek the grace that is offered to us. You see, the character of a life is not set in two or three dramatic moments, but in ten thousand little moments. The character that is formed in those little moments shapes how we respond to the big moments of life. And what makes all of this character change possible? Relentless, transforming, little-moment grace. So we wake up each day committed to live in the small moments of our daily lives with open eyes and humble, expectant hearts.\nFor further study and encouragement: John 1:16',    "dailyPrayer": {      "title": '',      "text": ''    }}     }  },  {    "id": "wigglesworth",    "name": "Smith Wigglesworth Devotional",    "author": "Smith Wigglesworth",    "description": "Devotional by Smith Wigglesworth",    "entries": {    "11-27": {        "title": 'Misled by a Voice',        "note": 'Part One',        "passage": 'Scripture reading: <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/114/JDG.6.NKJV?parallel=151">Judges 6:36–7:22</a>',        "dailyVerse": {          "ref": '1 John 4:1',          "text": 'Do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God.'        },        "body": 'Two sisters were saved in our meetings and were filled with the Holy Spirit.

They were so zealous to be missionaries that they were laying aside money and doing everything they could in order to be prepared to go to the mission field.\nOne of them was operating a telegraph machine when she heard a voice in her head, a voice that said something along these lines: "Will you obey me? If you will obey me, I will make you the most wonderful missionary that ever lived." Oh, beloved, try the voices, try the spirits. Only the Devil promises such a thing, but she did not know this; she did not understand. This was exactly what she wanted; it was her heart‘s desire, do you see? And she was so moved by this. The voice added, "And I will find you all the money you need." I have never known this kind of leading to come true, and you never will as long as you live.\nFor example, a man came to me and said, "I have in my hands a certain food for invalids that can raise millions of dollars for the missionaries." I said to him, "I will not have anything to do with it." These things are not a success. God does not work that way. If God wanted you to have gold, He could make it rain on your houses while you were away. He has all the gold, and the cattle on a thousand hills are His (Ps. 50:10).\nWhen anybody preaches for the kingdom‘s sake, God will provide. Seek only God, and the rain will fall.

So the overseer allowed them both to be excused for a time, and they went into a room. The first sister became so excited with these messages, so believing that it was of God, that her white blouse became spotted with blood as she pricked her flesh with the nails of her hand.\n\nThat is never of God. What do I read about the wisdom of God? I read that it is full of peace and gentleness; it is willing to submit; it is without partiality; it is full of goodness and truth. (See James 3:17.)   And, remember, if you ever know anything about God, it will be peace. If you ever know anything about the world, it will be disorder. The peace of God, which passes all understanding (Phil. 4:7), comes to the heart after you are saved. We are “justified by faith,” and “we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (Rom. 5:1). The peace continues until it makes us full of the “hope of the glory of God”  (v. 2).\n\nGod showed me a long time ago, and it has not been taken out of my mind, that if I was disturbed in my spirit and was not at rest, I had missed the plan. How can you miss it? In three ways.\n\nFirst of all, you can miss it because you have taken on someone else‘s burden. All the time you are told to cast your burden on the Lord (1 Pet. 5:7). Any number of people are overflowing with sorrow because they are taking on someone else‘s burden. That is wrong. You must teach them and teach yourself that you have to cast your burdens on the Lord.\n\nSecond, if you do not have peace, you have gotten out of the will of God in some way. You may not have sinned. You can be out of the will of God without sinning. You can be out of the will of God if you are not making progress. If you have not made progress since yesterday morning, you are a backslider. Everybody is a backslider who is not going on with God. You are a backslider if you do not increase in the divine character and likeness of Christ. You have to move from state to state, “from glory to glory”  (2 Cor. 3:18), by the Spirit of the Lord.\n\nYou can lose your peace by missing some divine plan of God, and you can lose your peace because you have gotten your mind on something natural. A natural thing is a carnal thing. The Word of God says that the carnal things have to be destroyed because they are not subject to the law of God and cannot be subject to them (Rom. 8:7). Every carnal thing must be destroyed.\n\nSo you can miss the plan. Now, what is the plan? “You will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on You, because he trusts in You”  (Isa. 26:3). Examine yourself to see where you are. If you are not in perfect peace, you are out of the will of God.\n\nTherefore, if these voices take away your peace, you will know they are not the will of God. But if the Spirit speaks, He will bring harmony and joy. The Spirit always brings three things: comfort, exhortation, and edification. He will make you sing “songs in the night”  (Job 35:10). You will rise in high places, and you will not be afraid of declaring the works of the Lord. When the Spirit of the Lord is upon you and greatly active, you may “go from strength to strength”  (Ps. 84:7), praising the Lord.',        "dailyPrayer": {          "title": 'Thought for today',          "text": 'Nothing makes you so foolish as to turn aside from the Word of God.

The Word of God brings light. I must use it as the Word of Light. I must see it as the Light of Light. I must have it as the Light.\n\nI must be wise, because if I say I am baptized with the Holy Spirit, if I say I am a child of God, I must act so that people will know that I have been with God.

If there is anything I would resound through this meeting like a trumpet, it is this: “Do not let your good be spoken of as evil” (Rom. 14:16)!\n\nWell, what happened to the young woman? The voice came with such tremendous force that she could not let it go. Try the spirits. God will never do anything like that. He will never send you an unreasonable, unmanageable message.\n\nThe moment the girl became obsessed with what the voice said, what did the Devil say next? "You keep this a secret. Don‘t tell anybody. If you confide in anybody, let it be your sister, because she seems to understand you." So they confided in each other.\n\nNow that is surely as satanic as anything you ever heard in your life, because every true thing, every holy thing, does not need to be kept a secret under any circumstances. Anything that is holy can be told on the housetops; God wants you to be able to tell all.\n\nMy wife and I tried to help them. "Oh, God is speaking to me!" the young woman said. And we could not change her. That night she said that the evil power continued speaking, saying to her, "Tell no one but your sister. Go to the station tonight and wait for the train.

Ah, those evil voices. How will we know whether they are of God? When God speaks, He speaks with wisdom. When the Devil came to Jesus he said, “If You are the Son of God”  (Matt. 4:3). The Devil knew that Jesus was the Son of God, and Jesus knew and answered, “It is written, „You shall worship the LORD your God, and Him only you shall serve‟”  (v. 10).\n\nWas there anything wrong with what was happening with these two young women? The wrong was that the first young woman ought to have judged the spirits. If she had asked, "Did Jesus come in the flesh?" the voice would have answered no. No satanic voice in the world and no Spiritualist medium will acknowledge that Jesus came in the flesh.\n\nThe same power said to the young woman, "Now that I know you will obey me in everything, I will make you the greatest missionary in the world." \n\nHow could the two women have known at that moment that this was a false voice? Why, they could have known according to the Word of God. What does it say? “Many false prophets have gone out into the world”  (1 John 4:1). Who are these false prophets after? Perhaps those with sincerity, earnestness, zeal, and purity. \n\nWho knows? These evil powers know. These are the questions they should have kept in their minds: What am I living for? What is the hope of my life? Do I have to be the greatest missionary in the world, or does Jesus need to be glorified in my life to do as He wills with me? The ripe grape is never as pure and perfect as it is just before it decays. The child of God is never as near to God as he is when the Devil can come and say, "You are wonderful!" \n\nIt is satanic to feel that God has a special message for you and that you are someone more special than anyone else. Every place that God brings you to in a rising tide of perfection is a place of humility, brokenness of heart, and fullness of surrender, where only God can rule in authority. It is not where you are somebody, but where God is everything and where you will be living for His glory.\n\nIt took three difficult months before these two young women were delivered from their delusion. But God did deliver them, and later He opened the door for them to go as missionaries to China.\n\nThank God, the Devil‘s plan was defeated, but it was at a tremendous cost, almost of their lives. \n\nHow could they have known that it was a false voice? How can you know? When a voice comes, no matter how it seems to you, you must test it. When it is persistently pressing you to do something and you can hardly conceive how this thing could be possible, you have a position in the power of the Word of God to say to this evil power, "Did Jesus come in the flesh?" (1 John 4:3). And the satanic power will say no. But the Spirit of the living God, the Holy Spirit, always says yes. And so you can get to know the difference. We have to live in the place of knowing the Scriptures and listening to His voice so that we are able to divinely discern whether these things are of God or not. \n\nDid Jesus come in the flesh? Yes, and now the living Christ is within you. Christ came into you the moment you believed. There is a manifestation of it. You may live in such a way that your language, your expressions, your actions, and everything speak of Christ. “They realized that they had been with Jesus”  (Acts 4:13). You can live in such a way that the personality of Christ is exactly what Paul said: "Not I—I don‘t live anymore. Christ lives in me." (See Galatians 2:20.) \n\nThe Christ life, the Christ power, the personality of His presence may be in you in such a way that you cannot doubt the Word of God.',        "dailyPrayer": {          "title": 'Thought for today',          "text": 'The workings of the Spirit are always contrary to the workings of the flesh.'        }      },"12-01": {        "title": 'Do Not Believe Every Spirit',        "note": '',        "passage": 'Scripture reading: 2 Peter 2',        "dailyVerse": {          "ref": 'Romans 12:21',          "text": 'Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.'        },        "body": 'You need the Word of God in your hearts so that you might be able to overcome the world.

It means that we are now in a place where God has set His love upon us. He wants us to listen to what He has to say to us because when His beloved are hearing His voice, then they understand what He has for them.\n\nGod is dealing with us as sons; He calls us “beloved.”  We are in the truth, but we want to know the truth in a way that will keep us free. (See John 8:32.) I want to help the people who have been so troubled with voices and with things that have happened that they have felt they had no control over them. And I want to help those who are bound in many ways and have been trying in every way to get free.\n\nThe fourth chapter of 1 John tells us specifically how to deal with evil powers, with evil voices. It tells us how we may be able to dethrone them and be in a place where we are over them. It shows us how we may live in the world not subject to fear, not subject to bondage, not subject to pain, but in a place where we are defeating evil powers, ruling over them, reigning in the world by this life of Christ. In this way, we will be from above, and we will know it. We will not be subject to the world, but we will reign over the world so that disease, sin, and death will not have dominion.\n\nA keynote that runs through the entire Scriptures is that Jesus has vanquished and overcome all of the powers of the Devil and has destroyed his power, even the power of death. Whether we are going to believe it or not, this is for us. God sends out the challenge, and He says, "If you believe it, it will be so."\n\nWhat will hinder us? Our human nature will. God‘s work in us will be hindered when the human will is not wholly surrendered, when there is some mixture, part spirit and part flesh, when there is a division in your own heart.\n\nIn a house where there are two children, one may desire to obey his father and mother, and he is loved and is very well treated. The other is loved just the same, but the difficulty is this: the wayward boy who wants his own way does many things to grieve his parents, and he gets the whip. They are both children in the house; one is getting the whip, the other is getting the blessing without the whip.\n\nAny number of God‘s children are getting the whip who know better than they are doing. So I want you to wake up to do what you know ought to be done. Sin is never covered by your appearance, your presence, your prayers, or your tears. Sin can only be removed by repentance. When you repent deeply enough, you will find that the thing goes away forever. Never cover up sin. Sins must be judged. Sins must be brought to the blood of Christ.

When the Word of Life is lived out in you because it is your life, then it is enacted, and it brings forth what God has desired.\n\nWhen we quote something from the Scriptures, we must be careful that we are living according to it.

"Young men, you are strong because you know the Word." (See 1 John 2:14.) Where do thoughts of evil come from? They come from the unclean believer, the man who is not entirely sanctified. Remember that the Devil does not know your thoughts; that is where the Devil is held. But God knows your thoughts; God knows all things. Satan can only suggest evil thoughts to try to arouse your carnal nature.\n\nYet if you are disturbed by evil thoughts, if you are troubled or depressed, then you are in a wonderful place. If you never tell anybody about your evil thoughts, and you are not disturbed about them, the carnal powers have never been destroyed in you. But if you tell anybody, then it is proof that you are clean; it is because you are clean that you weep. If you are not disturbed, if you have no conviction, it is because of your uncleansed heart; you have let sin come in.\n\nHow can the believer believe so that he will not be tormented?\n\nHow can we be master of the situation? We must know this Scripture: “Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God”  (1 John 4:2). Did Jesus come in the flesh? Mary produced a Son in the likeness of God. In a similar way, the eternal seed that came into us when we believed produces a life, a person, which is “Christ in [us] ”  (Col. 1:27) and which rises up in us until the reflection of the Son of God is in everything we do. Mary produced a Son for redemption. God‘s seed in us produces a son of perfect redemption, until we live in Him and move by Him, and our whole nature becomes a perfect Son of God in us (Acts 17:28).

For many years after I was baptized, the Lord graciously helped me. I laid hands upon people, and they received the Holy Spirit. I thank God that that power has not stopped. I believe in asking God, in lifting up holy hands and saying, "Father, grant that whoever I place my hands upon will receive the Holy Spirit."\n\nPeople have called me from various places to come and help them when they have had people they wanted to receive the Holy Spirit. Once a group from York, England, sent word saying that they had fourteen people whom they wanted to have baptized in the Holy Spirit, and would I come? They had all been saved since the last time I was there.\n\nSo I went. I have never in all my life met a group of people who were so intoxicated with the Spirit. The power of God was upon them. Right in the midst of them was a young man who had developed such a gift of teaching and leading the people forward with God through the power of the Spirit that they said they did not believe there was another man like him in all of England.\n\nI rejoiced with them over this young man. When Jesus began His ministry, He laid hands upon eleven who turned out to be the most marvelous men, yet they were all younger then He. When Paul was brought into the knowledge of the truth, he was a young man. Jesus began the great ministry of worldwide revival with young life.

They were talking about a certain young man in whom they saw unusual potential to be a great spiritual leader. When that young man spoke in tongues, they almost went wild. They shouted, they wept, they prayed. Oh, they were so excited!\n\nThe leaders said they were overjoyed at the fact of this man‘s baptism. I said, "Be still; the Lord will do His own work."\n\nIn a short time, he was through in the Spirit, and everybody was rejoicing and applauding. They fell into great error there. God has never yet allowed any human being to be applauded for doing the Lord‘s work.\n\nThis young man was in the power of the Holy Spirit, and it was lovely. But they came around him, shaking his hand and saying, "Now we have the greatest teacher there is."\n\nWas this wrong? It was perfectly right, yet it was the worst thing they could have done; they should have been thankful in their hearts. I want to tell you that the Devil never knows your thoughts, and if you won‘t let your thoughts out in public, you will be safe. He can suggest a thought; he can suggest thoughts of evil.\n\nBut that is not sin; all these things are from outside of you. The Devil can suggest evil things for you to receive, but if you are pure, it is like water off a duck‘s back.\n\nOne woman came up and said, "I wouldn‘t be surprised if you were another John the Baptist."\n\nAgain, before we left, this woman came up and said, "Will you believe?

In the middle of the night, he was awakened out of his sleep, and this voice came again: "Rise, get up. You are John the Baptist.

Why, the people, of course.\n\nYou have no right to come around me or anybody else and say, "You are wonderful!" That is satanic. I tell you, we have plenty of the Devil to deal with without your causing a thousand demons to come and help. We need common sense. How could that young man have been delivered?

If there were not a reason, it would not be there. Why did God design it? You must see with me that the gift of tongues was never in evidence before the Holy Spirit came. The old dispensation was very wonderful in prophetic utterances. Every person, whoever he is, who receives the Holy Spirit will have prophetic utterances in the Spirit unto God or in a human language supernaturally coming forth, so that all the people will know that it is the Spirit.\n\nThis is the reason we want all the people filled with the Holy Spirit: they are to be prophetic. When a prophecy is given, it means that God has a thought, a word in season, that has never been in season before—things both new and old. The Holy Spirit brings things to pass!\n\nSo when God fulfilled the promise, when the time was appointed, the Holy Spirit came and filled the apostles. The gift that had never been in operation before came into operation that wonderful day in the Upper Room, and for the first time in all of history, men were speaking in a new order; it was not an old language, but language that was to be interpreted.\n\nThis is profound because we recognize that God is speaking.\n\nNo man understands it. The Spirit is speaking, and the Spirit opens the revelation that they will have, without adulteration.\n\nTongues are a wonderful display of this; they are to revive the people; they are to give new depths of thought.\n\nIf you ever want to know why the Holy Spirit was greatly needed, you will find it in the third chapter of Ephesians. You will be amazed. The language is wonderful. Paul said that he was “the least of all the saints”  (Eph. 3:8), yet God had called him to be a “minister”  (v. 7). His language is wonderful, yet he felt in his heart and life that there was something greater, that the Spirit had him, and he bowed his knees unto the Father (v. 14).\n\nYou cannot find in all the Scriptures words with such profound fruit as those that ring through the verses of Paul‘s remarkable prayer in the Holy Spirit. He prayed “that you may be filled with all the fullness of God”  (Eph. 3:19), and “that you…may be able to comprehend with all the saints”  (vv. 17–18). He prayed that you may be able to ask and think, and think and ask, and that it will not only be abundantly but that it will also be “exceeding abundantly above all that”  you can “ask or think”  (v. 20).

Unless you adhere to this word, every assembly where you are will be broken up, and you will cause trouble. Until you come to a right understanding of the Scriptures, you will never be pleasing to God.\n\nYou have to be very careful that you never use tongues and interpretation in confusion with prophecy. When prophecy is going forth and the truth is being heard and all the people are receiving it with joy and are being built up, then there is no room for tongues or interpretation. But just at the time when the language in my heart seems too big to express, then tongues come forth and God looses the whole thing, and we get a new purpose in that.\n\nSo you who have this wonderful gift of tongues must see to it that you never break in where the Spirit is having perfect right-of-way. But when the Spirit is working with you and you know there is a line of truth that the Lord desires to express, then let the name of God be glorified.\n\nYou see, God wants everything to be in perfect order by the Spirit. That is why Paul said, “If anyone speaks in a tongue, let there be two or at the most three”  (1 Cor. 14:27). You will never find me speaking if three have spoken before me. And you will never find me interpreting any word in tongues if three have spoken already. This is in order to keep the bonds of peace in the body so that the people will not be weary, because there are some people who have known nothing about what is right.\n\nUnless you come to the Word of God, you will be in confusion and you will be in judgment. God does not want you to be in confusion or in judgment, but He wants you to be built up by the Scriptures, for the Scriptures are clear.\n\nIf the Lord reveals truth to me, and if I have said anything previously in relation to this that has not been absolutely scriptural, I will no longer say it. I allow God‘s Word to be my judge. If I find that anything I have said is not scriptural, I repent before God.\n\nAs God is my Judge, I never say anything unless I believe it is the sincere truth.

Why? Because the Scripture says that if, when a prophet is speaking, anything is revealed to someone in the audience, let the first hold his peace and then let that other one speak.\n\nThen the Scripture says, “For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all may be encouraged”  (v. 31). This refers to the one who is preaching. He may be led to hold his peace while one in the midst of the congregation speaks his line of thought that is divinely appointed; then, after he finishes, another may have a prophecy, and he may get up, and so on, until you may have several who have prophesied and you have such revelations in this manner that the whole church is ablaze. I believe that God is going to help us so that we might be sound in mind, right in thought, holy in judgment, separated unto God, and one in the Spirit.\n\nAllow me to say this, and then you judge it afterward. You are not in the right place if you do not judge what I say. You are not to swallow everything I say; you are to judge everything I say by the Scriptures. But you must always use righteous judgment. Righteous judgment is not judging through condemnation, but it is judging something according to the Word of God. In this way, the church may receive edification so that all the people may be built up according to the Word of God. \n\nPerhaps not everyone will affirm what I have to say about this. \nHowever, I truly believe, because God has revealed it to me, that the words “Let there be two or at the most three, each in turn”  (v. 27) mean that often the speaker will not have finished his message after giving the first insight. So often I have seen in an assembly of believers that the first person has spoken and the Spirit of the Lord has been mightily upon him, but the anointing is such that he did not finish his message with his first insight of truth, and he realizes that he is not through with that message. He speaks in the Spirit again, and we feel that the tide is higher. Then he speaks a third time, and the tide is higher still, and then he stops.\n\nThis has led me to believe that “each in turn”  (1 Cor. 14:27) means that one person may be permitted to speak in tongues three times in one meeting. In our conferences in England, we very often have nine utterances in tongues, but there will only be three people speaking. You can have nine, but it is not necessary unless the Lord is prompting it. Sometimes I find that the Spirit will take us through in prophecy in such a way that there will not be more than one, sometimes two people speaking. If I am correct, and I believe I am correct when I say this, when we are full of prophecy, the Spirit has taken our hearts and has moved them by His power. When this happens to me, I speak as fast as I can, but I am not expressing my own thoughts. The Holy Spirit is the thought, the language, and everything; the power of the Spirit is speaking. And when the power of the Holy Spirit is speaking like this, there is no need for tongues or interpretation because you are getting right from the throne the very language of the heart and the man. Then when the person‘s language gives out, the Spirit will speak and the Lord will give tongues and interpretation, and that will lift the whole place.\n\n“At the most three.”  Don‘t say four or five, but three at the most.

It is no good to me if I look good to you. If there were one thing between me and God, I would not dare to speak to others unless I knew that God had made me holy, for they who bear the vessels of the Lord must be holy unto the Lord (Isa. 52:11). And I praise God because I know: \n\nHis blood can make the vilest clean,\nHis blood can make the vilest clean,\nHis blood avails for me,\nHis blood avails for me.\n\nYou cannot assume that someone is still living in the center of God‘s holy will. Because I am only a man, it is possible that I may have grieved the Spirit. If I were to speak in a formal language without unction, that would not move the people. In this type of situation, someone in the place—and this is what tongues are for - someone in the place who is hungry for God and cannot rest because he is not getting the cream of the truth would begin travail-ing and groaning in the Spirit and speaking in tongues.

Their knowledge in the natural realm is so outstanding that many people go to hear their eloquent addresses because the language in them is so beautiful. Yet, through the baptism in the Holy Spirit, God puts you right in the midst of them and says that He has given you the capability to speak like men, with power of thought and language at your disposal, so that you can say anything.\n\nPeople are failing God all the time all over the world because they are taken up with their own eloquence, and God is not in it. They are lost with the pretentiousness of their great authority over language, and they use it on purpose to tickle the ears and the sensations of the people, and it profits nothing. It is nothing. It will wither up, and the people who use it will wither up.\n\nYet God has said there is a way. Now, how would language <i>“of men and of angels”</i>  come to prosper?\n\nWhen you wept through to victory before, you were able to do anything. You were so undone that unless God helped you to do it, you couldn‘t do it. You were so broken in spirit that your whole body seemed to be at an end unless God reinstated you. Then the unction came, and every word was glorifying Jesus. Every sentence lifted the people, and they felt as they listened, "Surely God is in this place! He has sent His Word and healed us." (See Psalm 107:20.) They saw no man there except Jesus. Jesus was so manifested that they all said, "Oh, wasn‘t Jesus speaking to our hearts this morning!"\n\nIf you minister in this way, you will never become nothing. Tongues of men and angels alone will come to nothing. Yet if you speak with tongues of men and angels that are bathed in the love of God until it is to Him alone that you speak, then it will be written down forever in the history of the glory. So let the Lord help us to know how to act in the Holy Spirit.',    "dailyPrayer": {      "title": 'Thought for today',      "text": 'When you are used only for and desire only the glory of God, your acts and life, ministry, and power will be an recorded endlessly in the glory of heaven - for the Acts of the Apostles are being recorded in the glory.'    }},  "12-14": {    "title": 'Prophecy and Goodness',    "note": '',    "passage": 'Scripture reading: <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/114/PSA.31.NKJV?parallel=151">Psalm 31</a>',    "dailyVerse": {      "ref": '1 Corinthians 13:2',      "text": 'And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.'    },    "body": 'Lots of people desire to have faith; many desire to have prophecy; some long to know mysteries. Who knows mysteries? “The secret of the LORD is with those who fear Him” (Ps. 25:14). Don‘t change the Scriptures. “The just shall live by faith”  (Rom. 1:17). Do not alter the Scriptures.\n\nDo not forget that prophecy is beautiful when you understand the principle of it. Prophecy is the sixth gift mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12. What fruit or grace do you think would coincide with prophecy? Why, goodness, of course.\n\nWhy goodness? Because if you are living in holiness, entire sanctification, perfection, you would never take advantage of the Holy Spirit and would speak only as the Spirit gave prophecy. You would never say human things just because you had the gift of prophecy. You would speak according to the Spirit, giving prophecy because you had been holy.\n\nWhen you speak in the natural after you have received the gift of prophecy, it is because you have come to be nothing; you are nothing; you are not counted in the great plan of the great purpose of God. But if you are hidden in Christ and your whole heart is perfected in God, and you will prophesy only when the Spirit of the Lord is upon you, then it will be something that lasts forever. People will be blessed forever and God will be glorified forever.\n\nSuppose that I have all faith so that I could move mountains. Now, suppose that I also have a big farm, but that some of my farmland is not very profitable. It is stony; it has many rocks on it as well as some little mountains that are absolutely untillable and do no good. But because I have faith without love, I say, "I will use my faith and I will move this land. I do not care where it goes as long as my land is clean."\n\nSo I use my faith to clear my land. The next day, my poor next-door neighbor comes and says, "I am in great trouble. All your wasteland and stony, rocky land has been tipped onto mine, and my good land is ruined."\n\nAnd I, who have faith without love, say to him, "You get faith and move it back!"\n\nThat profits nothing. If God brings you into a place of faith, let it be for the glory of God. Then, when you pray, God will wonderfully answer you; nothing will hinder your being used for God, for God delights to use us.\n\nGifts are not only given; they are also increased to those who can be used, who can keep in a place of usefulness. God keeps these yielded ones in a place of being continually supplanted—a new place that is deeper, higher, holier, richer, more heavenly.\n\nIn addition, gifts are not only usable, but God is also glorified in Jesus when you pray the prayer of faith. Jesus Himself said, "When you pray and believe, the Father will be glorified in the Son." (See <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/114/JHN.14.NKJV?parallel=151">John 14:12–13</a>.)',    "dailyPrayer": {      "title": 'Thought for today',      "text": 'It takes a just man to live by faith.'    }},  "12-15": {    "title": 'Sacrifice Is Nothing without Love',    "note": '',    "passage": 'Scripture reading: <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/114/MRK.6.NKJV?parallel=151">Mark 6:30–56</a>',    "dailyVerse": {      "ref": '1 Corinthians 13:3',      "text": 'And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing.'    },    "body": 'Though I can lay my hands on millions of dollars, though I can do all kinds of things with the money, and though, after I have given it all, I show the people more by giving my body to be burned, saying, "I will show what I am made of!" this is nothing, nothing! Five dollars given in the name of the Lord is of more value than thousands without acknowledging Him.\n\nA man came to me, and we had long talks about the Lord. He told me, "I was in a very difficult place. I had been working very hard in the church and had given all my strength…."\n\nOh, I see such godly, holy people doing more than they ought to, thereby giving themselves away. Don‘t you know that your body belongs to God (1 Cor. 6:19–20), and that, if you overtax your body, God says He will judge you for it? We have to be careful because the body that is given to us is to exhibit His power and His glory, and we cannot do this if we give ourselves all the time to work, work, work and think that that is the only way. It is not the way.\n\nThe Scriptures teach us that Jesus had to go and renew His spiritual vision and power in solitude with His Father (Mark 1:35), and it was also necessary for the disciples to draw aside and rest awhile (Mark 6:30–31). Couldn‘t Jesus give them all they needed? My dear brother, whatever God gives you, He will never take away your common sense.\n\nSuppose I unwisely overextended my body and knew that I had done so? How could I ask anyone to pray for me unless I repented? We must be careful. Our bodies are the temples of the Holy Spirit, and He has to dwell in them, and they have to be for His purpose in the world. We are not working for ourselves; God is to be glorified in our bodies. Many today are absolutely withered up, years before their time, because they went beyond their knowledge.',    "dailyPrayer": {      "title": 'Thought for today',      "text": 'Your gifts will perish unless the gifts are used for the glory of Jesus.'    }},  "12-16": {    "title": 'The Gifts',    "note": '',    "passage": 'Scripture reading: Jude',    "dailyVerse": {      "ref": 'Jude 24–25',      "text": 'Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy, to God our Savior, who alone is wise, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and forever.'    },    "body": 'It is very necessary that we receive the Holy Spirit in the first place; after receiving the Holy Spirit, we must earnest-I ly desire the gifts. Then, after receiving the gifts, we must never forget that the gift is entrusted to us for bringing the blessings of God to the people.\n\nFor instance, divine healing is a gift for ministering to the needs of the people. The gift of wisdom is a word in season at the moment of need, to show you just what to do. The gift of knowledge, or the word of knowledge, is to inspire you and to bring you life and joy. This is what God intends.\n\nThen there is the gift of discernment. We are not to discern one another, but to discern evil powers and deal with them and command them back to the pit from which they came. Regarding the gift of miracles, God intends for us to come to the place where we will see miracles worked. God also wants us to understand that tongues are profitable only when they exalt and glorify the Lord. And oh, that we might really know what it means when interpretation is given! It is not merely to have beautiful sensations and think that is interpretation, but it is such that the man who has it does not know what is coming, for if he did, it would not be interpretation. Interpretation is not knowing what you are going to say, but it is being in the place where you say exactly what God says. So when I have to interpret a message, I purposely keep my mind from anything that would hinder, and I sometimes say "Praise the Lord" and "Hallelujah" so that everything will be a word through the Spirit, and not my word, but the word of the Lord!\n\nWe can have these divine gifts so perfectly balanced by divine love that they will be a blessing all the time. However, there is sometimes such a desire in the flesh to do something attention-getting. How the people listen and long for divine prophecy, just as interpretation comes forth! How it thrills! There is nothing wrong with it; it is beautiful. We thank God for the office and the purpose that has caused it to come, but let us be careful to finish when we are through and not continue on our own. That is how prophecy is spoiled. Don‘t fail, beloved, because the people know the difference. They know what is full of life, what is the real thing.\n\nThen again, it is the same with a person praying. We love people to pray in the Holy Spirit; we love to hear them pray even the first sentences because the fire is there. However, what spoils the holiest person in prayer is when, after the spirit of prayer has gone forth, he continues on and people say, "I wish he would stop," and the church becomes silent. They say, "I wish that brother would stop. How beautifully he began; now he is dry!" But he doesn‘t stop.\n\nA preacher was once having a wonderful time, and the people enjoyed it, but when he was through, he continued. A man came and said to someone at the door, "Has he finished?" "Yes," said the man, "long since, but he won‘t stop!" May God save us from that. People know when you are praying in the Spirit. Why should you take time and spoil everything because the natural side has come into it? God never intended that. God has a supernatural side; that is the true side, and how beautiful it is! People sometimes know better than we do, and we would also know if we were more careful.\n\nMay the Lord grant us revelation; we need discernment; we need intuition. It is the life inside. It is salvation inside, cleansing, filling; it is all inside. Revelation is inside. It is for exhibition outside, but always remember that it is inside. God‘s Son said as much when He said, "The pure in heart will see God." (See <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/114/MAT.5.NKJV?parallel=151">Matthew 5:8</a>.) There is an inward sight of God, and it is the pure in heart who see God. Lord, keep us pure so that we will never block the way.',    "dailyPrayer": {      "title": 'Thought for today',      "text": 'If you continue to prophesy on your own, at the end of the anointing, you are using false fire.'    }},  "12-17": {    "title": 'Abide in Christ',    "note": 'I am the vine, you are the branches.

It is wonderful to have the tongue of an angel so that all the people who hear you are moved by your use of language. Yet how I would weep, how my heart would be broken, if I came to speak before you in beautiful language without the power.\n\nIf I had an angel‘s language and the people were all taken with what I said, but Jesus was not glorified at all, it would all be hopeless, barren, and unfruitful. I myself should be nothing. But if I speak and say, "Lord, let them hear Your voice. Lord, let them be compelled to hear Your truth. Lord, anyhow, any way, hide me today," then He becomes glorious, and all the people say, "We have seen Jesus!"\n\nWhen I was in California, I spent many days with our dear Brother Montgomery when I had a chance. During this time, a man wrote to Brother Montgomery. This man had been saved but had lost his joy; he had lost all he had. He wrote, "I am through with everything. I am not going to touch this thing again; I am through." Brother Montgomery wrote back to him and said, "I will never try to persuade you again if you will hear once. There is a man from England, and if you will only hear him once, I will pay all your expenses." So he came. He listened, and at the end of the time he said to me, "This is the truth I am telling you. I have seen the Lord standing beside you, and I heard His voice. I never even saw you.\n\n"I have a lot of money," he continued, "and I have a valley five hundred miles long. If you speak the word to me, I will go on your word, and I will open that valley for the Lord."\n\nI have preached in several of his places, and God has used him wonderfully to speak throughout that valley. What I would have missed when he came the first day, if I had been trying to say something of my own instead of the Lord being there and speaking His words through me! Never let us do anything to lose this divine love, this close affection in our hearts that says, "Not I, but Christ; not I, but Christ!"\n\nLose all your identity in the Son of God. Let Him become all in all. Seek only the Lord, and let Him be glorified. You will have gifts; you will have grace and wisdom. God is waiting for the person who will lay all on the altar, fifty-two weeks in the year, three hundred and sixty-five days in the year, and then continue perpetually in the Holy Spirit.',    "dailyPrayer": {      "title": 'Thought for today',      "text": 'Forget yourself and get lost in Him.'    }},  "12-18": {    "title": 'The Precious Word',    "note": '',    "passage": 'Scripture reading: <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/114/LUK.8.NKJV?parallel=151">Luke 8:4–18</a>',    "dailyVerse": {      "ref": '1 Corinthians 14:12',      "text": 'Even so you, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, let it be for the edification of the church that you seek to excel.'    },    "body": 'This Scripture is the Word of God, and it is most important that when we read the Word, we do so with hearts that have purposed to obey its every precept.

I believe we are in order to consider further a subject that we greatly need to be informed about in these days. So many people are receiving the baptism of the Holy Spirit, but then they do not know which way to go.\n\nWe have a great need today. It is that we may be supplied with revelation according to the mind of the Lord, that we may be instructed by the mind of the Spirit, that we may be able to rightly divide the Word of Truth (<a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/114/2TI.2.NKJV?parallel=151">2 Tim. 2:15</a>), and that we may not be novices, considering the fact that the Spirit of the Lord has come to us in revelation. We ought to be alert to every touch of divine, spiritual illumination.\n\nWe should carefully consider what the apostle Paul said to us: <i>“Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption”</i>  (Eph. 4:30). The sealing of the Spirit is very remarkable, and I pray to God that not one of you may lose the divine inheritance that God has chosen for you, which is greater than you could choose if your mind had ten times its normal faculties. God‘s mind is greater than yours. His thoughts are higher than the heavens over you (Isa. 55:9), so that you do not need to be afraid.',    "dailyPrayer": {      "title": 'Thought for today',      "text": 'When the Word is in your heart, it will preserve you from desiring sin.'    }},  "12-19": {    "title": 'Worthy Conduct',    "note": '',    "passage": 'Scripture reading: <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/114/PHP.1.NKJV">Philippians 1</a>',    "dailyVerse": {      "ref": 'Philippians 1:6 ',      "text": 'Being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ.'    },    "body": 'I have great love for my sons and my daughter, but it is nothing in comparison to God‘s love toward us. God‘s love wants us to walk up and down the earth as His Son did: clothed, filled, radiant, with fire beaming forth from our countenances, setting forth the power of the Spirit so that the people jump into liberty.\n\nBut there is deplorable ignorance among those who have gifts. It is not right for you to think that because you have a gift, you are to wave it before the people and try to get their minds upon that, because, if you do, you will be out of the will of God. Gifts and callings in the body of Christ may be irrevocable (Rom. 11:29), but remember that God calls you to account for properly administering the gift in a spiritual way after you have received it. It is not given to adorn you, but to sustain, build, edify, and bless the church. When God ministers through a member of the body of Christ and the church receives this edification, then all the members will rejoice together. God moves upon us as His offspring, as His choice, and as the fruit of the earth. He wants us to be elegantly clothed in wonderful raiment, even as our Master is.\n\nHis workings upon us may be painful, but the wise saint will remember that among those whom God chastens, it is the one who is trained by that chastening to whom “it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness”  (Heb. 12:11). Therefore, let Him do with you what seems good to Him, for He has His hand upon you; He will not willingly take it off until He has performed the thing He knows you need. So if He comes to sift you, be ready for the sifting. If He comes with chastisement, be ready for chastisement. If He comes with correction, be ready for correction. Whatever He wills, let Him do it, and He will bring you to the land of plenty. Oh, it is worth the world to be under the power of the Holy Spirit! \n\nIf He does not chasten you, if you sail placidly along without incident, without crosses, without persecutions, without trials, remember that “if you are without chastening, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate and not sons”  (Heb. 12:8). Therefore, “examine yourselves as to whether you are in the faith”  (2 Cor. 13:5). Never forget that Jesus said this word: "They who hear My voice follow Me."

Your whole body may be put to-T gether in such a way that one particular gift would not suit you at all, while it would suit another person.\n\nSo the Word of God deals here with varieties of gifts, meaning that these gifts perfectly meet the condition of each believer. That is God‘s plan. It may be that not one person would be led to claim all the gifts. Nevertheless, do not be afraid; the Scriptures are definite. Paul said that you do not need to come short in any gift (1 Cor. 1:7). God has wonderful things for you beyond what you have ever known. The Holy Spirit is so full of prophetic operations of divine power that it is marvelous what may happen after the Holy Spirit comes.\n\nHow He loosed me! I am no good without the Holy Spirit. The power of the Holy Spirit loosed my language. I was like my mother. She had no ability to speak. If she began to tell a story, she couldn‘t finish it. My father would say, "Mother, you will have to begin again." I was like that. I couldn‘t tell a story. I was bound. I had plenty of thoughts, but no language. But oh, after the Holy Spirit came!\n\nWhen He came, I had a great desire for gifts. So the Lord caused me to see that it is possible for every believer to live in such holy anointing, such divine communion, such pressed-down measure (Luke 6:38) by the power of the Spirit, that every gift can be his.\n\nBut is there not a vast and appalling unconcern about possessing the gifts? You may ask a score of believers, chosen at random from almost any church, "Do you have any of the gifts of the Spirit?" The answer from all will be, "No," and it will be given in a tone and with a manner that conveys the thought that the believer is not surprised that he does not have the gifts, that he doesn‘t expect to have any of them, and that he does not expect to seek them.\n\nIsn‘t this terrible, when the living Word specifically exhorts us to “earnestly desire the best gifts”  (1 Cor. 12:31)?\n\nSo in order that the gifts might be everything and in evidence, we have to see that we cease to live without His glory. He works with us, and we work with Him—cooperating, working together. This is divine. Surely this is God‘s plan.\n\nGod has brought you to the banquet, and He wants to send you away full. We are in a place where God wants to give us visions. We are in a place where, in His great love, He is bending over us with kisses. Oh, how lovely is the kiss of Jesus, the expression of His love!\n\nOh, come, let us seek Him for the best gifts, and let us strive to be wise and to rightly divide the Word of Truth (2 Tim. 2:15), giving it forth in power so that the church may be edified and sinners may be saved.',    "dailyPrayer": {      "title": 'Thought for today',      "text": 'Look to the Holy Spirit to show you how to use the gifts so that you never use them without the power of the Spirit.'    }},  "12-21": {    "title": 'Transformed by God',    "note": 'Behold, I will do a new thing.',    "passage": 'Scripture reading: Titus 3',    "dailyVerse": {      "ref": 'Isaiah 43:19',      "text": 'Behold, I will do a new thing.'    },    "body": 'hank God for His Word.

God‘s Word is like a sword piercing through. The Word is divinely appointed for us. Take it in; think it out; work it out. It is the truth.\n\nWhen I was going to New Zealand and Australia, there were many there to see me off. An Indian doctor rode in the same car with me to the docks and boarded the same ship. He was very quiet and took in all the things that were said on the ship. I began to preach, of course, and the Lord began to work among the people. In the second class of the ship, there was a young man and his wife who were attendants for a lady and gentleman in the first class. And as these two young people heard me talking to them privately and otherwise, they were very much impressed. Then the lady they were attending got very sick. In her sickness and her loneliness, she could find no relief. They called in the doctor, and the doctor gave her no hope.\n\nAnd then, when in this strange dilemma—she was a great Christian Scientist, a preacher of it, and had gone many places preaching it—they thought of me. Knowing the conditions, and what she lived for, knowing that it was late in the day, that in the condition of her mind she could only receive the simplest word, I said to her, "Now you are very sick, and I won‘t talk to you about anything except this: I will pray for you in the name of Jesus, and the moment I pray you will be healed."\n\nAnd the moment I prayed she was healed. That was “like precious faith”  (2 Pet. 1:1) in operation. Then she was disturbed. I showed her the terrible state she was in and pointed out to her all 540\n\nher folly and the fallacy of her position. I showed her that there was nothing in Christian Science, that it is a lie from the beginning and one of the last agencies of hell. At best it is a lie: preaching a lie and producing a lie.\n\nThen she came to her senses. She became so penitent and brokenhearted. But the thing that stirred her first was that she had to go preach the simple gospel of Christ where she had preached Christian Science. She asked me if she had to give up certain things. I won‘t mention the things; they are too vile. I said, "No, what you have to do is to see Jesus and take Jesus." When she saw the Lord in His purity, the other things had to go. At the presence of Jesus, all else goes.\n\nThis opened the door. I had to preach to all on the boat. This gave me a great chance. As I preached, the power of God fell, conviction came, and sinners were saved. They followed me into my cabin one after another. God was working there.\n\nThen this Indian doctor came. He said, "What will I do? Your preaching has changed me, but I must have a foundation. Will you spend some time with me?"\n\n"Of course I will."\n\nThen we went alone, and God broke the fallow ground. This Indian doctor was going right back home but as a new man. He had left a practice there. He told me of the great practice he had.

We must have very thirsty conditions and hungry souls. Then we can have what is prepared for us. We can be “strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man” (Eph. 3:16).

It is an addition sum to meet every need, to display God‘s power, and to enlarge one‘s faith.\n\nWhat does Paul mean by the width of Christ‘s love? It is recognizing that God is sufficient in every circumstance. The length of His love indicates that God is in everything. God is in the depths and the heights! God is always lifting you, and the truth in this verse is enough for anyone in any circumstance to triumph. He “is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we can ask or think,”  not according to the mind of Paul, but “according to the power that works in us”  (v. 20). Simplicity of heart can broaden one‘s perspective, but this fullness is an ideal power of God in the human soul, enlarging every part. God is there instead of you to make you full, and you are full as your faith reaches out to be filled with all the fullness of God.\n\nThe power of the Lord was present to heal. His fullness of power flowed out of the disciples to others. In Acts 1, we see the power of God revealed as Jesus was lifted up to where He was before—into the presence of God. Jesus Christ showed the power of God in human flesh. The fullness of the Godhead was bodily manifested in Jesus (Col. 2:9). John said that “in Him was life, and the life was the light of men”  (John 1:4). His substance revealed the fullness of God. How can it be fulfilled in you? The Scripture provides the answer: He is “able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we can ask or think”  (Eph. 3:20). It is filled there in the glory. But it‘s a tremendous thing. God will have to do something.\n\nBeloved, it is not according to your mind at all but according to the mind of God, according to the revelation of the Spirit. “Above all that we can ask or think.”  The blood has been poured out.\n\nTruly, we are not worthy, but He is worthy. He will do more than we can even ask. How can it be possible? God puts it in your heart. He can do it. We hear much about rates of interest, but if you will faithfully follow God, He will add, enlarge, and lift you all the time, adding compound interest. Five percent? No! A thousand percent, a million percent! If you are willing, if holiness is the purpose of your heart, it will be done, for God is in His place. Will you be in the plan “according to the power that works in [you] ”  (Eph. 3:20)? Whatever you are at any time, it will be by His effective power, lifting, controlling, and carrying you in constant rest and peace; it is “according to the power that works in [you] .”  Let everyone say: “To Him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen”  (v. 21).',    "dailyPrayer": {      "title": 'Thought for today',      "text": 'Many people receive no blessing because they did not thank God for the last blessing.'    }},  "12-24": {    "title": 'Abundant Blessings',    "note": 'When we were still without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.',    "passage": 'Scripture reading: Romans 5',    "dailyVerse": {      "ref": 'Romans 5:6',      "text": 'When we were still without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.'    },    "body": 'hrough one man‘s disobedience, through one man‘s sin, death came and reigned.

Romans 5 is a real divine healing chapter; it is a real ascension chapter; it is a powerful resurrection chapter. It looses you from your limitations. It moves you from your former place into a place of coveted grace. It takes your weaknesses and sins and abounds to you with atonement. It reveals to you all that Adam ever had that bound you. It reveals all that Christ ever had or will have that abounds toward you to liberate you from all that is human and bring you into all that is divine. This is the glorious liberty of the Gospel of Christ:\n\nAnd the gift is not like that which came through the one who sinned. For the judgment which came from one offense resulted in condemnation, but the free gift which came from many offenses resulted in justification. (Rom. 5:16)\n\nWe have been condemned and lost. How human nature destroys! We all know sin had its reign, but there is justification. God works in the lower order with His mighty higher order. He touches human weaknesses with His touch of infinite, glorious resurrection power. He transforms you:\n\nFor if by the one man‟s offense death reigned through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ. (Rom. 5:17) How rich we are. The death-life has been replaced. Now there is a righteous life. You were in death and it was the death-life, but now you have received the righteous life. How much have you ac-quired of it? Have you received an “abundance of grace”?  Your grace has run out years ago. My grace has been depleted years ago, but I realized by the revelation of the Spirit that His grace should take the place of my grace. His power should cover me where I cannot cover myself. He stands beside me when I am sure to go down. Where sin abounded, grace abounded, and His love abounded. He stretched out His hand in mercy; He never failed. He was there every time when I was sure to go down. Grace abounded. Oh, the mercy, the boundless mercy of the love of God to us!\n\nI hope you are getting it, thriving in it, and triumphing in it.

The Word is His voice, and as we get nearer to Jesus, we understand that He came to take out for Himself a people who would be His bride. It means not only to be saved, but also that there is an eternal destiny awaiting us in glory. God in His mercy has given us this blessed revelation of how He lived, loved, and had power to say to those disciples, "Some of you shall not see death until you see the kingdom of God coming in power." (See Mark 9:1.)\n\nOh, that blessed Christ, who could pray until His countenance was changed and became so glorious, until His raiment became white and glistening. He said, “I have power to lay [My life]  down, and I have power to take it again”  (John 10:18). It is true that by wicked hands He was taken and crucified, but He had to be willing, for He had all power and could have called on legions of angels to deliver Him from death. But oh, that blessed Christ had purposed to save us and bring us into fellowship and oneness with Himself. He went right through death so that He might impart to us the blessed reconciliation between God and man.\n\nSo it is that the Man Jesus Christ, who is the Atonement for the whole world, who is the Son of God, is also the sinner‘s Friend. “He was wounded for our transgressions”  (Isa. 53:5). This blessed Christ gave His disciples the glory that He had with the Father before the world was. (See John 17:5.) God wants us to know that He will withhold “no good thing…from those who walk uprightly”  (Ps. 84:11), including health, peace, joy in the Holy Spirit, and a life in Christ Jesus.',    "dailyPrayer": {      "title": 'Thought for today',      "text": 'We must be ready for our King.'    }},  "12-27": {    "title": 'Our Helper',    "note": 'No one can say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit.',    "passage": 'Scripture reading: <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/114/JHN.14.NKJV?parallel=151">John 14:16–31</a>',    "dailyVerse": {      "ref": '1 Corinthians 12:3',      "text": 'No one can say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit.'    },    "body": 'The Holy Spirit has a royal plan, a heavenly plan.

He was moved by the Spirit and led by the Spirit. We read of some who heard the Word but did not benefit from it, because faith was lacking in them (Rom. 9:6–8). We must have a living faith in God‘s Word, a faith that is quickened by the Spirit.\n\nA man may be saved and still have a human spirit. In many people who hear about the baptism of the Holy Spirit, the human spirit immediately arises against the Holy Spirit. The human spirit is not subject to the law of God, nor can it be. (See Romans 8:7.) The disciples at one time wanted to call down fire from heaven, and Jesus said to them, “You do not know what manner of spirit you are of”  (Luke 9:55). The human spirit is not subject to the law of God.\n\nThe Holy Spirit came forth for one purpose: to reveal Jesus to us. Jesus  “made Himself of no reputation”  (Phil. 2:7), and He was obedient unto death (v. 8), that God should forever hold Him up as a token of submissive yieldedness. God highly exalted Him and gave Him a name above every name. “Now He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who also has given us the Spirit as a guarantee”  (2 Cor. 5:5). With the clothing upon of the Spirit, human depravity is covered, and everything that is contrary to the mind of God is destroyed. God must have bodies for Himself, perfectly prepared by the Holy Spirit, for the Day of the Lord. “For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven”  (v. 2).\n\nWas Paul speaking here about the coming of the Lord? No! Yet this condition of preparedness is highly relevant. The Holy Spirit is coming to take back a church and a perfect bride. The Holy Spirit must find in us perfect yieldedness, with every human desire subjected to Him. “No one can say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit”  (1 Cor. 12:3). He has come to reveal Christ in us, so that the 549\n\nglorious flow of the life of God may bring rivers of living water to the thirsty land within.\n\nThe Spirit has to breathe into us a new occupancy, a new order. The Holy Spirit came to give the vision of a life in which Jesus is perfected. It is Christ “who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace”  (2 Tim. 1:9).\n\nWe who are saved have been called with a holy calling, called to be saints—to be pure, holy, and Godlike; to be sons with power. It is a long time now since it was settled and death was abolished. Death has no more power. This was made known through the Gospel, which brought in immortality. Mortality is a hindrance. Sin has no more dominion over you. You reign in Christ, and you make rightful use of His finished work. Don‘t groan and travail for a week. If you are in need, “only believe”  (Mark 5:36). Don‘t fast to get some special thing, “only believe.”  It is according to your faith that God blesses you with more faith. “Have faith in God” (Mark 11:22). If you are free in God, believe! Believe, and it will be unto you even as you believe. (See Matthew 9:29.)\n\n“Awake, you who sleep” (Eph. 5:14); put on light, and open your eyes. “If then you were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God” (Col. 3:1). Stir yourselves up, beloved! Where are you? I am risen with Christ, planted in Him. It was a beautiful planting. I am seated with Him. God gives me the credit, and I believe Him. Why should I doubt?\n\nDare to believe until the life of Jesus is implanted within your soul. “The righteous will hold to his way”  (Job 17:9).

The material things did not count for much after the night of revelation. Who brought about the change? God did.\n\nCan you hold on to God as Jacob did? You certainly can if you are sincere, dependent, broken, and weak. It is when you are weak that you are strong. But if you are self-righteous, if you are proud, if you are high-minded, if you are puffed up in your own mind, you can receive nothing from Him. If you become lukewarm instead of being on fire for God, you can become a disappointment to Him. And He says, “I will vomit you out of My mouth”  (Rev. 3:16).\n\nBut there is a place of holiness, a place of meekness, a place of faith, where you can call to God,  “I will not let You go unless You bless me!”  (Gen. 32:26). And in response, He will bless you “exceedingly abundantly above all that [you]  ask or think”  (Eph. 3:20).\n\nSometimes we are tempted to think that He has left us. Oh, no. He has promised never to leave us or forsake us (Deut. 31:6). He had promised not to leave Jacob, and He did not break His promise. He has promised not to leave us, and He will not fail. Jacob held on until the blessing came. We can do the same.\n\nIf God does not help us, we are no good for this world‘s need; we are no longer salt, we lose our savor.

There is no definite cry or prayer within the soul that is making people stop and cry out for God and the coming of the Son.\n\nI am intensely eager that by some means I may inspire you to see what the Spirit has for you. Life in Christ is absolutely different from death. Life is what people long for because of its possibilities; death is what people draw back from because of its finality. God has designed for us to live in freedom from the law of sin and death.\n\nThis truth is from the divine mind of the Master. He said that He who lives for himself will die. He who seeks to live will die, but he who is willing to die will live (Luke 17:33). God wants us to see that there is a life that is contrary to this life.\n\nThe Spirit of the Lord reveals the following to us in the Word of God: “He who believes in the Son has everlasting life; and he who does not believe the Son shall not see life”  (John 3:36). The unbelieving person is living and walking about but not seeing life. There is a life that is always brought into condemnation, which is living in death. There is a life that is free from condemnation—living in the Life.\n\nThe plan of God‘s Son for us is to be so much greater in this world than we have ever comprehended. God‘s plan is not for me to stay where I was yesterday. He desires that spiritual revelation will bring me into touch with divine harmony. God wants me to reach for something more. My eyes are looking up; my heart is looking up. My heart is big and enlarged in the presence of God, for I want to hear one word from God: "Come up higher." God will give us 553\n\nthat—the privilege of going higher into a holy relationship with Him.\n\nThe person who is under no condemnation has the heavens opened above him. This person has the smile of God upon him. This person has come into the realm of faith and joy and knows that his prayers are answered. God the Holy Spirit would have us to understand that there is a place in the Holy Spirit where there is no condemnation. This place is holiness, purity, righteousness, higher ground, perfection, and being more perfected in the presence of God. This higher ground is perfection, where God is bringing us to live in such a way that He may smile through us and act upon us until our bodies become a flame of light ignited by Omnipotence. This is God‘s plan for us in the inheritance; this divine place is for us today.\n\nThere is no condemnation. God wants us to see our covering, that blessed assurance of being strengthened, that knowledge of the Rock of Ages cleft for me, that place where I know I am! And that joy unbounding where I know there are neither devils nor angels nor principalities nor powers to interfere with that life in Christ (Rom. 8:38–39)! It is wonderful!\n\n“No weapon formed against you shall prosper” (Isa. 54:17). The power of the Most High God has put us in Christ. If we had put ourselves in, it would have been different. We were in the world, but God took us out of the world and put us into Christ. God today by His Spirit wants us to see how this regenerative power, this glorious principle of God‘s high thoughtfulness, is for us. God wants us to lose ourselves in His sweetness. There is a glorious power behind us when God is behind us; there is a wonderful going before when He goes before us. He said, "I will go before you, and I will be your rear guard." (See Isaiah 52:12.)

All things are possible, even the fulfilling of all promises is possible, to him who believes (Mark 9:23).\n\nThere will be failure in our lives if we do not build on the base, the Rock Christ Jesus. He is the only way; He is the truth; He is the life (John 14:6). And the Word He gives us is life-giving. As we receive the Word of Life, it quickens, it opens, it fills us, it moves us, it changes us, and it brings us into a place where we dare to say amen to all that God has said. Beloved, there is a lot in an amen. You never get any place until you have the amen inside of you. That was the difference between Zacharias and Mary. When the Word came to Zacharias, he was filled with unbelief until the angel said, “You will be mute…because you did not believe my words” (Luke 1:20). Mary said, “Let it be to me according to your word”  (v. 38). The Lord was pleased that she believed what He had spoken. When we believe what God has said, there will be results.\n\nWe may do much praying and groaning, but we do not receive from God because of that; we receive because we believe. Yet sometimes it takes God a long time to bring us through the groaning and the crying before we can believe.\n\nI know that no man by his praying can change God, for you cannot change Him. Charles Finney said, "Can a man who is full of sin and all kinds of ruin in his life change God when he starts to pray?" No, it is impossible. But when a man labors in prayer, he groans and travails because his tremendous sin is weighing him down, and he becomes broken in the presence of God. When properly 555\n\nmelted, he comes into perfect harmony with the divine plan of God, and then God can work in that clay. He could not before. Prayer changes hearts, but it never changes God. He is the same yesterday, and today, and forever: full of love, full of compassion, full of mercy, full of grace, and ready to bestow this and communicate that to us as we come to Him in faith.\n\nBelieve that when you come into the presence of God you can have all you came for. You can take it away, and you can use it, for all the power of God is at your disposal in response to your faith. The price for all was paid by the blood of Jesus Christ at Calvary. Oh, He is the living God, the One who has power to change us! “It is He who has made us, and not we ourselves”  (Ps. 100:3).

Sugarcoating won‘t do. We must have reality, the real working of our God. We must know God. We must be able to go in and converse with God. We must also know the mind of God toward us, so that all our petitions are always in line with His will.\n\nAs this “like precious faith”  (2 Peter 1:1) becomes a part of you, it will make you so that you will dare to do anything. And remember, God wants daring followers who will be strong in Him and dare to do exploits. How will we reach this place of faith? Let go of your own thoughts, and take the thoughts of God, the Word of God. If you build yourself on imaginations, you will go wrong. You have the Word of God, and it is enough.\n\nA man gave this remarkable testimony concerning the Word of God: "Never compare this Book with other books. Never think or say that this Book contains the Word of God. It is the Word of God. It is supernatural in origin, eternal in duration, inexpressible in value, infinite in scope, regenerative in power, infallible in authority, universal in interest, personal in application, inspired in totality.\n\nRead it through. Write it down. Pray it in. Work it out. And then pass it on."\n\nTruly the Word of God changes a person until he becomes “an epistle of Christ”  (2 Cor. 3:3). It transforms his mind, changes his character, moves him on from grace to grace, makes him an inheri-tor of the very nature of God. God comes in, dwells in, walks in, talks through, and dines with him who opens his being to the Word of God and receives the Spirit who inspired it.\n\nIf you have lost your hunger for God, if you do not have a cry for more of God, you are missing the plan. A cry must come up from us that cannot be satisfied with anything but God. He wants to give us the vision of the prize ahead that is something higher than we have ever attained. If you ever stop at any point, pick up at the place where you have left off, and begin again under the refining light and power of heaven. God will meet you. And while He will bring you to a consciousness of your own frailty and to a brokenness of spirit, your faith will lay hold of Him and all the divine resources. His light and compassion will be manifested through you, and He will send the rain.\n\nShould we not dedicate ourselves afresh to God? Some say, "I dedicated myself last night to God." Every new revelation brings a new decision. Let us seek Him.',    "dailyPrayer": {      "title": 'Thought for today',      "text": 'Do not let one thought, one action, one thing in any way interfere with the Rapture.

The Greek word translated “bond-servant”  literally means “slave.” So, we see that Jesus, who was Lord of all, emptied Himself and was willing to become a bondservant, a slave. We must imitate His attitude.\nPaul penned a beautiful, parallel passage in Galatians:\n<i>For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh [do not gratify your own fleshly, selfish desires] , but through love serve one another.\nFor the whole Law is fulfilled in one word, in the statement, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”</i> (Galatians 5:13–14 nasb)\nLooking outward at others is the way in which we free ourselves from indulging in our fleshly natures or yielding to selfishness. We are to serve one another in love. I believe that the Holy Spirit is emphasizing this loving, selfless attitude to God’s people today. Many people talk about serving the Lord but never serve their fellow believers.

By his background, Paul was a strict, observant, orthodox Jew. He was a Pharisee, and he had the qualifications to be a rabbi. His was the kind of righteousness that caused him to separate himself from other people, whom he regarded on a lower level or even despised.\nBut when he came to know Jesus, the most wonderful change took place in his nature. Bear in mind that the people of Corinth were basically the scum of the earth. In this epistle, Paul said that some of them had been homosexuals, some prostitutes, some drunkards, and some revilers. They were just not the best kind of people. Corinth was one of the major seaports of the ancient world, and, like many seaports, the city was filled with these sorts of people.\nBut let’s look at this astonishing statement of Paul: <i>“For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your bondservants for Jesus’ sake”</i> (2 Corinthians 4:5 nasb).\nHere is this proud Pharisee saying, “We are your slaves for the sake of Jesus”—even to the likes of the people of Corinth!\nNotice the three steps. First, dethrone self:  <i>“not...ourselves.”</i> Second, enthrone Christ: <i>“Christ Jesus as Lord.”</i>  Third, serve others:“[we are]  <i>your bond-servants for Jesus’ sake.”</i>  Those three steps are so important. By love, serve others. That’s the message: escape from self-centeredness.',        "dailyPrayer": {          "title": 'Prayer',          "text": 'Thank You, Lord, that You help me to love others.

It is not something that just happens, and it is certainly not ours by nature. For example, a server in a restaurant is a person who, in a sense, is called to serve. But a server needs to be trained. I have a friend who used to be a server, and he once explained to me all that is involved in being a <i>good</i> server.\nOnce I understood the training process, I realised that it does not just happen; serving is a skill we have to acquire. We have to study others to find out what produces a positive response, not a negative one. We are to study others to provoke them to love and good deeds, not to the opposite. Serving requires practice, training, and discipline. \nServing also requires the right environment. After saying, <i>“Let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds”</i> (Hebrews 10:24 nasb), the writer of Hebrews went on to say, <i>“Not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more, as you see the day drawing near”</i> (verse 25 nasb). We must learn to serve in the right environment, which is expressed in the words <i>“our own assembling together.”</i>  It means close, committed, regular fellowship.\n In the next verse, the writer presented the disastrous alternative. Immediately after he warned us not to forsake our own assembling together, he said, <i>“For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a certain terrifying expectation of judgment”</i> (verses 26–27 nasb). The implication is that if we do not stay in the right environment—if we are not in close, committed, regular fellowship—we will go back to sinning.\nThe only safe way is to stay in fellowship, consider other people, and learn to serve them joyfully.',        "dailyPrayer": {          "title": 'Prayer',          "text": 'Thank You, Lord, that You help me to love others.

We consider Jesus first; then, we consider one another. It makes a great deal of difference whether I relate to you as just a person or as a person in Christ.\nMy mind goes back to an incident that happened while I was the principal of a college that trained teachers in East Africa. For every vacancy that allowed us to accept one student, there were at least ten suitable applicants. One girl actually walked twenty-four miles barefoot just to get an interview. You can hardly conceive the desperate hunger people in Africa had for getting an education. Education was the key to success in life, as they saw it.\nOne day, an elderly mother came to me on behalf of her son, a prospective student. He was not exactly suitable for the school, however, and we had not accepted him. His mother was pestering me to the point that I was growing annoyed with her. In Africa, they do not believe in democracy; they believe in the chief, the strong man. He is the one who matters. This woman kept telling me, “You are the great one; what you say goes.” I got so irritated that I was about to give her a piece of my mind—and it was not my sanctified mind, either! That is when the Lord spoke to me, very gently, saying, "Remember, she’s one of My children. Be careful how you treat her." I repented. She really was a dear, precious woman, and a child of God.

I think it was used deliberately in order to make us think.\nWhat do we usually provoke from other people? Anger or jealousy. But we are to provoke to <i>“love and to good works.”</i>\nThe Greek word translated <i>“provoke”</i>  is the same word from which the English word <i>paroxysm</i> is derived. Do you know what a paroxysm is? It is an absolutely uncontrollable outburst of emotion, such as anger, or even laughter.\nAlthough the word <i>provoke</i>  often suggests something bad, in this context, it is turned to the good, for we are to provoke one another to love and good works. And let me just point out that there are certain people whom you’ll <i>have</i>  to provoke if you want them to do the right thing. Moreover, you will have to consider <i>how</i> to provoke them.\nThis is one of my weaknesses. I don’t like having to consider people’s personalities. With a military background and a rather logical mind, it is sufficient for me just to tell the person to do something. But the Bible tells us to consider <i>how</i> to tell them, because if you want the right result from one person, you have to tell him in quite a different way from the way in which you might tell another person. Anybody who has children knows this is true—you cannot treat them all the same. You can scold one child and get the right result.

We may find ourselves side-by-side with unbelievers every day—in our homes, in our workplaces, or in other activities of daily life. In such situations, our Christian testimony requires us to be friendly, courteous, and helpful. But we are not free to share with unbelievers that which is morally or spiritually impure or dishonoring to Christ. In this realm, we must follow Paul’s exhortation in 2 Corinthians 6:17: <i>“Do not touch what is unclean.”</i>  If we are sensitive to the Holy Spirit, He will always warn us of these defiling contacts and show us how to protect ourselves from them.\nHowever, the surest protection against wrong fellowship is right fellowship. As God’s children, we are heirs to innumerable joys and blessings of which the world knows nothing. In fact, Paul told us that our Father God <i>“has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ”</i> (Ephesians 1:3).

But it just so happens that, in the original Greek, the first phrase, <i>“let us...lay aside every encumbrance,”</i>  is not found in that form. Instead, it is a participle that reads like this: “Laying aside every encumbrance, let us run with endurance the race.” The real “let us” phrase in the above verse, on which we will need to focus, is <i>“Let us run with endurance the race that is set before us.”</i>\nHere and elsewhere in the New Testament, the Christian life is compared to a race. This analogy implies a specific course marked out before us in advance. Success in the Christian life consists in completing the course in accordance with the rules of the competition.\nIn light of the fact that we are confronted with this race that is set before us, we need to see that there are four requirements for successfully completing the race. Each one of these requirements is found in the New Testament: (1) the right mental attitude, (2) self-control, (3) endurance, and (4) having our eyes fixed on Jesus.

This truth was exemplified by the words of Paul as he spoke about his relationship to Jesus Christ: <i>“That I may know Him, and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death; in order that I may attain to the resurrection from the dead”</i> (Philippians 3:10–11 nasb).\nPaul had a specific objective. He did not run aimlessly. (See 1 Corinthians 9:26.) He had an aim before him. He knew what the goal was, which determined his mental attitude. He continued, <i>“Not that I have already obtained it, or have already become perfect</i> [complete], <i>but I press on in order that I may lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus”</i> (verse 12 nasb). Paul’s vision was that Christ had laid hold of him for a purpose; fulfilling that purpose meant that he would have to relate to this purpose. He had to be determined that the purpose of Christ would become his purpose.\n<i>Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.</i> (verses 13–14 nasb)\nThe phrase <i>“I press on”</i>  occurs twice, once in verse 12 and once in verse 14. That is the mental attitude we need to share with Paul: <i>“I press on. I have a goal. I have not yet arrived, but I know where I’m headed.”</i>\nThe last time Paul used that phrase, he said, “I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.”  There is a reward for those who successfully complete the race.

The same principle still applies.<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but only one receives the prize?

This truth is so obvious when we think in terms of athletics. Every athlete who succeeds as an athlete today has to exercise the most rigorous self-control. He has to go into training—controlling what he eats, how much sleep he gets, and the amount of exercise he has. He also has to control his psychology, building up the right kind of attitude. He cannot afford to give way to negative thoughts. He has to go into the competition with a positive attitude, believing he is going to achieve victory.\nAll this is equally true for us as Christians in our race.

We must cultivate endurance.\nWhat is the opposite of endurance? I think it is giving up, or quitting. Christians cannot afford to be quitters. When God commits us to something, we have to set our faces to fulfill it and go through with it. There is a close relationship between self-control and endurance.\nWithout self-control, we will not achieve endurance. We must master our weaknesses; otherwise, every time we are tested in the area of endurance, some weakness—whether it is emotional, psychological, or physical—will get us down, and we will give up at the very point where we should have been holding on and enduring.\nYet another condition for a successful race is to have our eyes fixed on Jesus. As is stated in Hebrews, <i>“Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross”</i> (Hebrews 12:2 nasb).\nWe have to look continually to Jesus. In other words, we cannot run the race in self-reliance. Looking to Jesus means that He is our example, and we put our confidence in Him. He is the author - the beginning of our faith.

Remember, this is not a short sprint - it is a long, deliberate race.\nThe primary characteristic that is required is endurance. Many people start off the Christian life as if it were a dash. A little while later, they are panting beside the track; they are finished, and they have hardly begun the race.

The <i>New American Standard Bible</i> says, <i>“Tribulation brings about perseverance; and perseverance, proven character; and proven character, hope.”</i>  Perseverance produces  <i>proven</i>  character in us. This is the heart of endurance—character that has stood the test. As Paul wrote, <i>“Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us”</i> (Romans 5:5).\nLove is a matter of character. In essence, we are dealing with the formation of our characters. We rejoice in tribulation, for tribulation is the only thing that produces perseverance. And perseverance produces proven character. I know men with whom I have walked and shared hardship, opposition, misrepresentation, and misunderstanding. But today, for me, their character is proven; I know I can trust them.

Some people will tell you that faith is all you need to claim God’s promise. But that is not true. You need faith and endurance. It takes both. As the author of Hebrews continued, <i>“Therefore do not cast away your confidence, which has great reward. For you have need of endurance, so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise”</i> (Hebrews 10:35–36).\nThe word <i>confidence</i>  means that you have freedom of speech. You can talk boldly about Jesus—about what He has done for you and what He is will do for you. You have done the will of God, but you have not yet received the promises. What do you need? Endurance. You need to hold out from the point where you did God’s will and claimed the promise to the point where you actually receive the promise.

This brings out the association between grace and thanks.\nThis connection is also found in various modern Romance languages.\nIn French, for instance, they say, “<i>Grâce</i> à Dieu,”  which means “Thanks to God”; in Italian, it is <i>“grazie,”</i>  and in Spanish, it is <i>“gracias.”</i>  All are taken from the same word for <i>grace</i>.\nIt is easy to see this connection between grace and thanks. In light of this fact, I want to tell you that you cannot have the grace of God in your life unless you practice giving thanks. Grace and thanks go together. There is nothing more ungracious than an unthankful person, whereas a thankful person will always experience the grace of God.\nGod requires two things of us as His people. First of all, He requires that we appreciate what He does for us. Second, He requires that we express our appreciation. It is important to understand our need to express appreciation to God.',        "dailyPrayer": {          "title": 'Prayer',          "text": 'Thank You, Lord, for all You have done for me.

We are required to appreciate what God does for us and to take the time to express our appreciation. One of my favorite verses is in Proverbs: <i>“In all your ways acknowledge Him [God],and He shall direct your paths” (Proverbs 3:6).</i>\nI have learned by experience that if I pause at every stage in life to acknowledge God, I can be confident that He will continue to direct my path. You might ask, “How can I acknowledge God?” The simplest and best way is to thank Him—say “Thank You” for all He has done and for His faithfulness. You will get immediate assurance that He is going to continue to be faithful. Just as He has helped and guided you in the past, He will guide you in the future. But the key to this assurance is acknowledging Him by our thanksgiving.\nWhen I was in East Africa, I discovered that in the language of my adopted African daughter’s tribe, they had no word or phrase that meant “thank you.” Can you imagine not being able to say “thank you”?\nI then realised that it is only where the Bible has come that people have learned to say “thank you.” It is part of the grace of God.',    "dailyPrayer": {      "title": 'Prayer',      "text": 'Thank You, Lord, for all You have done for me.

For if those did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, much less shall we [believers in the New Testament]  escape who turn away from Him who warns from heaven. And His voice shook the earth then, but now He has promised, saying, “Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also the heaven.”\nAnd this expression, “Yet once more,” denotes the removing of those things which can be shaken, as of created things, in order that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.</i> (Hebrews 12:25–27 NASB)</p>Thankfulness is the appropriate response to the particular privileges and benefits that we have in God. We are not dependent on a shakable kingdom. We have an eternal kingdom, an unshakable kingdom, the kingdom of God Himself, the kingdom that is <i>“righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit”</i>  (Romans 14:17 nasb). In the midst of all that is being shaken around us—all the distress, uncertainty, perplexity, confusion, hatred, division, war, and fear - we have an unshakable kingdom. We have peace, security, and purpose. What is the appropriate response? There is only one: it is thankfulness. <i>“Therefore, since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us show gratitude”</i>\n(Hebrews 12:28); let us express our thanks to God.',    "dailyPrayer": {      "title": 'Prayer',      "text": 'Thank You, Lord, for all You have done for me.

It is something that we owe to God, something we need to pay. But the expression of our appreciation also does something in our own spirits that nothing else can do.\nI express it in this way: Thankfulness releases our spirits for acceptable worship and service. That is why the writer of Hebrews said,<i>“Let us show gratitude, by which we may offer to God an acceptable service with reverence and awe”</i>  (Hebrews 12:28 nasb). Without gratitude, our services to God will not be acceptable. It is that “attitude of gratitude” that makes our services acceptable and releases our spirits.An unthankful person is bound up in himself. He is self-centered.He really cannot know true liberation. But thankfulness releases our spirits.<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>In everything give thanks; for this</i> [giving thanks]  <i>is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.

The only release for the Spirit—to serve God acceptably—is through thanksgiving.\nThen, notice the warning that concludes Hebrews 12: “For our God is a consuming fire” (verse 29).

I would predict that, if you go over that list again, you will find that most of these character defects are already conspicuous in our contemporary culture. And, right there in the middle of the list, it says that people are <i>“disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love.”</i> Notice the association. The ungrateful are right next door to the unholy. You cannot be holy and remain ungrateful. Since our God is a consuming fire (see, for example, Hebrews 12:29), He requires that we serve Him with holiness, which is appropriate. We also have to serve Him with gratitude.

Those who have children train them to say “thank you.” In Britain, children are expected to say “thank you” even before they receive anything. It is simply a matter of proper conduct.\nGod often deals with us in that way, requiring us to say “thank you” before we actually receive something. Oftentimes, if we wait to receive it first, we will not get it.<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful.

Concerning the giving thanks in everything, Paul said, “This is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.” When we are not giving thanks, we are not fulfilling the will of God. In other words, we are out of God’s will. How important it is to understand that!\nThe second thing I want to say about thankfulness, or thanksgiving, is that it is an essential expression of the fullness of the Spirit. Paul wrote, “Do not quench the Spirit”  (verse 19). Here is what he said to the Ephesians: <i>“So then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled with the [Holy]  Spirit”</i>  (Ephesians 5:17–18 nasb).\nPaul provided us with a negative, followed by a positive, regarding the will of the Lord. If we do not understand these truths about God’s will, then we are foolish. Each exhortation is equally valid. It is wrong for a Christian to get drunk with wine, but it is equally wrong for a Christian not to be filled with the Holy Spirit. Sometimes, as religious people, we focus so much on the negative—not filling ourselves with wine so that we become drunk—that we forget about the positive—being filled with the Holy Spirit. We need to be filled with the Spirit.',    "dailyPrayer": {      "title": 'Prayer',      "text": 'Thank You, Lord, for all You have done for me.

It is telling us that our home is not in this world. We have no enduring place in this world. The world rejected Jesus. It drove Him out of the city and crucified Him outside the gate.\nThe Scripture always emphasizes the fact that Jesus’ crucifixion took place outside the city wall. Jesus was rejected. He was put out of society; the world did not want Him. And the way in which the world treated Jesus, sooner or later, and in one way or another, is going to be the way in which the world will treat you and me, as believers. We must be willing to go out to Him—to the place of crucifixion, rejection, and shame—bearing His reproach. Elsewhere in Hebrews, it says that the reproach of Christ amounts to greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt. (See <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/114/HEB.11.NKJV?parallel=151">Hebrews 11:26</a>.) So, His reproach becomes our glory.\nThen, the writer gave a beautiful reason:  <i>“For here we do not have a lasting city.”</i>  Other people may think that this world is permanent, but we know that it is not. “But we are seeking the city which is to come.” I like this translation because it says the city.

They did not really belong; they were seeking a country of their own.\nThere are multitudes of refugees in our world today who are going through the agony of having no permanent place of their own. The people in Hebrews, too, were seeking a place of their own—but not in this world. If they had wanted to, they could have gone back to the place from which they came. Abraham, for instance, could have returned to Ur of the Chaldeans. But he had his mind set forward; he was not looking backward. They desired a better country—that is, a heavenly one.

Even in the church, many people profess allegiance to Christ but reject His cross. Their end is destruction.\nBy our identification with the cross of Jesus, we also rule out pleasing this world. James wrote these stern words to professing believers: <i>“You adulterous people, don’t you know that friendship with the world is hatred toward God? Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God”</i> (James 4:4 niv). James called these people <i>“adulterous.”</i>  Becoming part of the bride of Christ, the church, requires a spiritual commitment—the bride must be single-hearted, totally committed and devoted to Jesus.

Paul expressed it well in Galatians 6:14: <i>“But may it never be that I should boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world” </i>(nasb).\nMay we never boast or put confidence in anything but the cross of the Lord. Not in education, religion, or denomination—none of these things. We can safely boast only in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ, where Jesus won a total, permanent, irreversible victory over all the forces of evil. Through the cross, <i>“the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.”</i>  The cross is the mark of separation between the people of God and the world. When we accept the principle of the cross in our lives, we no longer belong to this world. Jesus gave us this beautiful promise of victory: “I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world” (John 16:33 niv).\nWe are going to have trouble—but Jesus has overcome the world!

And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?” (Isaiah 53:1).\nThe Lord’s Servant, described in earlier verses (see Isaiah 52:13–15) and foretold in this prophecy, is described in the above verse as “the arm of the Lord.”  This phrase denotes God’s power intervening on behalf of His people. It indicated ahead of time that through Jesus Christ Himself, God would intervene to bring salvation to His people. All this was fulfilled in Jesus. He came to reveal God and to bring His salvation and healing to everyone. Peter, an eyewitness of the earthly ministry of Jesus, summed it up: “God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him” (Acts 10:38).\nThe gospel of John applies Isaiah’s prophecy directly to Jesus: But although He had done so many signs [miracles] before them, they did not believe in Him, that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke: “Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”\n(John 12:37–38)\nWe must hold fast to our belief in Him who fulfilled the Old Testament prophecies.

He has no form or comeliness; and when we see Him, there is no beauty that we should desire Him.”  From youth to adulthood, Jesus grew up like a sturdy plant, upright and God-fearing in all His ways.\nThis fact is also described in Luke 2:40: “And the Child grew and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.”\nAt the same time, Jesus was “a root out of dry ground.”  He came forth as God’s messenger to Israel at a period of prolonged spiritual poverty.\nIsrael had not received any prophetic revelation for nearly three hundred years. This prophetic silence was broken only by John the Baptist, then Jesus Himself, who both proclaimed the coming of God’s kingdom.\nJesus had no special outward splendor that would reveal His true identity to people. They saw in Him nothing more than the son of Joseph the carpenter. (See Matthew 13:54–55.) When Peter acknowledged Him as the Messiah and Son of God, Jesus said that this revelation came not through Peter’s natural senses; rather, it was given to him by God the Father. (See Matthew 16:17.) The prophecy continues, “He is despised and rejected by men, a Man of sorrows [pains]  and acquainted with grief\n[disease].  And we hid, as it were, our faces from Him; He was despised, and we did not esteem Him” (Isaiah 53:3). Jesus did not seek the favor of the wealthy. Instead, He devoted Himself tirelessly to helping the poor and the suffering. He faced pain and disease, eventually taking upon Himself the pain and disease of the whole human race. Hanging on the cross in shame and agony, He became “like one from whom men hide their face” (Isaiah 53:3 nasb).

To me, this resolution is very appropriate and beautiful because it is something we are instructed to keep on doing. If we continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, all year long, it will make all the difference as to what the year holds for each of us.This final step of offering up a sacrifice of praise to God relates directly, and in a practical way, to the two previous steps, which were,\n“Let us show gratitude” and “Let us go forth to Him outside the gate.”\nGratitude naturally leads to praise. There are many passages in the Bible in which thanksgiving is related to praise. One of the most beautiful is Psalm 100:4: “Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts with praise.”  The first step in gaining access to God is thanksgiving; the second step is praise. Thanksgiving leads to praise. It finds expression in praise, and it flows out in praise.\nThe step just before this one, “Let us go forth to Him outside the camp,” brings us release from the two slaveries of pleasing self and pleasing the world. Again, this step is directly related to offering the sacrifice of praise. You might not see it at first, but there are two hindrances to spontaneous, free-flowing praise in our lives: love of self and love of the world. As long as our affections are centered in ourselves or in the world, we are not really free to praise God. The cross removes these two hindrances and sets us free to praise God.

But we need to see that the world does not dominate us, that it does not dominate our thinking. We are in the world but not of the world. When we are released from slavery to the world—when the world no longer controls our thinking and we have been liberated by the cross in our inner attitude toward the world—then there is nothing left to hinder our praise.\nWe do not praise God just when things are going right in the world or with ourselves. We praise God because He is worthy to be praised.\nOur liberated spirits are not entangled with self-love and the love of the world.\nYou can find out a lot about a person when you study how much praising he does. Is he a slave to the old man, or has he entered into the resurrected life of the new man? The old man is a grumbler. When we hear a person grumbling, we know that is the old man speaking. But the new man is a praiser. Which are you?

If we grumble, or if we are negative or self-centered, our tongues will bring forth death. But if we are liberated from all of that negativity and are walking in the praise and worship of God, our tongues will bring forth life. Additionally, whatever fruit our tongues bring forth, whether sweet or bitter, we are going to eat of it.\nLet’s go back to our pattern verse for this week. I’d like to bring out one more important point from it. The writer said, Through Him [Jesus]  then, let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God.\n(Hebrews 13:15 nasb)\nOne very significant word in this verse is “sacrifice.”  Praise is a sacrifice. According to the principles of Scripture, a sacrifice requires a death. In the Old Testament sacrifices, nothing was ever offered to God that had not passed through death. So, we see that the sacrifice of praise requires a death—the death of the old man. The old man cannot praise God as He deserves to be praised. There has to be a death.\nAgain, we know that a sacrifice costs us something; thus, praise is costly. Let me put it this way: we need to praise God most when we least feel like it. Praise cannot depend on our feelings. It is a sacrifice of our spirits. ',    "dailyPrayer": {      "title": 'Prayer',      "text": 'Thank You, Lord. I give You praise.

The introduction to this psalm says, “A psalm of David when he feigned madness before Abimelech [or Achish],  who drove him away and he departed” (nasb).\nAt this time in his life, David was a fugitive from his own country.\nKing Saul was trying to kill him, so David had to leave his familiar surroundings.\nHe went to the court of a Gentile king for refuge, but the king suspected him of being an enemy. In order to save his own life, he had to feign madness. The historic book of 1 Samuel tells us that he scratched at the door and slobbered on his beard. (See 1 Samuel 21:10–15.) That was the situation. But what was David’s reaction?\nI will bless the Lord at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth. My soul shall make its boast in the Lord; the humble shall hear it and rejoice. O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt His name together.\n(Psalm 34:1–3 nasb)\nRight there, in the midst of such a terrible situation, with his life hanging in the balance and the shame of having to feign madness, David praised the Lord. That is the sacrifice of praise. When he was at his lowest, David decided to go on boasting in the Lord. When there was nothing else to boast about, he decided to boast in the Lord.\nThen, David went on,  “O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt His name together.”  Praise is contagious. If we learn to praise God in this way, others will join in. But grumbling is contagious, too. If we grumble, we will attract fellow grumblers.

One negative aspect of desert living conditions is that they tend to provoke murmuring and complaining. This happened with Israel many times, and it often brought God’s judgment and disfavor upon them. I got so weary of the desert, the food, and the blaspheming British soldiers that I began to complain. When I did this, I lost the sense of God’s presence and blessing.\nI decided to set aside a special day to fast and to ask God why His presence seemed to have withdrawn from me. I said, “God, why are You not near to me? Why do I have to continue this monotonous, wearisome life in the desert?” By evening, God had given me the answer. He spoke to me very clearly, saying, “Why have you not thanked Me? Why have you not praised Me?” As I meditated on what God said, I realised that I had lost the sense of His presence because I had become unthankful.\nIn due course, the Holy Spirit directed me to various passages along this line, including 1 Thessalonians 5:16–19: “Rejoice always; pray without ceasing; in everything give thanks; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus. Do not quench the Spirit” (nasb). Again, the implication is that if we do not rejoice always, pray without ceasing, and give thanks in everything, we are quenching the Holy Spirit! By murmuring and complaining instead of praising and giving thanks, I had quenched the Holy Spirit in my life.\nGod expects us to continually offer up a sacrifice of praise from our lips—not just inwardly from our hearts.

Give thanks to Him; bless His name. For the Lord is good; His lovingkindness is everlasting, and His faithfulness to all generations” (nasb). Two essential stages in our approach to God are entering the gates with thanksgiving and entering the courts with praise.\nAgain, the psalmist also gave three specific reasons that we should thank God. First, “the Lord is good” ; second, “His lovingkindness is everlasting” ; and, third, “His faithfulness [is]  to all generations.”  Each of these is permanent and unchanging. God is always good; His lovingkindness is everlasting; His faithfulness is to all generations. The primary reasons for giving thanks to God never depend on our feelings or circumstances. We may feel up one day, down the next; sometimes we are encouraged, other times discouraged. But there is no reason to change our attitude of thankfulness to God.\nIn order to approach God on the basis of these three eternal facts, we need to change our focus. We need to look away from things that irritate, discourage, or provoke us, looking instead at the eternal things, which we see through eyes of faith.

Psalm 8:2 says, “Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have ordained strength, because of Your enemies, that You may silence the enemy and the avenger.”  The psalmist, addressing God, was speaking about “enemies”  in the plural and “the enemy and the avenger”  in the singular. “The enemy and the avenger”\nis none other than the devil himself;  “enemies”  are the evil spirits that are Satan’s instruments against us. Because of Satan and his evil spirits, God has ordained strength that we might silence the devil.\nThis verse was quoted by Jesus in the gospel of Matthew. The quotation is a revelation of the full meaning of this passage. In this scene, Jesus is in the temple, healing the sick, and the children are running to and fro, crying, “Hosanna to the Son of David!” (Matthew 21:15). This upsets the religious leaders, so they say to Jesus, “Do You hear what they are saying?” Jesus then gives us this revelation: “Yes.\nHave you never read, ‘Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have perfected praise’?” (verse 16). Where the psalmist said, “You have ordained strength,”  Jesus said, “You have perfected praise.”  So, we get a simple, direct inference. The “ordained strength” of God’s people in battle is “perfected praise.” God has made it possible for us to silence the devil and all his evil spirits by perfect praise.\nAs “babes and infants,” if we will but praise God perfectly, out of our mouths will come forth a weapon that silences the devil.

When we put the name of Jesus on those for whom we are praying, we invoke God’s blessing on them. Few of us realise how much we uplift people in their spirits when we simply praise God for them. It is a major part of our ministry as intercessors.\n“Praying Hyde” was an outstanding missionary in the Punjab in India in the last century, when India was still under British rule. Hyde’s ministry was prayer; everything else was secondary. Early on, he came across an Indian evangelist whom he considered ineffective and cold.\nAs he began to pray about this man, he said, “Lord, You know—” he was going to say, “—how cold Brother So-and-so is.” But the Holy Spirit stopped him with Proverbs 30:10: “Do not slander a servant to his master”  (niv).\nSo, Brother Hyde changed his approach. He began to think of everything good in that man’s life and to thank God for him. Within a few months, that man became outstandingly successful as an evangelist.\nWhat changed him? Not being accused in prayer, but being the object of thanksgiving.\nGod has taught me that if I cannot thank Him for somebody, I probably have no right to pray for that person. I had better not pray at all because my prayer may do more harm than good.

If we do not realize this, it is because we are less than alive; immediately we are alive, life becomes a tragedy. “I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.” When we realize this, then the Spirit of God convicts us of sin. Until a man gets there and sees that there is no hope, the Cross of Jesus Christ is a farce to him. Conviction of sin always brings a fearful binding sense of the law, it makes a man hopeless - “sold under sin.”  I, a guilty sinner, can never get right with God, it is impossible. There is only one way in which I can get right with God, and that is by the Death of Jesus Christ. I must get rid of the lurking idea that I can ever be right with God because of my obedience - which of us could ever obey God to absolute perfection!\nWe only realize the power of the moral law when it comes with an “if.” God never coerces us.

When you obey the call of Jesus Christ, the first thing that strikes you is the irrelevancy of the things you have to do, and the next thing that strikes you is the fact that other people seem to be living perfectly consistent lives.\nSuch lives are apt to leave you with the idea that God is unnecessary, by human effort and devotion we can reach the standard God wants.\nIn a fallen world this can never be done. I am called to live in perfect relation to God so that my life produces a longing after God in other lives, not admiration for myself. Thoughts about myself hinder my usefulness to God.

That is the meaning of sanctification.\nGod puts His disapproval on human experience when we begin to adhere to the conception that sanctification is merely an experience, and forget that sanctification itself has to be sanctified (see John 17:19).

Jesus said, “In the world ye shall have tribulation,” i.e., every thing that is not spiritual makes for my undoing, but - “Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.” I have to learn to score off the things that come against me, and in that way produce the balance of holiness; then it becomes a delight to meet opposition.\nHoliness is the balance between my disposition and the law of God as expressed in Jesus Christ.',        "dailyPrayer": {          "title": '',          "text": ''        }      }       ,"12-05": {        "title": 'THE TEMPLE OF THE HOLY GHOST',        "note": '',        "passage": '',        "dailyVerse": {          "ref": 'Genesis 41:40',          "text": 'Only in the throne will I be greater than thou.'        },        "body": 'I have to account to God for the way in which I rule my body under His domination.

God has made us to have government over all the temple of the Holy Spirit, over imaginations and affections. We are responsible for these, and we must never give way to inordinate affections. Most of us are much sterner with others than we are in regard to ourselves; we make excuses for things in ourselves whilst we condemn in others things to which we are not naturally inclined. \n“I beseech you,” says Paul, “present your bodies a living sacrifice.”\nThe point to decide is this - “Do I agree with my Lord and Master that my body shall be His temple?’ If so, then for me the whole of the law for the body is summed up in this revelation, that my body is the temple of the Holy Ghost.',        "dailyPrayer": {          "title": '',          "text": ''        }      },"12-06": {        "title": 'THE BOW IN THE CLOUD',        "note": '',        "passage": '',        "dailyVerse": {          "ref": 'Genesis 9:13',          "text": 'I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between Me and the earth.'        },        "body": 'It is the Will of God that human beings should get into moral relationship with Him, and His covenants are for this purpose.

Man has to go out of himself in his covenant with God as God goes out of Himself in His covenant with man. It is a question of faith in God - the rarest thing; we have faith only in our feelings.

It is the threshold of an understanding of God. Jesus Christ said that when the Holy Spirit came He would convict of sin, and when the Holy Spirit rouses a man’s conscience and brings him into the presence of God, it is not his relationship with men that bothers him, but his relationship with God - “against Thee, Thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in Thy sight.” The marvels of conviction of sin, forgiveness, and holiness are so interwoven that it is only the forgiven man who is the holy man, he proves he is forgiven by being the opposite to what he was, by God’s grace. Repentance always brings a man to this point: I have sinned. The surest sign that God is at work is when a man says that and means it. Anything less than this is remorse for having made blunders, the reflex action of disgust at himself.\nThe entrance into the Kingdom is through the panging pains of repentance crashing into a man’s respectable goodness; then the Holy Ghost, Who produces these agonies, begins the formation of the Son of God in the life. The new life will manifest itself in conscious repentance and unconscious holiness, never the other way about. The bedrock of Christianity is repentance. Strictly speaking, a man cannot repent when he chooses; repentance is a gift of God. The old Puritans used to pray for “the gift of tears.” If ever you cease to know the virtue of repentance, you are in darkness. Examine yourself and see if you have forgotten how to be sorry.',        "dailyPrayer": {          "title": '',          "text": ''        }      },"12-08": {        "title": 'THE IMPARTIAL POWER OF GOD ',        "note": '',        "passage": '',        "dailyVerse": {          "ref": 'Hebrews 10:14',          "text": 'For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.'        },        "body": 'We trample the blood of the Son of God under foot if we think we are forgiven because we are sorry for our sins.

Our repentance is merely the outcome of our personal realization of the Atonement which He has worked out for us. “Christ Jesus … is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption.” When we realize that Christ is made all this to us, the boundless joy of God begins; wherever the joy of God is not present, the death sentence is at work.\nIt does not matter who or what we are, there is absolute reinstatement into God by the death of Jesus Christ and by no other way, not because Jesus Christ pleads, but because He died. It is not earned, but accepted. All the pleading which deliberately refuses to recognize the Cross is of no avail; it is battering at another door than the one which Jesus has opened. I don’t want to come that way, it is too humiliating to be received as a sinner. “There is none other Name …” The apparent heartlessness of God is the expression of His real heart, there is boundless entrance in His way. “We have forgiveness through His blood.” Identification with the death of Jesus Christ means identification with Him to the death of everything that never was in Him.\nGod is justified in saving bad men only as He makes them good.\nOur Lord does not pretend we are all right when we are all wrong.\nThe Atonement is a propitiation whereby God through the death of Jesus makes an unholy man holy.',        "dailyPrayer": {          "title": '',          "text": ''        }      },"12-09": {        "title": 'THE OFFENCE OF THE NATURAL',        "note": '',        "passage": '',        "dailyVerse": {          "ref": 'Galatians 5:24 ',          "text": 'And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.'        },        "body": 'The natural life is not sinful; we must be apostatized from sin, have nothing to do with sin in any shape or form.

It is the things that are right and noble and good from the natural stand point that keep us back from God’s best.\nTo discern that natural virtues antagonize surrender to God, is to bring our soul into the centre of its greatest battle. Very few of us debate with the sordid and evil and wrong, but we do debate with the good. It is the good that hates the best, and the higher up you get in the scale of the natural virtues, the more intense is the opposition to Jesus Christ. “They that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh” - it is going to cost the natural in you everything, not something. Jesus said - “If any man will be My disciple, let him deny himself,”  i.e., his right to himself, and a man has to realize Who Jesus Christ is before he will do it. Beware of refusing to go to the funeral of your own independence.\nThe natural life is not spiritual, and it can only be made spiritual by sacrifice.

It is the continual assertion of individuality that hinders our spiritual life more than anything else. If you say - “I cannot believe,” it is because individuality is in the road; individuality never can believe. Personality cannot help believing. Watch yourself when the Spirit of God is at work.

Our Lord can never be defined in terms of individuality and independence, but only in terms of personality, “I and My Father are one.” Personality merges, and you only reach your real identity when you are merged with another person.

Our Lord never spoke in terms of individuality, of a man’s “elbows” or his isolated position, but in terms of personality - “that they may be one, even as We are one.” If you give up your right to yourself to God, the real true nature of your personality answers to God straight away.

It is God Who creates the need of which no human being is conscious until God manifests Himself. Jesus said - “Ask, and it shall be given you,” but God cannot give until a man asks. It is not that He withholds, but that that is the way He has constituted things on the basis of Redemption. By means of our asking, God gets processes into work whereby He creates the thing that is not in existence until we do ask. The inner reality of Redemption is that it creates all the time. As the Redemption creates the life of God in us, so it creates the things belonging to that life. Nothing can satisfy the need but that which created the need. This is the meaning of Redemption - it creates and it satisfies.\n“I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto Me.” We preach our own experiences and people are interested, but no sense of need is awakened by it. If once Jesus Christ is lifted up, the Spirit of God will create a conscious need of Him. Behind the preaching of the Gospel is the creative Redemption of God at work in the souls of men.

Suddenly God breaks up a particular set of circumstances, and the realization comes that we have been disloyal to Him by not recognizing that He had ordered them; we never saw what He was after, and that particular thing will never be repeated all the days of our life. The test of loyalty always comes just there. If we learn to worship God in the trying circumstances, He will alter them in two seconds when He chooses.\nLoyalty to Jesus Christ is the thing that we “stick at” to-day. We will be loyal to work, to service, to anything, but do not ask us to be loyal to Jesus Christ. Many Christians are intensely impatient of talking about loyalty to Jesus. Our Lord is dethroned more emphatically by Christian workers than by the world. God is made a machine for blessing men, and Jesus Christ is made a Worker among workers.

It is impossible to deal sympathetically with a case like that: we have to get right deep down to the root until there is antagonism and resentment against the message. People want the blessing of God, but they will not stand the thing that goes straight to the quick.\nIf God has had His way with you, your message as His servant is merciless insistence on the one line, cut down to the very root, otherwise there will be no healing. Drive home the message until there is no possible refuge from its application. Begin to get at people where they are until you get them to realize what they lack, and then erect the standard of Jesus Christ for their lives - “We never can be that.” Then drive it home - “Jesus Christ says you must.” “But how can we be?” “You cannot, unless you have a new Spirit.” (Luke 11:13.)\nThere must be a sense of need before your message is of any use.

If that soul can get to God on any other line, then the Cross of Jesus Christ is unnecessary. If you can help others by your sympathy or understanding, you are a traitor to Jesus Christ. You have to keep your soul rightly related to God and pour out for others on His line, not pour out on the human line and ignore God. The great note to-day is amiable religiosity.\nThe one thing we have to do is to exhibit Jesus Christ crucified, to lift Him up all the time. Every doctrine that is not imbedded in the Cross of Jesus will lead astray. If the worker himself believes in Jesus Christ and is banking on the Reality of Redemption, the people he talks to must be concerned. The thing that remains and deepens is the worker’s simple relationship to Jesus Christ; his usefulness to God depends on that and that alone.\nThe calling of a New Testament worker is to uncover sin and to reveal Jesus Christ as Saviour, consequently he cannot be poetical, he must be sternly surgical.

My experiences are not worth anything unless they keep me at the Source, Jesus Christ.\nIf you try to dam up the Holy Spirit in you to produce subjective experiences, you will find that He will burst all bounds and take you back again to the historic Christ.
