 <p>
    Oswald Chambers (1874–1917) was a Scottish Baptist evangelist, Bible teacher, and
    military chaplain best known for the devotional classic
    <em>My Utmost for His Highest</em>. His Christ-centered preaching,
    emphasis on absolute surrender to God, and posthumously published writings have
    made him one of the most widely read Christian devotional authors of the
    twentieth century and beyond. 
  </p>

  <h2>Early Life &amp; Education</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Born 24 July 1874 in Aberdeen, Scotland, into a devout Baptist family; his father
      was a minister involved in evangelistic work and temperance ministry. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Converted to Christ as a teenager (around age 15–16) and soon became involved in
      evangelism among the poor in London, already noted for his deep spirituality. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Gifted in art and music, he studied at the National Art Training School
      (now the Royal College of Art) in London and later at the University of Edinburgh
      before sensing a call to ministry. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Left his art studies to attend Dunoon College, a small theological training school
      near Glasgow, where he later also taught. 
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Ministry &amp; Holiness Teaching</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Influenced by the Holiness Movement and the Pentecostal League of Prayer, he
      developed a strong emphasis on surrender, holiness, and a deeper life with God. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Travelled widely as a preacher and teacher in Britain, the United States, and Japan,
      gaining a reputation as an insightful and challenging Bible expositor. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Married Gertrude &ldquo;Biddy&rdquo; Hobbs in 1910; she was a highly skilled
      shorthand writer who recorded his talks verbatim, later turning them into the
      books that bear his name. 
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Bible Training College &amp; War Service</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In 1911 he founded and led the Bible Training College in Clapham, London, where
      students were trained for missionary and Christian service in an atmosphere of
      prayer, study, and practical ministry. 
    </li>
    <li>
      With the outbreak of World War I, he closed the college in 1915 and served as a
      YMCA chaplain to British and Commonwealth troops in Egypt, where he taught,
      counselled soldiers, and led Bible studies in the camp at Zeitoun near Cairo. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Known among the troops for his warm personal concern, clear teaching, and
      willingness to offer spiritual and practical help without pressure. 
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Death &amp; Posthumous Writings</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In October 1917 he suffered acute appendicitis; after an emergency operation he
      died on 15 November 1917 in Cairo from complications, aged 43, and was buried
      there with military honours. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Before his death he had prepared his first book manuscript, but the majority of
      his published works were compiled afterward by Biddy from her shorthand notes of
      his sermons and lectures. 
    </li>
    <li>
      His best-known work, <em>My Utmost for His Highest</em>, a 365-day devotional
      drawn from his talks, has remained continuously in print, been translated into
      dozens of languages, and become a classic of evangelical spirituality. 
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Legacy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Chambers is remembered as a deeply God-centered teacher whose life motto was to be
      &ldquo;abandoned to God,&rdquo; calling believers to give their utmost for Christ&rsquo;s
      highest purposes. 
    </li>
    <li>
      His writings continue to shape Christians worldwide, particularly in the areas of
      discipleship, holiness, and wholehearted devotion to Jesus. 
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Max Lucado (born 11 January 1955) is an American pastor, best-selling Christian
    author, and speaker known for his warm, story-rich writing style that makes
    biblical truth accessible to everyday people. He serves as Teaching Minister at
    <strong>Oak Hills Church</strong> in San Antonio, Texas, and leads
    <strong>UpWords, The Teaching Ministry of Max Lucado</strong>, which aims to
    help people take one step closer to Jesus Christ. 
  </p>

  <h2>Early Life &amp; Education</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Born in San Angelo, Texas, and raised in the small West Texas town of Andrews,
      the youngest of four children of Jack and Thelma Lucado; his father worked in
      the oil fields and his mother was a nurse. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Grew up in a churchgoing home but drifted toward rebellion in his teens; after
      a particularly heavy night of partying, he began questioning the direction of
      his life and turned more seriously to God. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Studied at <strong>Abilene Christian University</strong>, earning a B.A. in Mass
      Communication and later a master’s degree in Biblical Studies, where a required
      Bible course and a mission trip shifted his plans from law to ministry. 
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Call to Ministry &amp; Mission Work</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      First served as an associate minister at Central Church of Christ in Miami,
      Florida, working with a singles ministry and writing for the church newsletter;
      these newsletter articles became the seed of his future books. 
    </li>
    <li>
      In the early 1980s, moved with his wife Denalyn to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, as
      full-time missionaries, planting churches and deepening his passion for
      communicating the gospel to ordinary people. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Returned to the United States after several years in Brazil, in part to be
      closer to family following his father’s illness and death. 
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Oak Hills Church</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In 1988, Lucado joined <strong>Oak Hills Church</strong> (then Oak Hills Church
      of Christ) in San Antonio, Texas, where he has served for decades, helping lead
      its growth into a large, non-denominational congregation. 
    </li>
    <li>
      After years as Senior Minister, he transitioned to the role of Teaching Minister
      due to health concerns, continuing to preach regularly and shape the church’s
      teaching ministry. 
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Writing &amp; Media Ministry</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Author of more than 40 books for adults and children, with combined sales well
      over 100 million copies worldwide; his works include
      <em>He Chose the Nails</em>, <em>Just Like Jesus</em>,
      <em>Grace for the Moment</em>, <em>Anxious for Nothing</em>,
      <em>You Are Special</em> (children’s), and many others. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Often described as writing “books for people who don’t read books,” combining
      simple language, vivid stories, and pastoral warmth to communicate themes of
      God’s love, grace, and hope for the hurting and discouraged. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Through <strong>UpWords</strong>, his teaching ministry distributes daily
      devotionals, podcasts, videos, and radio programs focused on helping listeners
      grow closer to Christ in everyday life. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Widely recognized in evangelical circles, he has been called “America’s Pastor”
      and “Best Preacher in America” by major Christian and popular media outlets. 
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Recent Ministry &amp; Ongoing Influence</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Continues to preach at Oak Hills Church and speak at conferences and special
      events, while also occasionally serving in interim teaching roles at other
      churches, all with a focus on encouraging people to trust Jesus in anxious and
      uncertain times. 
    </li>
    <li>
      His books, sermons, and media resources remain widely used by churches and
      individual believers around the world for personal devotions, small groups, and
      outreach, shaping contemporary Christian spirituality with a strong emphasis on
      God’s kindness and grace.

  </ul>

   <p>
    Derek Prince (1915–2003) was a British-born international Bible teacher, pastor,
    missionary, and theologian, known for his clear, systematic teaching of Scripture
    and his deep Christian faith. He authored over 100 books and produced extensive
    teaching materials that have been translated into more than 100 languages and
    continue to influence millions of Christians worldwide.
  </p>

  <h2>Early Life &amp; Conversion</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Born 14 August 1915 in Bangalore, India, into a British military family.</li>
    <li>
      Educated at Eton and at King’s College, Cambridge, where he specialised in
      ancient and modern philosophy and studied classical and biblical languages,
      including Hebrew and Aramaic.
    </li>
    <li>
      Raised in the Anglican tradition, he became an atheist during his university
      years before encountering Jesus while serving in the British Army during
      World War II.
    </li>
    <li>
      On 31 July 1941, while reading the Bible as a “philosophical work,” he experienced
      a powerful conversion and became convinced that Jesus is alive and that the Bible
      is the Word of God.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>World War II &amp; Calling</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Served as a non-combatant in the Royal Army Medical Corps, spending much of his
      service in North Africa.
    </li>
    <li>
      While stationed in the Middle East, he devoted himself to the study of Scripture.
    </li>
    <li>
      In 1944 he sensed a clear call from God to be
      “a teacher of the Scriptures, in truth and faith and love…for many,”
      a word he later saw fulfilled as his ministry expanded globally.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Family &amp; Missionary Work</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Married Danish missionary <strong>Lydia Christensen</strong> in 1946 in Jerusalem,
      becoming father to her eight adopted girls; later they also adopted a Kenyan baby.
    </li>
    <li>
      Lived through the founding of the modern State of Israel, then ministered in England
      (including open-air preaching at Hyde Park), and later served as missionaries in Kenya
      from 1957, seeing significant spiritual fruit. Lydia died in 1975.
    </li>
    <li>
      In 1978 he married <strong>Ruth Baker</strong>, an American single mother of three adopted
      children. Together they launched the radio programme
      <em>“Today with Derek Prince”</em>, which spread his teaching worldwide in many languages.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ruth died in 1998. In his grief Derek publicly reaffirmed his trust in God, a decision
      he described as pivotal for the rest of his life.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Ministry Impact</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      From the late 1960s, Derek became a leading Bible teacher in the Charismatic movement,
      travelling widely and preaching with evident power and authority.
    </li>
    <li>
      In 1971 he founded what became <strong>Derek Prince Ministries</strong>
      (originally Derek Prince Publications) in Fort Lauderdale to distribute his messages.
    </li>
    <li>
      Today, the ministry operates in more than 45 countries, continuing his mission of
      “resourcing the spiritually hungry.”
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Death &amp; Legacy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Derek Prince died of natural causes on 24 September 2003 in Jerusalem, aged 88,
      after a period of declining health.
    </li>
    <li>
      His tombstone describes him as “A Teacher of the Scriptures / In Truth and Faith and Love /
      Which are in Christ Jesus for Many,” echoing the prophetic call he received in 1944.
    </li>
    <li>
      Near the end of his life he said the Church’s greatest need was “serious Bible teachers,” and
      many still regard him as one of the most significant Bible teachers of the 20th century.
    </li>

  <p>
    Smith Wigglesworth (1859–1947), often called the
    <strong>&ldquo;Apostle of Faith&rdquo;</strong>, was a British Pentecostal
    evangelist known for his bold preaching, uncompromising trust in God&rsquo;s
    Word, and a healing ministry that deeply influenced early Pentecostalism.
    Born into poverty in Yorkshire, England, he rose from an illiterate plumber
    to a globally recognized minister whose life and sermons have inspired
    generations of Christians to live by faith and expect the supernatural work
    of the Holy Spirit.
  </p>

  <h2>Early Life &amp; Conversion</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Born on 8 June 1859 in Menston, West Yorkshire, England, to a very poor
      family; he began working as a child in fields and factories to help
      support the household.
    </li>
    <li>
      Though his parents were not committed Christians, his Wesleyan Methodist
      grandmother took him to church, where as a young boy he experienced a
      personal awareness of Jesus&rsquo love and decided to follow Christ.
    </li>
    <li>
      As he grew, he was involved with several denominations and movements,
      including the Methodist church, the Church of England, Baptist believers,
      the Salvation Army, and later the Plymouth Brethren, all of which helped
      shape his devotion to prayer, evangelism, and holiness.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Trade, Marriage &amp; Call to Ministry</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Trained and worked as a plumber in Bradford, combining his trade with
      active evangelism, especially among poor and neglected children.
    </li>
    <li>
      Moved to Liverpool for a season, where he used his wages to feed and
      clothe destitute children and led many of them to faith in Christ.
    </li>
    <li>
      Married <strong>Mary Jane &ldquo;Polly&rdquo; Featherstone</strong> in 1882,
      a strong Salvation Army preacher who helped teach him to read; Smith later
      said he primarily read the Bible and no other books.
    </li>
    <li>
      Together they opened a small mission in a poor area of Bradford. Polly
      preached while Smith prayed, supported the family through plumbing, and
      gradually grew in confidence and calling as a minister.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Baptism in the Holy Spirit &amp; Healing Ministry</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In 1907, during meetings led by Anglican vicar A. A. Boddy in Sunderland,
      Smith received the baptism in the Holy Spirit with speaking in tongues,
      an experience he believed unlocked a new power and fluency in his
      preaching.
    </li>
    <li>
      After personally experiencing divine healing, he began to pray for the
      sick, and reports of dramatic healings spread quickly&mdash;including
      testimonies of people being raised from the dead, deliverance from
      terminal illnesses, and other notable miracles.
    </li>
    <li>
      His ministry was marked by very direct, sometimes physically vigorous ways
      of praying, but his central message was simple: believe God&rsquo;s Word,
      stand on the promises of Scripture, and act in faith.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>International Influence</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      From the 1910s onward, Wigglesworth travelled widely across the United
      Kingdom, Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand, and other regions,
      preaching salvation, faith, and healing in evangelistic campaigns.
    </li>
    <li>
      He held credentials for a time with the Assemblies of God and became one
      of the best-known early Pentecostal healing evangelists, helping to shape
      the emerging Pentecostal movement worldwide.
    </li>
    <li>
      Messages from his sermons were later compiled into influential books such
      as <em>Ever Increasing Faith</em> and <em>Faith That Prevails</em>, which
      continue to be widely read and translated.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Character, Teaching Emphases &amp; Legacy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Known for his intense, straightforward personality, he emphasized four
      simple principles: read the Word of God, let it consume you, believe it,
      and act on it.
    </li>
    <li>
      Despite limited formal education, he cultivated a deep life of prayer,
      fasting, compassion for the poor, and a childlike trust in God&rsquo;s
      goodness and power.
    </li>
    <li>
      Smith Wigglesworth died on 12 March 1947, but his example of radical faith
      and expectation of the miraculous remains a major inspiration within
      Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianity today.
    </li>
  </ul>
