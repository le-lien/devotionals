Reading the Bible Your teachers may pile on the reading assignments, but the Bible is the most important book you will ever read. It’s God’s plan for your life, telling you what is right, what is wrong, and how to get to heaven. When life comes at you fast and hard, the Bible can be your answer book, so it’s a good idea to read something from it every day. Try one of these reading plans to help you get started. Put a check next to each one as you read it. 30 Days with Jesus walks you through the life of Jesus while he was here on earth. 90 Days Through the Bible gives you all the major happenings of the Old and New Testaments, beginning with the Creation in Genesis and going all the way through to Revelation. 30 Days with Jesus 1.
