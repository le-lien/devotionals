As surely as a child breathes, he will someday wonder, <i>What is the purpose of my life?</i>\nSome search for meaning in a career. “My purpose is to be a dentist.” Fine job, but hardly a reason for living. They choose to be human “doings” rather than human “beings.” Who they are is what they do; consequently they do a lot. They work many hours because if they don’t work, they don’t have an identity.\nFor others, who they are is what they have. They find meaning in a new car or a new laptop or new clothes. These people are great for the economy and rough on the budget because they are always seeking meaning in something they own. Some try sports, movies, drugs, friends, sex, you name it. All mirages in the desert of purpose.\nShouldn’t we face the truth instead? Our purpose is to love God. Nothing else will satisfy. ',

Not, mind you, in response to a finger snap, religious chant, or secret handshake. Grace won’t be stage-managed. It’s like Jesus himself: uncontainable, untamable.

To get someone’s attention is no easy task.\nHe must be willing to set everything aside to listen: turn down the music, turn away from the monitor, turn the corner of the page and set down the book. When someone is willing to silence everything else so he can hear us clearly, it is a privilege. A rare privilege, indeed.\nYet your prayers are honored in heaven in just this way. God drops whatever he’s doing to hear your thoughts. He pushes aside all obstacles to hear your message. Your words are like a highpriority text to heaven. They go directly to the very throne of God.\nYour words do more than get God’s attention. Your prayer on earth activates God’s power in heaven, and “God’s will is done on earth as it is in heaven.” Your prayers move God to change the world. You may not understand the mystery of prayer. You don’t need to. But this much is clear: Actions in heaven begin when someone prays on earth. ',

It is a sustained effort to stay focused on God through prayer and belief. To wait is to “rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for Him” (Psalm 37:7).\nIt seems that’s just what Mary did. And God worked as she waited. He sent a message to Joseph. He prompted Caesar to declare a census.

We don’t know when to stand. We don’t know how to pray. Worship is tough stuff.\nFor that reason, God gave us the Psalms—a praise book for God’s people.\nThis collection of hymns and requests is strung together by one thread—a heart hungry for God. Some psalms are defiant. Others are reverent. Some are to be sung. Others are to be prayed. Some are intensely personal. Others are written as if the whole world would use them.\nThe very variety should remind us that worship is personal. No secret formula exists. What moves you may be a dead end for another. Some of us like to throw our hands in the air. Others of us close our eyes and silently reflect on God. Each of us worships differently. But each of us should worship. ',

That machine was secure.\nBut compared to God’s care of his children, workers dumped bare machines into the back of a pickup truck. God vacuum-seals us with his strongest force: his Spirit. He slips us into a suit of spiritual armor, surrounds us with angels, and inhabits us himself.

Earth: So much variety and beauty. How did it come to be? Why does it work in such harmony? Ethics: Throughout history, murder is always bad, courage always good. Who programmed us? Bible: Examine the wisdom.\nExperience the stories. Empty tomb: So many who claimed to see the risen Lord died with those words on their lips. Would they die for a lie?

So talk to God about it.\nGo to him as you would go to a trusted family member. Explain the pain, and revisit your mistake together.\nWhen you mess up and fess up, God may send you to talk to another Christian. “Confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another so that you may be healed” (James 5:16 NASB). James calls us not only to confess up to God but also to confess out to each other.\nPeople are attracted to honesty. You should be too. Find a Bible study or youth group with guys and gals that believe in fessing up. Avoid gatherings where everyone claims to be perfect—you won’t fit in there anyway. Instead, hang out where people admit their sins and show humility. Healing happens in places like this.\nConfessors find a freedom that deniers don’t. ',

And because they had, silence was no longer an option. “We cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard” (v. 20).\nCould you use some high-octane boldness? As long as you are stationary, no one will complain. Dogs don’t bark at parked cars.

It’s important to think about how you’ll react when this situation comes up. Before it comes up. Think about what you will say, and what your decision will be. Make your decision now.\nSex outside of marriage pretends we can give the body and not affect the soul. We can’t. All that we are as humans is so connected that whatever touches the body deeply impacts mind and heart as well. Get too close too soon and guilt and shame are the natural result. On top of that, there are the fears about pregnancy and disease. The me-centered phrase “as long as no one gets hurt” sounds noble, but the truth is, a lot of hurt can come from losing self-control with sexual temptation.\nGod created this wonderful gift, and he wants you to enjoy it—on his terms—within the covenant of marriage. Sex is a celebration of permanence, a tender moment in which the body continues what the mind and the soul have already begun. It’s a time when no one gets hurt. A time that brings joy to man and wife and honor to God. ',

    "body": 'When our oldest daughter, Jenna, was two, I lost her in a department store. One minute she was at my side, and the next she was gone. I panicked. All of a sudden only one thing mattered—I had to find my daughter. Shopping was forgotten. The list of things I came to get was unimportant. I yelled her name. What people thought didn’t matter. For a few minutes, every ounce of energy had one goal—to find my lost child. (I did, by the way. She was hiding behind some jackets!)\nNo price is too high for a parent to pay to redeem his child. No energy is too great. No effort too demanding. A parent will go to any length to find his or her own.\nSo will God.\nMark it down. God’s greatest creation is not the flung stars or the gorged canyons; it’s his eternal plan to reach his children.',

He’s an older fellow, shoulders stooped and balding. Chains are on his hands and feet. It is the apostle Paul. The apostle who was bound only by the will of God is now in chains—stuck in a dingy house—attached to a Roman officer.\nPaul the prisoner has a message to communicate. No e-mail here, however. No Facebook either. So Paul writes a letter. No doubt it is a complaint letter to God. No doubt it is a list of grievances. He has every reason to be bitter and complain. But he doesn’t. Instead, he writes a letter that two thousand years later is still known as the treatise on joy—Philippians.\nHow can a man in chains write about being “full of joy in the Lord” (Philippians 4:4 NLT)? The answer for him—and for you—is in Jesus, who brings joy to the world.',

He goes from heart to heart, asking if he might enter. Every so often, he is welcomed. Someone throws open the door of his or her heart and invites him to stay.

As a youngster I used to climb in, close the door, and see how long I could last in the darkness. I would sit silently, listening to my breath and heartbeats, until I couldn’t take it anymore and then would race up the stairs and throw open the door. Light would avalanche into the cellar. What a change! Moments before I couldn’t see anything—all of a sudden I could see everything.\nJust as light poured into the cellar, God’s hope pours into your world.
