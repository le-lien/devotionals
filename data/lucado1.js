They need someone to lead them “on paths that are right” (Ps. 23:3).\nSo do we. We, too, tend to be swept away by waters we should have avoided. We have no defense against the evil lion who prowls about seeking whom he might devour. We, too, get lost.\nWe need a shepherd. We need a shepherd to care for us and to guide us.\nAnd we have one.
