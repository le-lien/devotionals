If we see only ourselves, our tombstones will have the same epitaph Paul used to describe enemies of Christ: “Their god is their own appetite, they glory in their shame, and this world is the limit of their horizon” (Phil. 3:19).\nHumans were never meant to dwell in the stale fog of the lowlands with no vision of their Creator… .\nSeeing Jesus is what Christianity is all about. Christian service, in its purest form, is nothing more than imitating him whom we see. To see his majesty and to imitate him, that is the sum of Christianity. ',

You will never be called upon to give anyone more grace than God has already given you. ',

When there was no cloud cover and the peak was in view, the climbers were energetic and cooperative. When the gray clouds eclipsed the view of the mountaintop, though, the climbers were sullen and selfish.\nThe same thing happens to us. As long as our eyes are on God’s majesty there is a bounce in our step. But let our eyes focus on the dirt beneath us and we will grumble about every rock and crevice we have to cross. For this reason Paul urged, “Don’t shuffle along, eyes to the ground, absorbed with the things right in front of you. Look up, and be alert to the things going on around Christ—that’s where the action is. See things from his perspective”\n(Col. 3:1–2 MSG). ',

In the end he decided he’d rather have money than a friend, so he sold Jesus for thirty pieces of silver… . Judas was a scoundrel, a cheat, and a bum. How could anyone see him any other way?\nI don’t know, but Jesus did. Only inches from the face of his betrayer, Jesus looked at him and said, “Friend, do what you came to do” (Matt.\n26:50). What Jesus saw in Judas as worthy of being called a friend, I can’t imagine. But I do know that Jesus doesn’t lie, and in that moment he saw something good in a very bad man… .\nHe can help us do the same with those who hurt us. ',

He was still in Mary’s womb when the innkeeper said, “We don’t have room for you.”...\nAnd when he was hung on the cross, wasn’t the message one of utter rejection? “We don’t have room for you in this world.”\nEven today Jesus is given the same treatment. He goes from heart to heart, asking if he might enter...\nEvery so often, he is welcomed. Someone throws open the door of his or her heart and invites him to stay. And to that person Jesus gives this great promise: ... “In my father’s house are many rooms.”...\nWhat a delightful promise he makes us! We make room for him in our hearts, and he makes room for us in his house.',

One minute the shepherd was dead asleep, the next he was rubbing his eyes and staring into the face of an alien.\nThe night was ordinary no more.\nThe angel came in the night because that is when lights are best seen and that is when they are most needed.
