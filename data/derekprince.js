    "body": 'I believe the Lord showed me through an insight into Scripture how we can overcome Satan. Most Christians know that we are to overcome him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of our testimony. But many tend to make it a kind of repetitive phrase: “I plead the blood…I plead the blood.” I don’t want to discount the value of that practice, but I have observed that sometimes it does not impress the devil. I think we have to apply it more purposefully.\nHow do we overcome Satan by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of our testimony? Three elements are involved: the blood, the Word of God, and our testimony. And this is how I interpret the application of Revelation 12:11: We overcome Satan when we testify personally as to what the Word says the blood of Jesus does for us.\nIt is very clear that if we are going to testify to what the Word says the blood does for us, we will have to know what the Word says the blood does. Over the next several weeks, we will be looking at what the Word of God says the blood of Jesus accomplishes for us. ',

There is a parallel for this application in the Passover ceremony, which was God’s provision of deliverance and salvation for Israel. (See Exodus 12:21–27.) The father of each family had to kill a lamb (the sacrifice) and catch its blood in a basin. This act demonstrates the tremendous responsibility of fathers to be priests of their families.\nThe blood in the basin, however, did not protect any Israelite family; it had to be transferred from the basin to where the family lived. Only one means was provided, and that was hyssop. This plant is common in the Middle East; it grows everywhere there. So they had to pick a bunch of hyssop, dip it in the blood, and strike it on the lintel and two door posts of their dwelling, but never on the threshold. You are never to walk over the blood.\nWith that done, the destroying angel could not enter the dwelling.\nBut only those Israelites who were in their homes, safe behind the blood, were protected. That was the only place of safety in Egypt that night. ',

Let’s look at 1 Peter 1:2. Peter was greeting the “pilgrims of the Dispersion [in Greek, diaspora] ”  (verse 1). He was specifically addressing the Jews outside the land of Israel, who were\n“elect [or chosen] according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.”\nNotice that obedience comes before  sprinkling.  The blood is not sprinkled on the disobedient. The blood does not protect those who go out of the house. It protects only those who are behind the blood or covered by it. So, bear in mind, although there is perfect protection in the blood, it is for the obedient alone. ',

As long as the blood remains in the basin, it is not doing any good.\nIt is available, but it does nothing. The Israelites had to take this simple plant called hyssop, dip it in the blood, and strike it on the outside of their houses on the door posts and above the doors. Only then were they protected. Yet in the Passover ceremony, something else preceded the application of the blood.\nLet’s look at 1 Corinthians, where Paul applied the teaching of the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread to Christians. Every Jewish family had to eliminate everything that was leavened from their house for seven days. The Orthodox Jews still observe this practice today.\nTherefore purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, since you truly are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, was sacrificed for us. Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.\n(1 Corinthians 5:7–8)\nWe, too, must purge the old leaven—sin—from our lives in order to live in obedience to God.

When you saw him standing there like that, you knew that he was being sold as a slave.\nPaul was saying in this statement, “My sin is the spear over my head, which has caused me to be sold as a slave in the slave market.”\nAnd there, too, were we—all of us, sold with Paul as slaves because of our sins.\nBut one day, Jesus walked into the market and said, “I’ll buy them.”\nWhat’s the price?

    "body": 'One of the most wondrous aspects of God’s nature is that when He forgives, He does so completely and in full. The book of Micah states this truth beautifully:\nWho is a God like you, who pardons sin and forgives the transgression of the remnant of his inheritance? You do not stay angry forever but delight to show mercy. You will again have compassion on us; you will tread our sins underfoot and hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea. (Micah 7:18–19 niv) Isn’t that beautiful? Every wrong thing that we have ever done—\neverything that could ever make us feel guilty, every accusation that the enemy could ever bring against us—God treads underfoot, then hurls it into the depths of the sea.\nSomeone has remarked that when God casts your sins into the sea, He puts up a notice that reads, “No Fishing!” Don’t ever try to go back and resurrect something that God has buried. If God has forgiven you, you are forgiven. There are no further questions. God’s forgiveness is total. In Isaiah, God speaks to His people,\nI, even I, am He who blots out your transgressions for My own sake; and I will not remember your sins.\n(Isaiah 43:25)\nWhen God forgives us, He blots out the record of our sins; our slates are clean. God does not have a poor memory, but He does have the ability to choose to forget. And when He forgives, He forgets! ',

    "body": 'Through the blood of Jesus, all my sins are forgiven.\nThe type of forgiveness that we need, and can receive only from God Himself, is the vertical aspect of forgiveness. There is such blessedness in being forgiven by God. This truth was articulated perhaps most beautifully by David in Psalm 32: Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord does not count against him and in whose spirit is no deceit.\n(verses 1–2 niv)\nIn the Hebrew language, this psalm begins with a plural noun: blessednesses.  “Oh, the blessednesses of the one whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.” The implication is that there are innumerable blessings attached to having our sins forgiven by God.\nIt is important to see that the Bible does not talk about a man who does not need forgiveness. The Bible clearly indicates that all of us need forgiveness from God; there are no exceptions. In other psalms, David said that there is no man who does not sin. We have all sinned.\nTherefore, we all need forgiveness. It is not a question of whether we need forgiveness but whether we receive it. ',

It was a terrible situation in which David had committed adultery, then committed murder to cover up his adultery. David obviously had been like many of us. For a long while, he had refused to face the fact of his sin. He tried to ignore it.\nIn the next verses, David makes a personal application: Therefore let everyone who is godly pray to you while you may be found; surely when the mighty waters rise, they will not reach him. You are my hiding place; you will protect me from trouble and surround me with songs of deliverance.\n(verses 6–7 niv)\nIt is never too late to confess our sins to God and seek refuge in His salvation.

    "body": 'My personal testimony based on the statement above would be,\n“While I am walking in the light, the blood of Jesus is cleansing me, now and continually, from all sin.” I say it is “cleansing me now”\nbecause that makes it a here-and-now statement, not just a vague generalization. It is for me in the here and now, but it is also continual—\nindefinitely into the future.\nThe Swahili language of East Africa has a special tense to describe things that are complete and permanent. In that well-known song,\n“The Blood of Jesus Cleanses Us from All Sin,” they sing, “The blood of Jesus completely cleanses us absolutely.” These lyrics have stuck with me because they say it so perfectly. So, consider this confession in the light of something that is continual and complete.\nThere is a beautiful commentary on this truth in Psalm 51, which is the great penitent psalm David penned after he was convicted of his sins of adultery and murder. It is one of the most beautiful psalms—a psalm every one of us would do well to read from time to time, making it our own prayer. I believe in making the psalms my prayers; I don’t just read them, but I read them as my prayers.\n“Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow” (Psalm 51:7). You will notice that David introduces the hyssop. The implication is that hyssop is the substance that brings the blood to where I am.

Scores of people claim the cleansing and protection of the blood but do not meet the conditions that entitle them to receive it. Cleansing by the blood of Jesus Christ is a consequence that follows from something that is preceded by an “if”—it is a conditional statement, contingent upon our fulfilling a premise —if we walk in the light as He is in the light. Then, two results follow—not one, but two. The cleansing of the blood is the second result; the first result is that we have fellowship with one another.\nLogically, if we are not in fellowship with one another, it is proof that we are not walking in the light. If we are not walking in the light, it logically follows that we cannot claim the cleansing of the blood of Jesus. So, we come to this conclusion: if we are out of fellowship, we are out of the light. If we are out of the light, the blood no longer cleanses us. The blood of Jesus cleanses only in the light. This is one of the most important principles we can understand. ',

The closer the fellowship, the brighter the light, until you come to the place where there are no hidden corners. There are no shadows; nothing is swept under the rug, nothing is covered up. It can be a frightening place for the natural man. But it is the only place where the blood of Jesus fully fulfills its function of cleansing. If you desire cleansing, it comes in the light. If you are in any way wrong before God, or wrong with your neighbor, you are not fully in the light. And the blood will never be applied except in the light.\nWhat do you have to do? Come to the light. What is “coming to the light”? Confessing your sins, acknowledging them openly before God.\nNow, that is the hardest thing for natural man to do. The light seems so bright.

If we are not enjoying fellowship with our fellow believers and with the Lord, then we are not in the light, and if we are not in the light, the blood of Jesus does not cleanse us.\nThe next question, then, concerns how we walk in the light. The first condition is that we must walk in obedience to the Word of God.\nPsalm 119:105 says, “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.”  The second requirement is summed up by Paul in Ephesians 4:15, where he wrote, “Speaking the truth in love, may [we]  grow up in all things into Him who is the head; Christ.”\nIn this passage, “walking in the light” is defined as relating to our fellow believers in truth and in love. We must be willing to act in truth in our relationships with one another, but we have to do so in love.\nThus, walking in the light consists of two things put together: walking in obedience to the Word of God and walking in truth and love with our fellow believers. When we meet those conditions, then we can say with full assurance that the blood of Jesus is cleansing us from all sin.\nToday we are very conscious of the physical pollution of the atmosphere around us, but the spiritual atmosphere is also polluted by sin, corruption, and ungodliness.

Hebrews 12:22, 24\nreads, “You [all true believers]  have come to Mount Zion…to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better things than that of Abel.”\nIn the heavenly Mount Zion, the blood of Jesus was sprinkled on our behalf in the Holy of Holies before the very presence of God. Christ entered this place as our forerunner, having obtained our eternal redemption through His sacrifice, and He sprinkled the evidence of that redemption in the very presence of Almighty God the Father.\nWe should notice an important contrast here. Early in history, Cain, the first son of Adam and Eve, murdered his brother, Abel. Cain then tried to deny responsibility, but the Lord challenged him and said,\n“There is no way you can conceal your guilt, because the blood of your brother that you shed on the earth is crying out to Me for vengeance.”\n(See Genesis 4:1–15.) In contrast, the blood of Jesus sprinkled in heaven cries out not for vengeance but for mercy. The blood is a continual plea in the very presence of God for His mercy.\nOnce we have testified personally to the power of the blood of Jesus, we do not have to repeat those words every few minutes, because the blood of Jesus is speaking all the time on our behalf in the very presence of God.

Certainly, a vitally important process of change has been set in motion, but it may take many years for that change to be worked out in every area of his character.\nWhen David needed smooth stones to fit in his sling so that he could slay Goliath, he went down to the valley—the lowly place of humility. There in the brook he found the kind of stones he needed.\nWhat had made them smooth? Two pressures: first, the water flowing over them; second, their continual jostling against one another.\nThis is a picture of how Christian character is formed. First, there is the continual washing of water by the Word (see Ephesians 5:26). Second, as we “jostle” one another in personal relationships, our rough edges are gradually worn down until they become smooth. We are “living stones”\nwho need continual smoothing. (See 1 Peter 2:5.) Let me add a side comment that when Jesus needs “living stones”\nfor His sling, He, too, goes to the valley—the place of humility. There, He chooses stones that have been made smooth by the action of God’s Word and by the pressures of regular fellowship with other believers. It is a mark of spiritual maturity to sincerely love our fellow Christians, not simply for what they are in themselves, but for what they mean to Jesus, who shed His lifeblood for each of them. ',

The central theme of Romans is righteousness. Many centuries before, Job had asked the question,\n“How then can man be righteous before God?” (Job 25:4). The book of Romans presents God’s answer. If we are interested in righteousness, we will be interested in Romans. Jesus said,  “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled”  (Matthew 5:6). We can hunger and thirst for healing or prosperity without being blessed. But when we become hungry and thirsty for righteousness, then we will be blessed.\nMuch more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.\n(Romans 5:9)\nNotice that we have been justified by His blood. In both the Hebrew and Greek languages, there is one word that is translated as either “just”\nor “righteous.” In Hebrew, the word is tsadaq, and in Greek, it is dikaioõ.\nBut no matter how it is translated, it is the same word. In English, we tend to refer to just in terms of legality and law, but righteousness  in terms of character and conduct.

This is true in both Old Testament Hebrew and New Testament Greek. The translators of the King James Version alternately translated the same word as either “righteous” or “just.”\nThey tended to use the word just in the context of legal processes and the word righteous  in the context of practical living. But it is one and the same word.\nThe problem comes with the use of the word justified, which is often reserved for a type of legal transaction in the courts of heaven.\nBut this practice means using only half of the signification of the word. To be justified means to be made just, or righteous. The word righteous comes right down to where we live—our homes, workplaces, or personal relationships. Just conveys a legal formality transacted in a remote courtroom. Scripture says (and this is a perfectly legitimate and correct translation) that we have been made righteous by the blood of Jesus. We cannot consider ourselves justified if we have not been made righteous. Justification is more than a legal ceremony or a change of labels. It is a change of character and life, and it is produced by the blood of Jesus. We have been made righteous with a righteousness that is not our own—the righteousness of Jesus Christ. ',

    "body": 'God makes unrighteous people righteous. Scripture says it, and I believe it. Let’s look at one simple verse that affirms this truth:\n“For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him” (2 Corinthians 5:21).\nIn this verse, I like to insert names in place of the pronouns: “For God made Jesus, who knew no sin, to be sin for you and me, that we might become the righteousness of God in Jesus.” There is a complete exchange: Jesus was made sin with our sinfulness so that we might be made righteous with His righteousness. This righteousness is available through faith in His blood.\nRighteousness produces certain immediate and definite observable results. Let’s look at one of those results as stated in Scripture. Actually, our ways of living, our attitudes, our relationships, and the effectiveness of our Christian lives and acts of service will depend on how far we realise that we have been made righteous. We read in Proverbs 28:1, “The wicked flee when no one pursues, but the righteous are bold as a lion.”\nMany Christians today lack boldness. They are timid and apologetic; they tend to back down when confronted with evil or with the devil. The real root cause is their failure to appreciate the fact that they are righteous in God’s sight—as righteous as Jesus Christ Himself.\nWhen we appreciate that truth, it makes us bold. ',

    "body": 'In the book of Isaiah, we read about another result of righteousness in the Christian life: “The work of righteousness will be peace, and the effect of righteousness, quietness and assurance forever” (Isaiah 32:17).\nThree products of righteousness are given in that verse: peace, quietness, and assurance. They all come from the realization that we have been made righteous with the righteousness of Jesus Christ.\nAnother result is described in Romans 14:17: “For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.”\nYesterday’s reading showed us that righteousness brings boldness; today, we add to that peace, quietness, assurance, and joy. All these things are products of righteousness. If we do not receive Christ’s righteousness by faith, we will struggle and try to attain all these other characteristics without ever achieving them. It is pathetic to see Christians  trying to be joyful or peaceful, or trying to be relaxed or assured. Someone has told them they ought to be. But it is my experience that when they really get the assurance of sin’s forgiveness and righteousness by faith, they will find it just happens. Joy flows naturally. Peace comes without effort. Assurance is present. Boldness expresses itself. The root problem is getting people to realise that they have been made righteous with the righteousness of Jesus Christ. ',

The general attitude is that we would be conceited if we claimed to be righteous, that we would be religious if we kept speaking about our failures, our inconsistencies, and the wrongs we’ve committed.\nEvery Sunday morning in the church where I was brought up, we had to say, “Pardon us, miserable offenders.” I always felt that I didn’t want to be a miserable offender, but when I looked at the other offenders, I could surely agree that we were all miserable. Eventually, I said to myself,  If all religion can do is make me miserable, I can be an offender without religion and not be half as miserable.  And that is what I became until I met the Lord.\nThe language of religion continually states, “We are miserable offenders; we have erred and strayed from God’s ways like lost sheep; we have committed the things we ought not to have done and we have left undone the things we ought to have done.”\nI could not say those words now; I would be a hypocrite. How could I pray for victory over sin on a Monday morning if I knew that the following Sunday I would be saying that I had erred and strayed, that I had done those things I should not have done and left undone those things I should have done? It would completely undermine the basis of my faith. Yet it sounds so good, so pious.\nLet’s make our confession in line with God’s Word and believe it: Through the blood of Jesus, I am justified, made righteous, “just-as-if-I’d” never sinned. ',

    "body": 'S anctification is another one of these long, theological words. Let’s break it down. To sanctify is directly related in the original biblical languages to the word for “holy.” So, “to sanctify” means “to make holy.”\nThe English word  sanctify is related to the word saint. Sanctification is the process of making something saintly, or holy.\nTherefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people with His own blood, suffered outside the gate.\n(Hebrews 13:12)\nJesus went outside the city as a sin offering. (See, for example, John 19:16–20.) We learn from the Old Testament that sin offerings could not be offered within the compound of God’s people. (See, for example, Exodus 29:14.) Sanctification always includes separation.\nTo make ourselves holy, we must offer the right testimony:\n“Through the blood of Jesus, I am sanctified, made holy, set apart to God, separated from all that is evil. Between all evil and me is the blood of Jesus.”\nThe one who is sanctified is in an area where God has access to him, but the devil does not. To be sanctified is to be removed from the area of Satan’s visitation and reach and to be placed in an area where we are available to God, but not at home when the devil calls. That is what it is to be sanctified, made holy, set apart to God. ',

It speaks about all the sacred things that he renounces and, in a sense, defiles: Of how much worse punishment, do you suppose, will he be thought worthy who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, counted the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common [or unholy]  thing, and insulted the Spirit of grace?\n(Hebrews 10:29)\nIt is plain to see from this verse that we are sanctified by the blood of the covenant. But here is a person who has been sanctified by the blood of the New Covenant and then turns back. Let’s look closely at the meaning of trampling underfoot the blood of Jesus.

In the Old Testament, there were two men, Enoch and Elijah, who were translated from earth to heaven. And both of them went entirely. All that Elijah left behind was his mantle, but his body was gone.\nAs I understand Scripture, this is true for us, too. We have been totally translated. We aren’t going to be translated; rather, we have been—spirit, soul, and body. We are no longer in the devil’s territory, no longer under the devil’s laws.

His kingdom does not apply to us because we are in another kingdom. We have been translated, carried over—spirit, soul, and body. And this transaction occurs through the blood of Jesus—we are sanctified, set apart to God, by the blood of Jesus.\nNow, let’s consider the implications in relation to the body of the believer. I can say by experience that this is where it really begins to operate, when we bring it down to the realm of our physical bodies.\nConsider this: “Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s”  (1 Corinthians 6:19–20).\nThe words “bought at a price”  take us back to the theme of redemption. We are bought back out of the hand of the devil with the blood of Jesus. How much of us was bought back? Just our spirits? No, both our spirits and our bodies belong to God because Jesus paid the total redemption price of His blood. ',

God has planned for us to be made holy.\nHoliness is a unique attribute among the attributes of God. God has many wonderful attributes—love, power, wisdom, and so forth—\nbut all those have a quality that we could say is remotely reflected in human beings. We have experienced love from human beings. We know of those who are powerful. We have met human beings who are wise.\nOf course, these qualities appear in humans to a degree immeasurably less than they do in God, but at least we have an idea of what these qualities are. But when we talk about holiness, there is nothing else to compare it to. God is uniquely holy.\nHoliness is something that is not found outside of God. Really, in some ways you can measure how much you know God by how much you know holiness. I relate it this way: We thank God for His goodness, we praise God for His greatness, but we worship God for His holiness.\nWorship is the response to the holiness of God.\nIn the Old Testament, God said, “You shall be holy; for I am holy”\n(Leviticus 11:44), and, in the New Testament, Peter restated the Lord’s words, saying, “Be holy, for I am holy”  (1 Peter 1:16).

There was a series of the most involved regulations.\nThese also shall be unclean to you among the creeping things that creep on the earth: the mole, the mouse, and the large lizard…; the gecko, the monitor lizard, the sand reptile, the sand lizard, and the chameleon….Whoever touches them when they are dead shall be unclean until evening.\n(Leviticus 11:29–31)\nAccording to this regulation, for instance, if a mouse died and someone picked it up by the tail, he would be unclean until that evening.\nBut Scripture goes on to give further regulations about the container the mouse might fall in and the article of clothing it might touch, then gives instructions on how to deal with the uncleanness. Observing all of these regulations would be a full-time job.\nGod said that if you succeeded in following these rules, you would be holy. But if you were going to attain holiness by keeping a set of rules, you would have to keep all the rules all the time. You could not omit one at any time.

This passage says the Word of God can bring you into that inheritance. Yet how is sanctification attained under God’s better way, the new covenant? Jesus commissioned Saul of Tarsus when He first revealed Himself to Saul (who later became Paul). He said,\nI will deliver you from the Jewish people, as well as from the Gentiles, to whom I now send you, to open their eyes, in order to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in Me. (Acts 26:17–18) We can be sanctified by keeping all the rules of the Old Testament—\nif we keep them all the time.

He is now the permanent, personal representative of the Godhead residing on earth.\nFrom Pentecost on, each time the Holy Spirit comes to take up His residence as a Person in the body of a believer, it is appropriate that He should manifest His presence by speaking out of that believer in a new language that is supernaturally imparted. In effect, He is saying, “Now you know that I am here as a Person to indwell your body.”\nFor this reason, in 1 Corinthians 6:19, Paul said, “Do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit?”  He emphasized that speaking in tongues is not merely a brief, supernatural experience; beyond that, it is a divinely given sign that the Holy Spirit, as a Person, has taken up His dwelling in the believer’s body, thereby making it a sacred temple.

That temple is the body of the believer, redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ. As Paul explained in 1 Corinthians 6:13, “Foods for the stomach and the stomach for foods, but God will destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.”  This verse talks about food for the stomach and the stomach for food. In Proverbs, it says, “The righteous eats to the satisfying of his soul”  (Proverbs 13:25).\nWe who are righteous do not overeat. Why? Because our bodies are the Lord’s temple, and we are not to defile them by gluttony, drunkenness, immorality, or any other form of misuse. The body is for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body. When I present my body to the Lord, then I have the rights of the Lord for my body.\nLet’s use this analogy: If I purchase a piece of property, I become responsible for its maintenance; but if I live in a rented property, the landlord is responsible.

The key requirement of God is that we listen to His voice.\nFor I did not speak to your fathers, or command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices.

All you get is corruption when you live according to the flesh.\nThere is total opposition between the flesh and the Spirit; there is no reconciliation between them. God’s plan of redemption is to put to death the old, fleshly nature and bring into being a totally new nature by His Holy Spirit within us. Although God has made total provision for this transformation, we have to work it out in our lives. We have to put to death the deeds of the body. God does not do it for us; He has given us the legal right, authority, and power, but we must exercise them.\nScripture says, “But as many as received Him [Jesus] , to them He\n[God] gave the right [authority]  to become children of God”  (John 1:12). We receive authority when we are born again. But authority is useless unless exercised. The new birth is just a potential—the opportunity to develop into something wonderful if we will exercise our authority. If we never take steps to exercise authority in a scriptural way over the problems and sins that confront and beset us, we will make no progress at all.\nWe must move out of one way of thinking—the area of the flesh—\ninto a totally different one. We need the help of the Holy Spirit. “For as many as are [being] led by the Spirit of God, these [and these only]  are sons of God”  (Romans 8:14). ',

Sin defiles. We are inwardly dirty, and we need to be cleansed.\nOnly the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ can cleanse the sinner from all sin. How can we receive that cleansing?  “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9 nasb). God not only forgives the past, but He also cleanses us from all the defilement of sin. In the same chapter, John said that it’s the blood of Jesus, God’s Son, that cleanses us. (See verse 7.)\nThe second phase of this process is regeneration, or rebirth. Jesus said to Nicodemus, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God”  (John 3:3 nasb). This is a birth that comes from God’s realm above. A little further on, Jesus said, “That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit” (John 3:6 nasb).\nWhen we were born of our mothers, it was a birth of our physical bodies and our fleshly nature. That is not the kind of birth that brings salvation. We have to receive a totally new life born into us by the Spirit of God from above. That is regeneration, or rebirth. ',

    "body": 'The process of salvation includes renewing. In Titus 3:5, we read,\n“He [God]  saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit” (nasb).\nThe last aspect that Paul mentioned in this verse is renewing.  We must become new creations. Paul said, “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!”  (2 Corinthians 5:17 niv).\nThe word  “creation”  is important, as there is only one who creates—God. Man can manufacture, repair, or produce, but man cannot create. Our hearts and our whole inner beings have been so defiled and distorted by the effects of sin that repairing or patching up is no good. A new creation alone will be good.\nIn the Old Testament, after David had fallen into adultery, committed murder, and finally been confronted with the awful condition of his own heart, he cried out to God in agony,  “Create in me a clean heart, O God” (Psalm 51:10). He knew that creation had to come from God; it could not come about by any human process.\nIn Titus 3:5, we have seen the three aspects of the process of being saved—a washing, or cleansing; a regeneration, or rebirth; and a renewing, or new creation. God does something that man absolutely cannot do. All of this is by God’s mercy, not His justice. It is not according to our deeds of righteousness—those won’t achieve anything. Salvation has to come from God’s sovereign mercy. ',

    "body": 'All has been settled by the blood of Jesus!\nOne common way in which believers give Satan a legal claim in their lives is failing to forgive others. Jesus taught us that we are forgiven by God in the same measure in which we forgive others. He said, “If you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses”  (Matthew 6:14–15). We are not entitled to claim forgiveness from God in a measure greater than that with which we forgive others. If there is any person whom we do not forgive, in a corresponding measure, we are not forgiven by God. That means the area of unforgiveness in our own lives is an area over which Satan still has a legal claim. We cannot dislodge him until we have forgiven whomever it may be who needs to be forgiven.\nRedemption is coextensive with the forgiveness of sins. If all our sins are forgiven, then we have the total rights of redemption. Satan has no legal claim outstanding against us. But if there is any area in our lives in which sin has not been totally dealt with, Satan still has a legal claim in that area. We can get all the preachers in America to preach and pray over us, but we will not dislodge the devil, because he knows he has a legal claim. We need to remember that the devil is a legal expert. He knows it, too. However, God’s Word offers us total forgiveness of sin. It is crucial that we hold on to the total forgiveness and leave no offense unforgiven. ',

Paul used various words in 2 Corinthians to speak of the battleground and our objectives. In different translations, we find the following words: “imaginations,” “reasonings,” “speculations,” “arguments,”\n“knowledge,”  and “thought.”  Notice that every one of those words refers to the realm of the mind. We absolutely must understand that the battleground is in our minds. Satan is waging an all-out war to captivate the minds of the human race. He is building strongholds and fortresses in our minds, and it is our responsibility, as God’s representatives, to use our spiritual weapons to break down these strongholds, to liberate the minds of men and women, and then to bring them into captivity to the obedience of Christ.

Indeed, you fast for strife and debate, and to strike with the fist of wickedness.…Is it a fast that I have chosen, a day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head like a bulrush?\n(Isaiah 58:3–5)\nFor the people here described, fasting was merely an accepted part of religious ritual, the kind of fasting practiced by the Pharisees in Jesus’ day. Instead of real repentance or self-humbling, they continued with normal secular affairs and retained evil attitudes of greed, selfishness, pride, and oppression.\nThe kind of fast that is well pleasing to God, on the other hand, springs from totally different motives and attitudes: “To loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, to let the oppressed go free, and that you break every yoke”  (verse 6). Scripture and experience alike confirm that there are many bonds that cannot be loosed, burdens that cannot be undone, yokes that cannot be broken, and many oppressed who will never go free until God’s people—and especially their leaders—obey God’s call to true fasting and prayer.\nIsaiah continues to describe our proper attitudes toward the needy and oppressed:  “To share your bread with the hungry, and that you bring to your house the poor who are cast out; when you see the naked, that you cover him, and not hide yourself from your own flesh”  (verse 7).

We must identify this nature in us when and where it rises up. In the ministry of deliverance, there are two demons that are the gatekeepers. They swing the door open for the next demon to come. These gatekeepers are self-pity and resentment. Self-pity is a tremendously powerful tool of Satan, and nobody can afford to indulge resentment.\nAt some point, we must be ruthless. The cross is entirely ruthless—\nthere is nothing comfortable, attractive, or sweet about it. But we thank God for it because it is the way out; it is God’s provision.\nMost of us have a “besetting sin”—a sin we are so accustomed to that we think it is a part of ourselves. We find it hard to hate because it is almost like hating ourselves. Interestingly enough, my besetting sin was my father’s problem before me. Children inherit a lot from their parents, and certain patterns of behavior are set before us. I see behaviors in me that are direct reproductions of my father’s behavior.\nWe need to ask the Holy Spirit to identify the nature of our problems. Call them by their right names (they probably won’t be pretty)—maybe lust, lying, or pride. Then, we must say, “In Jesus, it has been crucified. I put it to the cross. I will not let it dominate me.

Satan is the tempter, but he is very methodical and wastes no time. He will tempt you as long as he gets any response from you. When there is no more response, he won’t bother to tempt you. So, we can be tempted in the area of, let’s say, resentment. We must keep saying, “It was crucified. It has no power in me. It has no place in me.” The devil says, “That isn’t really true. That’s just something Brother Prince said.” But we keep saying it. And after a while, it becomes so real that the devil doesn’t waste his time trying to tempt us any longer.\nOne of the things we have to do is build the walls of our character.\nThe Bible says that the person who has no control over his own spirit is like a city that is broken-down and without walls. (See Proverbs 25:28.) In our culture today, many people are growing up like broken-down walls because of bad homes, drugs, or evil influences. Anybody who has been deep in drugs is definitely a city without protective walls. We build the walls by strengthening our wills and asserting our rights bought by the cross. We may think of this process as a terrible experience. But we don’t realise how much good it is doing us; at the end of it, we have built strong character. Gifts are temporary, for this life only; character is permanent—it goes into eternity with us. God is infinitely more interested in your character than in your gifts. ',

I leave it to you to answer this question. Some people cannot even imagine they can give God glory by the way they eat. But God has said He is a jealous God (see, for example, Exodus 34:14), and He wants to be glorified in every aspect of life—especially the simple, daily, down-to-earth activities.\nBut let me ask you one more question. Is it possible to overeat to the glory of God? I can’t see that it is possible, since overeating is a form of self-indulgence.

Various methods of dietary management are advocated, and among them is vegetarianism. I have met many people who are disposed to be vegetarians. I am not critical of them; I respect them. However, I think there are certain cautions they must keep in mind. Consider what Paul wrote: Receive one who is weak in the faith, but not to disputes over doubtful things. For one believes he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats only vegetables. Let not him who eats despise him who does not eat, and let not him who does not eat judge him who eats; for God has received him.\n(Romans 14:1–3)\nPaul said that we should be careful about our attitudes toward other people. Regarding vegetarianism, he said of the one who eats only vegetables that his faith is weak, for he eschews meat as a means of trying to attain righteousness.\nThen, there is another diet solution advocated and espoused by many people: abstaining completely from alcohol. But Scripture tells us that the Lord “causes the grass to grow for the cattle, and vegetation for the service of man, that he may bring forth food from the earth, and wine that makes glad the heart of man, oil to make his face shine, and bread which strengthens man’s heart” (Psalm 104:14–15).\nGod brings forth from the earth various things for us to consume, including wine, which “makes glad the heart of man.”  Obviously, God does not demand that we be teetotalers.

For every creature of God [every kind of food] is good, and nothing is to be refused if it is received with thanksgiving; for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.\n(1 Timothy 4:1–5)\nIn this passage, Paul was saying, first of all, that abstaining from the marriage relationship (i.e., celibacy) is not an automatic condition of holiness; it does not necessarily lead to holiness. In fact, if we look at the history of the church, in cases where the clergy were required to be celibate, it is apparent that celibacy did not always produce holiness.\nRegarding diets, what Paul was saying is, “Everything that God has created as food is good.” But we have to bear in mind that the good food that God created may be corrupted by what we mix with it or the way we prepare it.

    "body": 'Scripture has led me to some practical conclusions regarding my body. I do not seek to impose these on anybody, but I have given a lot of care and prayer to this subject, and I have been prepared to make radical changes in my own lifestyle, if they are God’s will.\nMy first conclusion, the basis of all the other conclusions, is that I must treat my body with reverence and attune to it as a temple of the Holy Spirit. Again, Paul said,  “Do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit?”  (1 Corinthians 6:19). If we take this passage seriously, then we are going to deal with our bodies as with a temple, for that is what they are.\nSuppose for a moment that God put us in charge of a material temple—a building of stone, timber, and glass. If we were conscientious, we would be concerned about looking after it—keeping it clean and free from dust, with no broken windows or clogged toilets. We would feel tremendous responsibility to keep that building in the best possible condition. As Christians, you and I have an even greater responsibility to keep our bodies, which are the temple of Holy Spirit, in the best possible condition, and we need to find out what is involved in doing that.\nIn his second letter to Timothy, Paul wrote, “For God did not give us a spirit of timidity [or fear],  but a spirit of power, of love and of self-discipline” (2 Timothy 1:7 niv). We see here that the Holy Spirit is a Spirit of self-discipline. But there is a subtle balance: He won’t discipline us if we are not willing to be disciplined. If we seek the help of the Holy Spirit in cultivating self-discipline, He will help us. ',

    "body": 'In making this confession, we need to be radical. Christianity is a radical religion. The word radical  means “dealing with the root.”\nWhen John the Baptist introduced the gospel and Jesus, he said,  “And even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire”\n(Matthew 3:10). God is not going to lop off a few branches or even cut off the trunk. He is going to go straight to the root. He requires that a tree bring forth good fruit. If a tree does not bring forth good fruit, God says to chop it down.\nAmong the younger generation, there is a tendency to be pretty radical. I think this inclination needs to be encouraged—in the right direction. To be honest, we older generations have often compromised rather than be radical. We need to cooperate with the Holy Spirit, who often calls for apparently radical things.\nBut if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you.\n(Romans 8:11)\nPaul was making a remarkable statement here. He said that it was the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God, who raised the dead body of Jesus from the tomb. And if you have that same Holy Spirit in your body, then He can do much that you need in your body through His power.\nWhat a radical truth! ',

I was challenged by the Lord to consider whether I was leading a life of self-indulgence. I was challenged by the Lord to consider these questions: Do I want to go on living? Do I want to finish my assigned task? Jesus said to His disciples, “My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to finish His work” (John 4:34).\nThat is the best diet: to do the will of Him who sent us—and to finish His work.

Paul said that we must make up our minds and take a firm stand against sin. Both sin and Satan can tell the difference between when we are just saying words and when we really mean them. We must proclaim these words with conviction.\nThen, through faith in Jesus, our wills are liberated from the dominion of sin.

It gave me a sense of hopelessness and failure.\nMaybe you can identify with this. I fought this situation in every way that I knew, but I made no progress. Then, I came across Isaiah 61:3: “To console those who mourn in Zion, to give them…the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.”\nAs I read those words, the Holy Spirit showed me, “That’s your problem!” It was like a flood of light coming in. I realised I was not fighting against myself but another being—an evil spirit that was tormenting and oppressing me. When I realised that, I was probably 80\npercent of the way to victory. I actually needed only one other Scripture:\n“Whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved [“delivered” kjv] ”\n(Joel 2:32).\nPutting those two Scriptures together, I prayed, “God, You’ve shown me that I’m oppressed by a spirit of heaviness. I come to You now, calling on the name of the Lord Jesus. Deliver me.” He liberated my mind from that oppressing spirit.\nNow, it was up to me to reprogram my own mind. I had habitually negative thought patterns, which God showed me to be a denial of my faith in Jesus. It was up to me to retrain my mind. Over a period of several years, every time a negative, pessimistic thought came to me, I would reject it, replacing it with a positive confession from Scripture.\nSeveral years later, my whole inner working had changed completely.

We have been set free. Sin must not control our hands, our feet, or our tongues. On the contrary, Paul said, we should yield ourselves to God and our members as instruments of righteousness to God. There’s a double yielding.\nFirst, we yield our wills to God by saying, “Not my will, but Yours, be done.” In the Lord’s Prayer, the second petition is,  “Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven” (Matthew 6:10). When we pray “Your will be done,” it begins with the will of the one who is praying—one who wills for God’s will to be done.\nOnce we have yielded our wills, we then yield our physical members to God as instruments of righteousness. In Greek, the word\n“instruments”  literally means “weapons,” implying spiritual conflict.\nThese are not just any instruments, like a hoe or plow—they are fighting instruments, like a sword.\nThe baptism in the Holy Spirit is key because in that experience we first yield our wills to God; we then yield the one unruly member that we are powerless to control: the tongue. When we are baptized in the Holy Spirit, we actually fulfill the instruction to yield our members to God as instruments (weapons) of righteousness. Certainly, when the tongue has been yielded to God and taken over by the Holy Spirit, it becomes a weapon: in prayer, in testimony, and in preaching. ',

If we don’t will, then, by habit, we will yield to the wrong thing. We must stop presenting our bodies, our members, to sin. When we were still unbelievers, we did just that for a long while. But we have to stop and say, “That’s the end of that!” Once we yield our wills to God, we don’t have to yield our members to Satan.\n“For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace” (Romans 6:14). The implications of this statement are far-reaching. Paul said that we are not under law but under grace.\nIt is either one or the other—it cannot be both at the same time. If we are under law, we are not under grace. If we are under grace, we are not under law.\nMoreover, Paul said that sin shall not have dominion over us, for we are not under the law. The corollary is that if we are under the law, sin will  have dominion over us. That is a shocking statement to many people, but that is what the Bible consistently says.\nWe are not governed by a set of rules. We have become sons of God, and we obey Him because we love Him. From now on, love, not fear, is our motivation for obedience. God does not make us slaves; the Law does that. God makes us His sons and daughters. We have to choose the Law or God’s grace. ',

If we yield to, let’s say, immorality, we become slaves of immorality. We cannot yield to sin without becoming its slaves. Thus, we must decide to whom and to what we want to yield. Some of us don’t like choices, but in the spiritual life, we cannot avoid them.\nAt the end of his career, Joshua gave Israel a choice: Now therefore, fear the Lord, serve Him in sincerity and in truth….And if it seems evil to you to serve the Lord, choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell. But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.\n(Joshua 24:14–15)\nJoshua challenged the Israelites to make a choice, and this choice has never changed. It is not whether we will serve; it is whom we will serve. Serve we will. Before we were redeemed, we had no choice. We could not keep from sinning; there was no other option but to be slaves to sin and servants of Satan. After we experience redemption through faith in Jesus Christ, though, we have another option: we can choose to serve God and be “slaves” to righteousness. ',

Paul wrote,\n“Now the body is not for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body” (1 Corinthians 6:13). Today, we call sexual immorality\n“premarital sex.” But God has not changed His estimate of this sin. The body is not for premarital sex; the body is for the Lord. And then, “the Lord [is] for the body,”  too. Isn’t that wonderful? If we give our bodies to the Lord, then the Lord is for our bodies.\nPaul was a down-to-earth man who talked to people about things that really concerned them. He continued,  “Flee sexual immorality.\nEvery sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body” (verse 18).\nMany people interpret this passage as a warning about sexually transmitted diseases, such as HIV, gonorrhea, or syphilis. These may certainly be consequences of sexual immorality, but Paul’s teaching means much more than that. We endanger the health of our bodies when we commit any kind of immorality. Many times when Christians seek healing and do not receive it, the root cause is immorality. In most cases, God demands that we go to the root cause, repent of it, and set it aright before we can receive healing from Him. ',

The sons of God are revealed at the resurrection; all of creation is waiting expectantly for it on tiptoe. The trees, seas, rivers, and mountains are all waiting. It is extraordinary that creation has so much excitement—and that much of the church has so little.\nFor the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it in hope; because the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.\n(verses 20–21)\nThe entirety of creation suffered because of man’s sin. Before man sinned, there were no thorns and thistles; nothing ever died or rotted.\nAnd we see that we’re not the only ones who are going to come into a glorious resurrection; creation is, too. However, God has assigned this priority: creation does not come in until we come in. As Paul wrote,\n“For we know that the whole creation groans and labors with birth pangs together until now” (verse 22).\nPaul often used the phrase “we know,” yet most contemporary Christians don’t know.

Paul quoted Jesus in 1 Corinthians 11:25, saying, “This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.” Many churches think that says, “As seldom as you do it.” Some of the most beautiful services I have ever attended were liturgical Communion services; they were so beautiful because they held on to that fact.\nAt one point, my wife, Ruth, and I came to the conclusion that we were not taking Communion as often as we should. As the priest of our home, I decided we would have Communion every morning during our time with the Lord. I am not saying that every Christian should do this, but I am thankful that we did. We would have felt that something had dropped out of our lives if we had omitted it.\nEvery day, when we took Communion, we would say, “We receive this bread as Your flesh, Lord, and this wine as Your blood.” I would do this in a simple, specific way, saying, “Lord, we are doing this in remembrance of You; we are proclaiming Your death until You come.”\nIn Communion, we have no past but the cross, no future but the coming. We do it in remembrance of the cross until Jesus comes. Let this compel us to consider whether we are really availing ourselves of the life that is in the blood. ',

Today’s Scripture and our confession for this week refer to a great end-time conflict that involves both heaven and earth—the angels of God, Satan and his angels, and God’s believing people on earth. The statement is made by God’s angels:\n“They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they did not love their lives to the death.”\n(Revelation 12:11)\n“They”  were people like you and me, believers in Jesus Christ. “Him”\nrefers to Satan. There is a direct conflict between us and Satan; there is no one in between. This verse tells us how the believers overcame him, further describing them as committed—totally committed. A committed Christian is the only kind that frightens Satan. When it says\n“they did not love not their lives to the death,”  it means that staying alive was not their first priority. Priority number one was to be faithful to the Lord and to do His will.\nWhen talking about “soldiers in the Lord’s army,” many of us have a vague and sentimental idea about what that means. When I was a soldier in the British army, I did not receive a certificate from the commanding officer guaranteeing that I would not lose my life. Any soldier knows he may be killed; serving may cost his life. It is the same in the Lord’s army. There is no guarantee that we will not have to lay down our lives. The people Satan fears are those who are not afraid to lay down their lives. After all, life on earth is brief compared with life eternal in heaven. ',

Now the devil is right down here on earth, and he knows he has only a few short years to do mischief and cause harm. It is clear to me that this period is closely related to all (or part) of the seventieth week of Daniel. (See Daniel 9:21–24.) It is a specific time period—one that the devil, who is a student of prophecy, knows well. And Jesus has said those days will be cut short. (See, for example, Matthew 24:21–22.) Though theoretically the Bible says three and a half years, there will be at least a few “days”\ntaken off at the end. Then, the devil will be bound and imprisoned in the bottomless pit.\nThe devil wants to keep us ignorant of this fact, because as long we are ignorant, we cannot do what God has appointed. But God has given us the spiritual weapons to cast down Satan from his place in the heavenlies.\nFor the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but are mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, casting down arguments\n[“imaginations” kjv]  and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God.\n(2 Corinthians 10:4–5)\nThe spiritual weapons given to us will enable us to cast down every high thing that opposes God and His kingdom.

You may have talked about what you couldn’t do or discussed your failures and disappointments. But, you see, our confessions determine where we go.\nThere is a vivid example of this truth in the story of the twelve spies Moses sent into the Promised Land. Two came back with positive confessions, ten with negative ones. The majority of the Israelites believed the negative confession, “We cannot.” The positive confession was, “We are well able.” All the Israelites settled their destinies by their confession. Those who said, “We cannot” could not. And those who said, “We are well able” were well able.\nYou may have uttered some negative words, spoken statements that did not glorify Jesus, or dwelled on disappointments that only tied you to impotence or failure. If we confess failure, failure will be our portion. If we confess faith, God will be our portion. Just confess to God, “Lord, I’m sorry. I’ve tied Your hands; because of my unbelief and negative thinking, I have limited what You could do in my life.”\nScripture says, “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness”  (1 John 1:9).\nWhen you’ve rejected negative confessions, thank God that you’ve come out of that dark, lonely valley.

But I do not feel in any way intellectually inferior to say I believe the Bible’s record of creation. Prior to believing the Bible, I studied many other sources that attempted to explain man’s origin, but I found them unsatisfying. In many cases, they contradicted one another. I then turned to study the Bible—not as a believer but as a professional philosopher. I thought to myself,  At least it can’t be any sillier than some of the other things I’ve heard!  To my astonishment, I discovered that the Bible had the answer.\nIn Genesis, we read a short, simple statement. It begins, “The Lord God” —that is, “Jehovah God”—God’s personal name. This term tells us that a personal God formed a personal man for personal fellowship.\nThe Lord God formed [molded]  man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being [soul] .\n(Genesis 2:7)\nHere we see the union of God’s divine, eternal breath from above with the body of clay from beneath, molded by the hands of the Creator.\nThe union of spirit from above and clay from beneath produced a living human personality—one that can have fellowship with the living, personal God.

    "body": 'We know about the inner personality of man—his spirit and soul—but let us not be blind to the fact that man’s body is also a miraculous and marvelous creation of God. Many believers do not sufficiently value or care for their own bodies. Until the breath of God entered that clay form, it was just clay—nothing more. It became a living, functioning physical body with all its organisms, parts, and members through the miraculous operation of the Spirit of God.\nConsider the human eye. On one particular telecast, the American Society of Ophthalmologists presented some fascinating information.\nIf I remember correctly, they said one human eye contains more than three million working parts. What brought that into being? The breath of God. All our muscles, nerves, and glands—all the functions of our physical bodies—owe their origin to the inbreathed breath of God. That is what transformed the clay into a marvelous physical organism. When you grasp that truth, the miracles of divine healing become logical.\nWho can better repair, restore, and, if need be, recreate the body than the same Agent who initially formed it? The Spirit of God is the Creator and Healer.\nI have been privileged to witness creative miracles of God whereby missing bones were restored. I once asked for prayer on behalf of a little girl in San Jose, California, whose elder sister was born with a bone missing from the upper part of both legs. As a result of prayer, God created the bones. I don’t claim that it’s simple, but it is fathomable when you understand the origin of the human body. It was just a clay form until the Spirit of God moved upon it and produced a complex organism that its Creator can heal. ',

Job 10:8–12 is a beautiful summation of God’s creative work in our bodies. Verse 8 reads,  “Your hands have made me and fashioned me, an intricate unity.”\nAs in Genesis 2:7, where the word “ formed”  indicates a skillful work that results from great care, so the book of Job emphasizes the immeasurable skill and care that God devoted to forming the human body:\nYour hands have made me and fashioned me, an intricate unity; yet You would destroy me. Remember, I pray, that You have made me like clay. And will You turn me into dust again?\nDid You not pour me out like milk, and curdle me like cheese, clothe me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews?\n(Job 10:8–11)\nWhat a vivid expression! What a beautiful picture of the interrelationship of the various primary parts of the body. We read on in verse 12, “You have granted me life and favor, and Your care [“visitation”\nkjv]  has preserved my spirit.”\nLater on in Job, we have the other aspect—the spiritual part—of man’s nature: “But there is a spirit in man, and the breath [“inspiration”\nkjv]  of the Almighty gives him understanding” (Job 32:8).\nThese words from Job are in perfect accord with those from Genesis.

I will praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; marvelous are Your works, and that my soul knows very well.

Do not fear therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.”  This statement shows the depth of God’s concern for our physical bodies—He has even numbered the hairs on our heads. When we realise this, we must acknowledge that God also has a purpose for this marvelous workmanship, which is revealed in 1 Corinthians 6:19–20: “Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?

    "body": 'I urge you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.\n(Romans 12:1 nasb)\nIn the early chapters of Romans, we are confronted with tremendous theology. The application starts with our bodies: we are to present our bodies to God as a living sacrifice.\nWe might think, The body isn’t so important; it’s really the soul that is important.  But let’s use a practical analogy: If I asked for a glass of water, I would get both the vessel and its contents. I could not get the water without the glass. That is what God is saying. He wants the vessel, the body—and its contents, the soul. We cannot give the contents without the vessel.\nWhat does it mean to make our bodies “a living…sacrifice” ? The sacrifices of the Old Testament were animals that were killed, then placed on the altar. God says, “I want your body just as completely as the Old Testament sacrifices, but with one difference. I don’t want your body dead but living. When I have your body, I have you.”\nIn Matthew 23, Jesus was talking to the Pharisees, explaining what things really mattered in their service to God. They said the offering was more important than the altar. Jesus said, “You blind men, which is more important, the offering or the altar that sanctifies the offering?”\n(Matthew 23:19 nasb). The altar sanctifies the offering that is placed upon it. The offering is made holy by being placed upon God’s altar.\nThat is how it is with our bodies. When we place our bodies on God’s altar, they become holy. They are sanctified, set apart to God. It is an act each of us has to make. ',

Death is at the end of physical corruption. Paul said, “Through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned”  (Romans 5:12). Through sin, the poison of corruption entered us. First Corinthians 15:56 tells us, “The sting of death is sin.”  Just as a bee or a wasp introduces its poison into a body with its sting, so Satan introduced the poison of corruption and death through the sting of sin.\nWe have all become corrupt creatures. In Philippians 3:21, Paul called our present bodies “the body of humble state”  (nasb). We are in a “humble state, ” humiliated, because we rebelled against our Creator.\nNo matter how elegant, healthy, strong, wealthy, or famous we are, we live in bodies of humiliation. We may eat the finest meals and drink the tastiest beverages, but we will still have to use the toilet. We may be strong and healthy, but when we get really warmed up, we start to sweat.\nWhether wealthy or poor, we all sweat. These built-in bodily functions remind us that we are all rebels and transgressors whose bodies are consequently subject to corruption.\nI spent five years training African teachers, and I was interested in their athletic abilities. I would tell these strong young men, “Just bear in mind, one little anopheles mosquito can come along and insert his proboscis into you, and you will be a shivering, fever-wracked mess.”\nThat is our body of humiliation.

He took the curse that we deserved upon Himself in His body on the cross that we might be released from sin. The Scripture also says, “He Himself took our infirmities and bore our sicknesses”\n(Matthew 8:17) in His own body, that by His wounds we might be healed. (See 1 Peter 2:24 nasb, niv.) As far as God is concerned, our release from sin is already accomplished. As far as God is concerned, it is already done.\nIt is interesting to note that the New Testament does not put healing in the future, but in the past. We have been healed ever since the death of Jesus, “by whose stripes you were healed” (emphasis added). Healing has already been provided. Christians sometimes ask me, “How can I know if it’s God’s will for me to be healed?” I usually answer, “If you are a committed Christian, redeemed by the blood of Jesus, I think you’re asking the wrong question. The question is not, ‘How can I know if it’s God’s will for me to be healed?’ The question is, ‘How can I appropriate the healing that God has already provided for me?’” God’s purpose is to preserve the whole of us: spirit, soul, and body, as Paul said,  “Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely [make you completely holy] ; and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ” (1 Thessalonians 5:23).

The Lord will guard your going out and your coming in from this time forth and forever”\n(nasb).

Those are beautiful words, but the most exciting thing about them is that they are being fulfilled in this generation, in our lifetime.\nI have seen the outworking of those words. Again, I had the privilege to be living in Jewish Jerusalem in May 1948, when the State of Israel was reborn after two thousand years. Today, the Lord is building up Jerusalem. He is gathering the exiles of Israel. He is healing the brokenhearted and binding up their wounds.\nThat is good news for all who will turn to God. It is good news for God’s people, Israel. It is also good news for the church of Jesus Christ because the same God who is gathering Israel is gathering the church back to Himself, bringing us into our inheritance, healing our wounds, and binding up our broken hearts.\nThere is an ongoing ministry of the Holy Spirit that is very special—a ministry to the brokenhearted.

Without the Jews, we would have no patriarchs, no prophets, no apostles, no Bible—and no Savior! Without all these, how much salvation would we receive? None! The Bible makes it clear that God requires the Christians of all other nations to acknowledge their debt to the Jews and to do what they can to repay it. In Romans 11:30–31, Paul summed up what he had been saying about the debt and the responsibility of the Gentile Christians toward Israel.\nFor as you [Gentiles] were once disobedient to God, yet have now obtained mercy through their [Israel’s]  disobedience, even so these [Israelites]  also have now been disobedient, that through the mercy shown you [Gentiles]  they [Israel]  also may obtain mercy.\nIn other words, because of God’s mercy that has come to us Gentile Christians through Israel, God requires us in our turn to show mercy to Israel. How shall we fulfill this obligation? The following are four practical ways that we may do so.\nFirst, we can cultivate and express an attitude of sincere love for Jewish people.\nSecond, we can enjoy and demonstrate the abundance of God’s blessings in Christ in such a way that the Jews may be made jealous and desire what they see us enjoying.\nThird, we can seek the good of Israel through our prayers and petitions, as the Bible exhorts us to do. (See Romans 10:1.) Fourth, we can seek to repay our debt to Israel by performing practical acts of kindness and mercy. ',

Events in Israel and the Middle East today are at the center of world attention and media coverage.\nThis period of Israel’s regathering at the end of the age was marked out clearly on God’s great prophetic calendar three thousand years ago.\nHere is one of the passages that make this clear: You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to show favor to her; the appointed time has come. For her stones are dear to your servants; her very dust moves them to pity. The nations will fear the name of the Lord, all the kings of the earth will revere your glory. For the Lord will rebuild Zion and appear in his glory….Let this be written for a future generation, that a people not yet created may praise the Lord.\n(Psalm 102:13–16, 18 niv)\nNow is God’s appointed time to have mercy on Zion and to show favor to her. This is not something that Zion or the Jewish people have earned, but something that comes out of God’s sovereign grace and mercy. One of the main purposes of what God is doing is to bring glory to His own name in the sight of all the nations by fulfilling His promises to Israel. The rebuilding of Zion is one of the great biblical signs that the time is at hand for the Lord to appear in His glory. We have the great privilege of living in the time that the psalmist here foresaw.

It is of tremendous importance that we grasp the fact that when God makes a covenant, He will never break it. We need to know that.\nOur Bible consists of two covenants: the old and the new. Therefore, the essence of divine revelation is centered in covenant. If God were to break His covenant, we would have no hope. It is my personal conviction that if God were to break His covenant with Israel, we would have no reason to believe that He would not break His covenant with the church. You may say, “Well, Israel failed God.” Undoubtedly. But can you honestly say that the church has not also failed God?\nI am not capable of presenting God’s point of view, but in my limited understanding, I see Israel receiving a covenant and failing dismally. I see the church receiving a covenant and failing even worse than Israel.\nWhat is God saying to us about the restoration of Israel? I suggest that God is saying at least four things, all of them extremely topical, relevant, and important for the church of Jesus Christ.\nFirst, God is saying that the Bible is a true, relevant, up-to-date book.\nSecond, God is saying that He keeps His covenant.\nThird, God is saying to us that He is sovereign.\nThe fourth thing the Lord is saying is that in restoring the Israelites to their land, God has set the stage for the last act of the drama of this age. Every prophecy that relates to the close of this age is predicated on one important factor—the presence of Israel as a sovereign nation within its own borders. ',

Make your praises heard, and say, “O Lord, save your people, the remnant of Israel.”\n(Jeremiah 31:7–8 niv)\nThe New American Standard Bible reads, “Proclaim, give praise, and say”  (verse 7). Combining these two versions, I find there are five responses that God requires. In a sense, they are all vocal: sing, shout, praise, proclaim, and say (or pray).\nWhat are we responding to? The regathering of the remnant of Jacob. To whom is this command addressed? The church, we who believe that the Bible is the Word of God and that we ought to obey it.\nGod is asking us to intercede for Israel. He is saying, “I am restoring My people. I am regathering them, and I am asking you to unite with Me and My purposes through prayer.” I think we must all face this as one of the mysterious facts about God: when He intends to do something, He will say to His people, “Pray that I will do it.” In other words, He says, “This is My intention, but it will not happen until you pray.”\nAs Christians, we have a tremendous responsibility to be totally committed to the outworking of God’s purposes in history.

But verse 5 says, “He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised [“crushed” niv]  for our iniquities; the chastisement [“punishment” niv]  for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes [“wounds” niv] we are healed.”\nTwo major transactions are mentioned in those verses. The punishment due to our wrongdoing came upon Jesus so that we might be forgiven and have peace. Until the punishment for sin had been inflicted, there was no possibility of peace. Let’s look at another passage in Ephesians where Paul was speaking about what took place on the cross: He Himself is our peace,  who has made both [Jew and Gentile]\none, and has broken down the middle wall of separation, having abolished in His flesh the enmity, that is, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, so as to create in Himself one new man from the two, thus making peace, and that He might reconcile them both to God in one body through the cross, thereby putting to death the enmity. And He came and preached peace to you who were afar off and to those who were near.\n(Ephesians 2:14–17, emphasis added)\nNotice the emphasis on the word “peace.”  There can be no peace for the sinner until he knows that his sins have been forgiven. Jesus was punished so that we might have peace with God through forgiveness.\n(See also Colossians 1:19–20.) ',

In return, we were totally forgiven and delivered from the power of evil.\n“In Him [Jesus]  we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace” (Ephesians 1:7).\nWhen we have forgiveness of sins, we have redemption; we have been redeemed. Redeem  means “to buy back,” or “to ransom.” Through the payment of His blood, given as a sacrifice on our behalf, Jesus bought us back from Satan for God.\nIn Romans 7, Paul said something that is not always clear to people who are not familiar with the cultural context of his day: “I am carnal, sold under sin”  (verse 14). Remember that the phrase “sold under sin”\nrelates to the Roman slave market. Someone being sold as a slave had to stand on a block, and from a post behind him, a spear was extended over his head. So, Paul said, “I am carnal, sold under the spear of my sin, which is extended over my head. I have no options. I’m for sale.”\nWhen a person is a slave, he has no choices. Again, two women may be sold in the same market; the owner makes one a cook, the other a prostitute. The same is true with us as sinners. We may be good, respectable sinners and look down on prostitutes and addicts. But it is the slave owner who determines the slave’s service.\nThe good news is that Jesus walked into the slave market and said,\n“I’ll buy her; I’ll buy him. Satan, I’ve paid the price. These are now My son and daughter.” That is redemption, and it comes only through the forgiveness of sins. ',

    "body": 'What makes the word forgiveness so special and beautiful?\nWell, consider some of the results that flow from forgiveness: reconciliation, peace, harmony, understanding, fellowship. Or consider some of the consequences that flow from our failure to forgive and be forgiven: bitterness, strife, disharmony, hatred, war. At times, it seems as if the human race is in danger of being overwhelmed by these evil, negative forces. We can escape this terrible fate only as we learn and apply the principles of forgiveness.\nLet us remember that two directions of forgiveness are represented in the Bible. They are well portrayed by the symbol of our Christian faith, the cross, which has two beams—one vertical and one horizontal. These beams represent the two directions of forgiveness: the vertical beam represents the forgiveness we need to receive from God; the horizontal beam represents the forgiveness we need to receive from others, as well as the forgiveness we must extend. The grace for this kind of forgiveness comes only through the cross.\nThe kind of forgiveness we need and can receive from God is set forth most beautifully in Psalm 32:1–2, where David said, “Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord does not count against him and in whose spirit is no deceit” (niv).\nAgain, the Bible does not talk about a man who does not need forgiveness. It clearly indicates that all of us need forgiveness from God.\nThere are no exceptions. Other psalms tell us there is no man who does not sin. (See, for example, Psalm 14:1–3; 53:1–3.) We have all sinned.\nTherefore, we all need forgiveness. ',

Referring to when he was found guilty of committing adultery and murder in the matter of Bathsheba, David continued in his psalm, When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long. For day and night your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was sapped as in the heat of summer. Then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my iniquity.\nI said, “I will confess my transgressions to the Lord”—and you forgave the guilt of my sin.\n(verses 3–5 niv)\nLike many people, David refused to admit his sin and tried to pretend it never happened, covering it up. But all the time he was like a man with a burning fever. His “strength was sapped”  and his “bones wasted away.”  Unforgiven sin can produce physical results.\nA psychiatrist related this story to me. While visiting a hospital, he met a woman who was in a hopeless condition. Her kidneys had ceased to function, her skin was discolored, and she was in a coma, simply waiting to die. One day, he was prompted by the Holy Spirit to say, “In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I remit your sins,” later wondering if he had done something foolish. About a week later, he was amazed to see the woman walking down the street—completely healed.\nUnforgiven sin had caused her physical condition. When her sins were forgiven through this man’s intercession, her spirit was clear with God and the way was open for her to be healed. ',

This petition says, in other words, “Forgive us as we forgive.” Remember that in the same proportion that you forgive others, God will forgive you. If you totally forgive others, God will totally forgive you. But if you only partly forgive others, God will only partly forgive you.\nOne major reason that many Christians do not receive answers to prayer is their failure to forgive others, usually one specific person.\nIn my experiences with counseling people, I have found unforgiveness to be a common source of blockage in their spiritual lives. I once asked a woman whom I was counseling, “Is there anybody you haven’t forgiven?” She said, “Yes” and went on to specify a distinguished person in the United States Department of Justice. I said, “If you want release, you will have to forgive him. There is no alternative. If you don’t forgive him, God does not forgive you.”\nAre we willing to forgive? We may think, I don’t know if I can. God may also say, “I don’t know if I can.” We had better make up our minds.\nForgiveness is not an emotion; it is a decision. I call this “tearing up the IOU.” Somebody might owe us thirty thousand dollars, but we could owe God six million dollars. If we want Him to tear up His IOU, we must first tear up ours.\nThat is God’s unvarying law. It is built into the Lord’s Prayer. And the last petition in the Lord’s Prayer is a petition for deliverance from the evil one, Satan. We have no right to pray for deliverance until we have forgiven others as we would have God forgive us. ',

To escape from the curse, you need to deal with the sin that exposed you or your ancestors to the curse. You do this by confessing the sin and asking God to forgive and blot it out. Proverbs 28:13 says,  “He who covers his sins will not prosper, but whoever confesses and forsakes them will have mercy.”  If you cover sin, you will not prosper or be blessed. However, if you confess your sin and forsake it, then you will have God’s mercy and redemption from the curse. Again, you must also forgive all other persons. Jesus said,\nAnd whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone; so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your transgressions.\n(Mark 11:25 nasb)\nThis is very important. Jesus makes it clear that if we hold unforgiveness, bitterness, or resentment in our hearts when we pray, we erect barriers to the answer to our prayers. It will keep us under the curse. By a decision of our wills, when we pray, we must lay down any kind of resentment, bitterness, or unforgiveness against any person. In the measure in which we forgive others, God forgives us. If we want total forgiveness from God, we must offer total forgiveness to others.\nThis is not being super-spiritual; forgiving other people means that you’re exercising what I call “enlightened self-interest.” ',

I don’t want to stir up controversy, but you can be born again without being baptized. If you want to be saved,  however, baptism is a key part of the process, for\n“He who believes and is baptized will be saved” (Mark 16:16).\nBeing saved means much more than just getting your soul ready for heaven. Someone once said, “The evangelical concept of salvation is to get souls prepackaged for heaven.” That may be so, to a degree, but salvation includes a lot more than being prepackaged for heaven.\nI want to examine a passage from the New Testament in which the writer used the Greek word for “to save,” which is sozo. If we look at where this word appears in the Scriptures, it will give us an idea of what is included in salvation.\nThe book of Matthew speaks about Jesus’ ministry to the sick, saying,\n“They…brought to Him all who were sick….And as many as touched it\n[His garment]  were made perfectly well [“whole” kjv] ” (Matthew 14:35–\n36) .  The verb used for “well” or “whole” is sozo, but it is preceded by a Greek preposition that means “thoroughly.” To be “thoroughly saved”\nis to be perfectly healed.

All he wanted was to get his sight, and get it he did. “Then, Jesus said to him, ‘Go your way; your faith has made you well.’ And immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus on the road” (verse 52). The literal Greek translation of Jesus’ words reads, “Your faith has saved you.” That’s salvation.\nIn Luke 8:43–48, we read about the woman with the issue of blood who came behind Jesus and touched Him. She did not want to be recognized, however, because according to Jewish law, anyone with an issue of blood was unclean and was not free to touch anybody. This woman was embarrassed, but she was so desperate for healing that she defied the Law.\nNow when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling; and falling down before Him, she declared to Him in the presence of all the people the reason she had touched Him and how she was healed immediately. And He [Jesus] said to her,\n“Daughter, be of good cheer; your faith has made you well [sozo] .\nGo in peace.”\n(verses 47–48)\nHow wonderful!

Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?” Then he said to him, “Rise and go; your faith has made you well.”\n(Luke 17:12–19 niv)\nAll ten lepers were healed physically. But something extra happened to the one who returned to give thanks. Jesus said, “Rise and go; your faith has made you well.”  The word for “well”  in Greek is sozo, meaning\n“to save.” Again, it nearly always indicates something more than mere physical or temporary provision from God. It is the all-inclusive word for salvation.\nThere was one important difference between the lepers. Nine were healed in an exclusively physical sense. The tenth, who came back to give thanks to God, was healed not only physically, but also spiritually—\nhis soul was saved. He was brought into a right, eternal relationship with God. The nine others received a partial, temporary blessing; the tenth received total, permanent blessing. The difference was the giving of thanks. ',

But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed.\n(Isaiah 53:4–5)\nThis translation is not literal, and it has consequently deprived millions of English-speaking believers of their physical rights in Christ. Still, there is no doubt as to the correct meaning of these words.  “Griefs”  should be “sicknesses”;  “sorrows”  should be “pains.” They are basic Hebrew root words, used with these meanings in the days of Moses and having the same meanings today. This is stated clearly in Scripture:\n[Jesus]  cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying: “He Himself took our infirmities and bore our sicknesses.”\n(Matthew 8:16–17)\n[He]  Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness; by whose stripes you were healed.\n(1 Peter 2:24)\nWe see that Matthew and Peter, Jews alike who knew Hebrew and were inspired by the Holy Spirit, gave the correct meanings to those words of Isaiah. If you combine these passages from Matthew and Peter, you get three statements taken from Isaiah 53:4–5 about the physical and spiritual realms. Physical realm: He took our infirmities; He bore our sicknesses; we are healed. Spiritual realm: He was wounded for our transgressions; He was bruised for our iniquities; the punishment that procured our peace was upon Him. ',

Sometimes sicknesses are caused by, or associated with, the presence of evil spirits. Let’s look at just one example from the gospel of Luke.\nWhen the sun was setting, all those who had any that were sick with various diseases brought them to Him; and He laid His hands on every one of them and healed them.

Because in the eternal counsel of God, He had already taken our sicknesses and borne our pains. That is good news! If the church really believed that, evangelism would be pretty simple.\nGoing to Pakistan was a revealing experience for me because the population is 98 percent Muslim. We had as many as 16,000 people in our meetings without much advertising. Why? Because we prayed for the sick—and they were healed. Not all of them, more like just a few of them.

At that time, I received this word from God: “Consider the work of Calvary; a perfect work—perfect in every respect, perfect in every aspect.” I have been considering this statement ever since, and I have only touched the fringe of what took place at the cross. It is a perfect work. From whatever aspect we view the cross, it is finished. Whatever type of help we need, it is settled forever at the cross.\n“That sounds easy,” you may say, “but how can we appropriate it?” On the subject of healing, many people wonder, How can I know whether it’s God’s will to heal?\nIf we are children of God, we are asking the wrong question.\nHealing is the children’s bread. Jesus said,  “It is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the little dogs [unbelievers] ”  (Matthew 15:26). The Syro-Phoenician woman had the right answer: “Lord, I don’t need a loaf. Just give me a crumb and it’ll get the demon out of my daughter.” That woman really had faith—a lot more than the children who had the whole loaf offered them and were still sick! A father may not be able to give his family ice cream or T-bone steaks, but every father has an obligation to provide bread. God the Father has put the children’s bread on the table—yours and mine.\nI rephrase the question in this way: How may I appropriate the healing that is already provided? For the believer, healing and the atonement are never in the future. It is now up to us to appropriate our inheritance. All is provided for us in the testament—the will sealed by the death of Jesus.

The exchange there is very clear: Jesus was made sin so that we might become righteousness. Notice that it is not by our own righteousness that we are made righteous, but by the righteousness of God. In Matthew 6:33, Jesus said, “But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.”\nThe only righteousness acceptable in heaven is the righteousness of God received through faith in Jesus Christ. Isaiah 64:6 reads, “We are all like an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are like filthy rags.”  This verse does not say that all our sins are like filthy rags, but that all our righteousnesses are like filthy rags. Even the best efforts we make to be religious—to please God and serve Him in our own strength—are but filthy rags. These filthy rags do not fit us for the courts of heaven. God requires that we put away those filthy rags of our own righteousness. We must cease from relying on our own good works and religious activities, acknowledging that we are sinful.

It means it was the Lord’s decision, or purpose. For instance, a criminal in Britain is sentenced by the judge to be detained “for the queen’s pleasure.” It’s not that the queen takes pleasure in the detention of the criminal, but that she considers it necessary. Historically, this phrase goes back to the Elizabethan period in England. So, when Scripture says  “it pleased the Lord,”  it does not mean the Lord took pleasure in bruising His Son, but rather that it was the Lord’s decision, it was His purpose. He saw fit to do it; He saw that it was necessary.\nThe Hebrew language is so condensed that it is almost impossible to translate it completely and accurately into another language. There are only about four Hebrew words in the first two lines of that verse.\nWhere it says “It pleased the Lord to bruise Him; He has put Him to grief,”  the best translation I can find is “unto sickness” or “to make Him sickness by bruising Him.” The word translated “put Him to grief”\n(chalah) occurs also in Micah 6:13. God was speaking to rebellious, stubborn Israel, saying, “Therefore also I will make you sick [chalah]  by striking you.”  There, the New King James Version has translated it by the correct, literal word.

His body was crushed, marred, mutilated—whatever word you want to use. He became total sickness on the cross.\nWhen You [God]  make His [Jesus’]  soul an offering for sin, He shall see His seed.\n(Isaiah 53:10)\nWhere the English says  “an offering for sin,”  the Hebrew uses only one word,  asham,  which means “guilt,” “sin,” or “sin offering.” In the language of the Old Testament, the same word was used for both guilt and guilt offering. Why? Because under the Levitical law, when the sacrificial animal was brought as a sin offering, the man whose sin was being atoned for laid his hands on the head of the animal and confessed his sin over that animal, thereby symbolically transferring his sin to the animal. In that way, the sin offering became sin with the man’s sin. Then, the animal was dealt with; instead of the man being killed, the animal was.\nAll this, of course, is representative of the death of Christ. The writer of Hebrews said it was not possible for the blood of bulls or goats to take away sins. (See Hebrews 10:4.) The sacrificial system was just a picture leading up to the transaction that was fulfilled on the cross.\nBut here, speaking about the actual event, the Scripture says that God made the soul of Jesus to be sin. That is the real meaning of “make His soul an offering for sin.”  The apostle Paul confirmed this point when he quoted Isaiah 53:10 in this passage: “For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him”\n(2 Corinthians 5:21).

Through the death of Jesus Christ on our behalf—through our Representative, who carried our guilt and paid our penalty—God is able to forgive every one of our sinful acts without compromising His own justice, because His justice has been satisfied by the death of Christ. We need to understand that all our past sinful acts, no matter how numerous or how serious, have been forgiven when we put our faith in Jesus.\nGod not only has made complete provision for the past, but also has made complete provision for the future,  “having canceled the written code, with its regulations, that was against us and that stood opposed to us; he took it away, nailing it to the cross” (verse 14 niv).\nThe written code is the law of Moses. On the cross, Jesus did away with the law of Moses as a means of obtaining righteousness with God.\nAs long as the law was the requirement for righteousness, every time we broke even one of the most minor requirements, we were guilty before God. But when the law was taken out of the way, provision was made for us to live free from guilt because our faith is now reckoned to us as righteousness. As Paul wrote, “For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes” (Romans 10:4 nasb). Christ is the end of the law for righteousness for everyone who believes—Jew or Gentile, Catholic or Protestant, it makes no difference.

If we Christians used the Bible in the same simple, practical way that chefs use cookbooks, we would find that God’s recipes always work. The Romans Recipe is God’s way of making the truths of the gospel work in our lives.\nWhat shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? By no means! We died to sin; how can we live in it any longer? Or don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life. If we have been united with him like this in his death, we will certainly also be united with him in his resurrection. For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin—because anyone who has died has been freed from sin. Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him. The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.\n(Romans 6:1–10 niv)\nThe outcome of this “recipe” is tremendous:  “sin shall not be your master” —sin will no longer dominate or control you. Deliverance from sin and all its evil consequences comes through our identification with Jesus Christ in His death, burial, resurrection, and ascension. ',

When Jesus was crucified, our “old self”  (verse 6), the rebel nature we inherited from Adam, was also crucified. Second,\n“we were…buried with him”  (verse 4). By baptism into His death, we died and were buried with Him. Third, we are “united with him in his resurrection”  (verse 5). Following Him through death and burial, we move out into His resurrection life, sharing His life with Him. The practical, successive consequences of this identification with Jesus in His death, burial, and resurrection are as follows: 1.  “The body of sin [is]  done away with”  (verse 6). The corrupt, evil nature that enslaved us and made us do wrong even when we desired to do right is rendered powerless. It has been put to death.\n2. Consequently, we are “no longer…slaves to sin”  (verse 6). Sin no longer compels us to do harmful, destructive things that will ultimately bring disaster upon us, on earth and in eternity.\n3. Then, we are “ freed from sin”  (verse 7). We are literally justified, or acquitted. Jesus paid the final penalty for our sin; there is no more to pay. Having been released from the power and guilt of sin, we now have good consciences and can stand before the throne of almighty God without fear.\n4. Finally, “we will also live with him [Christ] ”  (verse 8). What a tremendous promise! We will share His eternal resurrection life.\nHe died once to sin; He cannot die again. He lives forever to God, and we enter into that eternal life. ',

Paul said,  “I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me”  (Galatians 2:20). Paul saw Christ’s crucifixion and death as his own. He thought that way and talked that way, reckoning it true. We must do the same.\nSteps two and three are negative admonitions: “Do not let sin reign in your mortal body”  (verse 12) and “Do not offer the parts of your body to sin” (verse 13). Before, we could not help yielding to sin; now, we have a choice. There is a power in us greater than sin. We have been liberated, justified. However, we must exercise our wills. When temptation comes, we must firmly and finally say, “No! I will not yield my body or my members! I do not yield to you, Satan; I belong to Jesus.”\nStep four is positive: “Offer yourselves to God”  (verse 13). We cannot be independent agents and remain free from sin. We must choose to serve God rather than Satan, offering ourselves as sacrifices to God, giving all we are and all we have—holding nothing back. Next, Paul said, “Offer the parts of your body to him [God] ” (verse 13). Yield every part of your body to God for Him to use as He wants for His glory.\nThe result is that “sin shall not be your master”  (verse 14). We are set free from shame, degradation, agony—all the evils sin brings.

In this picture, the outer circle represents God’s complete provision for every area of our lives—spiritual, physical, and financial, for time and through eternity.\nThe spokes that support the outermost circle of the wheel are ways in which God makes provision. For instance, He makes provision through forgiveness (peace), healing (health), deliverance (liberty), sanctification (holiness), and so forth. Now, without the central hub, the spokes have nothing to support them. Also, through the hub comes the driving power to turn the wheel. In God’s provision, the atonement is the center hub, supplying the power for the Christian life.\nFrom Hebrews 2:9, we learn that by the grace of God, Jesus tasted death for everyone. He took our place; that which was due to us came upon Him. Isaiah 53:6 says, “All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned, every one, to his own way; and the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all” (Isaiah 53:6).\n“Iniquity”  also means “rebellion.” The rebellion of the entire human race is summed up in that phrase. We have turned our backs on God and gone our own ways—set our own standards, pleased ourselves, lived for ourselves. We have been rebellious, but the Lord placed on Jesus the rebellion of us all; all of our rebellion was concentrated on Him. As He hung on the cross, all the evil consequences of our rebellion came upon Him: sickness, rejection, pain, agony, and, finally, death. But He did not die for Himself. He died our deaths. He tasted death in our place.\nThank You, Jesus, for Your work on the cross. I proclaim that I turn from my rebellion, and that Jesus tasted death in my place— ',

By oppression and judgment He was taken away; and as for His generation, who considered that He was cut off out of the land of the living, for the transgression of my people to whom the stroke was due? His grave was assigned with wicked men, yet He was with a rich man in His death, because He had done no violence, nor was there any deceit in His mouth.\n(Isaiah 53:7–9 nasb)\nThese details were accurately fulfilled in the sufferings and death of Jesus. First, the Gospels emphasized several times that Jesus made no attempt to answer His accusers, justify Himself, or plead His own cause. (See, for example, Mark 15:3–5.) Unjust accusation and an unfair trial led to His death, and “He was cut off out of the land of the living.”\nThe details of His burial are also amazingly accurate: “His grave was assigned with wicked men, yet He was with a rich man in His death.”\nWe move from the plural “with wicked men”  to the singular  “a rich man.”  Historically, we find that Jesus was taken down for burial with two thieves who were hung on either side of Him, but then He was buried in the tomb of a rich man, Joseph of Arimathea.\nIsaiah emphasizes that it was not for His own sin or guilt that Jesus died.

    "body": 'Let’s look at some Scriptures that speak about how Christ identified Himself with the human race and expiated its guilt.\nSince the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of death—that is, the devil—and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.\n(Hebrews 2:14–15 niv)\nWhen Adam rebelled, instead of being a king, he became a slave—\nbound by Satan, death, and corruption. He was no longer free. But in order to deliver human beings from that slavery, Jesus took upon Himself the form of humanity, the Adamic nature. He took upon Himself the same flesh and blood that you and I have so that by His death, He might destroy the one who holds the power of death—that is, the devil—and free all those of us who all our lives were held in slavery by the fear of death. On the cross, Jesus took upon Himself the fallen nature of human beings and their sins. This is also stated in 1 Peter 2:24:  “He himself [Jesus]  bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed” (niv).\nOn the cross, Jesus became completely identified with our sin and our guilt. He became the last great guilt offering that took away the sin and guilt of the human race. He bore our sin and our punishment. Our wounds became His wounds, and He died our deaths. He expiated that guilt of rebellion as our representative, the last Adam, hanging on the cross, shedding His lifeblood, giving Himself totally to redeem us. ',

    "body": 'Looking beyond Christ’s identification with us, we find that, in turn, through faith and repentance, we can be identified with Christ—not only in His death, but also in His subsequent exaltation.\nBut because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you have been saved. And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus.\n(Ephesians 2:4–6 niv)\nThis is the opposite side of identification. First, Jesus identified Himself with us, the fallen race. He took our place, paid our penalty, and died our death. He expiated our guilt. Then, as we identify ourselves with Him and His death in faith, we are also identified with Him in all that follows His death. Three great steps of our identification with Jesus are stated in Ephesians 2:4–6. First, “God…made us alive with Christ.”  Second,  “God raised us up with Christ.”  He resurrected us with Christ. But it doesn’t stop there. Third, “God…seated us with Him in the heavenly realms.”  God seated us with Christ on His throne. He enthroned us in Christ.\nNotice those three upward steps of identification with Jesus: we are made alive with Him, resurrected with Him, and enthroned with Him.\nThe way up is down; from the lowest, we go to the highest. God exalts the lowest to the highest, and this principle runs all through Scripture.\nIt is not just a matter of history but the outworking of a universal law: Whoever humbles himself will be exalted. Whoever exalts himself will be humbled. (See Matthew 23:12 niv.) ',

    "body": 'When we are first confronted with the cross, we tend to recoil. But the cross of Jesus is the door to a secret place that no animal can find, no bird can see, and all the rest of creation does not know. (See Job 28:7–8.) It is in the spiritual realm. Paul said, Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.\n(Colossians 3:1–4 niv)\nThe key phrase, “your life is now hidden with Christ in God,”  is not talking about the next world, but the here and now. Being hidden with Christ in God means being in the secret place. The secret is that when Jesus died, He did not die for Himself; He died for us as our representative, taking our guilt and condemnation on Himself.\nBased on our understanding by faith in Scripture, we know that when Jesus died and was raised, we died and were raised. We passed through death into a realm the senses cannot discern and creatures do not perceive. We are in Christ, and we are in God; nothing can reach us unless it comes through God and through Christ. We are here in the flesh, but our lives are not in this visible world. We may go through many difficulties and pressures in these clay vessels, but we have a life that is eternal, incorruptible, and indestructible. This is total security.\nNo matter what comes, in Christ we are in the secret place of the Most High, protected from all harm and all danger. (See Psalm 91:1–2.) And the door to the secret place is the cross.\nThank You, Jesus, for Your work on the cross. I proclaim that by the cross, I have entered into the secret place of the Most High. ',

    "body": 'Jesus called Himself the “good shepherd”  (John 10:11, 14). The shepherd’s provision, as illustrated in Psalm 23, can be summed up in one tremendous phrase: total security. But remember that all provision is measured by our commitment. When our commitment is total, our security is total. If there are limits to our commitment, then we do not enjoy the total security Jesus offers.\nWe can reinforce this Old Testament illustration by looking at the words of Jesus in the New Testament: “The thief comes only to steal, and kill, and destroy; I came that they might have life, and might have it abundantly” (John 10:10 nasb). Jesus was telling us the reason that He came to earth. He summed it up in a simple phrase: that we “might have life.”  Not life in a small or limited way, but life “abundantly.”  Life overflowing. Life for every area of our being. Life more than sufficient for every challenge and every pressure that comes against us.\nThen, a little further on, Jesus used the phrase, “eternal life” : My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me; and I give eternal life to them, and they shall never perish; and no one shall snatch them out of My hand. (John 10:27–28 nasb) Notice the central phrases: “I give eternal life to them, and they shall never perish.”  By this passage, we see that Jesus came so that we might have eternal life, a life that stretches beyond this world. A life that goes beyond the grave. A life that lasts for eternity. I once heard somebody make this insightful comment: “I believe that I shall live as long as God lives because God has become my life.” That is the kind of life that Jesus came to offer us. His life—eternally. ',

    "body": 'We all like sheep have gone astray; we have turned, every one, to his own way.\n(Isaiah 53:6)\nThis passage can be summarized in one word: rebellion. It is the common sin of all humanity. The prophet continued, “And the Lord has laid on Him [Jesus]  the iniquity of us all” (verse 6). The word iniquity (Hebrew, avon) means “rebellion,” “the punishment for rebellion,”\nand “all the evil consequences of rebellion.” On the cross, Jesus—our substitute, the last Adam—became the rebel with our rebellion and endured all the evil consequences of rebellion.\nThis is the door to God’s treasure house, if we can grasp it. This is the exchange: All the evil our rebellion deserved came upon Jesus so that all the good He deserved—because of His perfect obedience—\nmight be offered to us. In whatever way we look at that exchange, it was total. Jesus was punished so that we might be forgiven. He was wounded so that we might be healed. He bore our sin so that we might share His righteousness. He died our death so that we might share His life. He was made a curse so that we might receive the blessing. He endured our poverty so that we might share His abundance. He bore our shame so that we might have His glory. He endured our rejection so that we might have His acceptance.\nJust picture the rebel on the cross and know that you are that rebel—indeed, you should be hanging there. But Jesus took your place.\nHe not only bore your rebellion, but also bore all its evil consequences so that you might enter into all the blessings of His perfect obedience.\nThat is grace at work. You cannot earn it, you did not deserve it, and you had no claim upon it. There is only one way to receive it, and that is by faith. Just believe. ',

    "body": 'Jesus was made a curse that we might enter into the blessing.\nChrist was made a curse on the cross so that we might qualify for and receive the blessing. In order to receive this provision God has made for us, it is necessary that we understand the nature of blessings and curses. If we do not understand these two concepts, we will not be able to avail ourselves of God’s provision.\nBoth blessings and curses are major themes of Scripture. The word\n“bless”  or “blessing”  occurs more than 410 times in the Bible; the word curse occurs nearly 160 times. In other words, the Bible has a great deal to say about both. Both are absolutely real—so real that Jesus had to be made a curse so that we might be redeemed from the curse and receive the blessing.\nSome people are inclined to think that blessings are real but curses are imaginary, or hypothetical. That is an illogical idea. If we consider any pair of opposites, it stands to reason that if one is real, the other must be real. Take day and night, for example. If day is real, then night is also real. Heat and cold—if heat is real, then cold is real. Good and evil—if good is real, then evil is real. We cannot accept one and ignore the other. So it is with blessings and curses. Blessings are real, and so are curses.\nThe Bible has much to teach us about the nature of blessings and curses, how they operate, how to recognize a curse at work in your life, and how to be delivered. If we remain ignorant, it will be to our own cost. We will miss much of the total provision that God has made for us through the sacrificial death of Jesus on the cross if we fail to understand His exchange of blessing for curse. ',

Our Scripture for today is Galatians 3:13–14: Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a curse for us—for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree”—in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.\n(nasb)\nPaul was referring here to the law of Moses, detailed in the book of Deuteronomy, where God said that everyone who is put to death by hanging on a tree is under a curse. (The word tree also signifies a piece of wood that makes a cross.) The evidence that such a person is under the curse is that he is hanging visibly on a piece of wood.\nIn order to redeem us from the curse of the law, Christ became a curse for us. This was demonstrated visibly when He hung on the cross.\nIt was necessary for Him to become a curse because the curse of God follows all sin and disobedience against God.\nThe secret of what took place on the cross is that there was a divinely ordained exchange—something that could not be seen by the natural eye, but could be perceived only through the revelation of God through the Holy Spirit and the Scriptures. Christ became a curse—He took the curse due to our sin and disobedience—so that we, in return, through faith in Him, might have access to the blessing that was due to His sinless obedience.\nThank You, Jesus, for Your work on the cross.

The essential feature of curses and blessings alike in the Bible is that they are passed down from generation to generation unless something happens to cut them off. I have dealt with people whose problems went back hundreds of years in family history.\nOn the basis of my personal observation, here are seven indications that usually signify the presence of a curse over your life or your family.\nIf you experience only one of these, I would not say for sure there is a curse. But if several of them show up in your family, in different areas and in multiple generations, you can be almost sure that a curse is in place. These indications are the following: (1) mental and emotional breakdown; (2) repeated or chronic sicknesses, especially if they are hereditary; (3) repeated miscarriages or related female problems; (4) breakdown of marriage and family alienation, especially a family history of them; (5) financial insufficiency, if it is ongoing; (6) being known as “accident-prone”; and (7) having a family a history of suicides or unnatural deaths.\nWe will not dwell on the problem, but we will affirm the solution.\nJesus was made a curse that we might enter into the blessing.

We do not need to speculate about that, because it is specifically revealed in Scripture.\nNow Abraham was old, well advanced in age; and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things.\n(Genesis 24:1)\nThis verse might give you the impression that Abraham was hobbling around with a cane, but it just says that he was “well advanced in age.”  It is pretty obvious that he was not hobbling around with a cane because, quite a number of years later, he made a long journey to Mount Moriah and came back again.\nWhat is “the blessing of Abraham” ?

The story tells how Abraham obtained a bride for his son Isaac. It is a very simple but beautiful parable with four main characters, three of whom are the following: Abraham, who represents God the Father; Isaac, Abraham’s son, who represents God’s only begotten Son, Jesus; and Rebekah, the bride, who represents the church (the bride of Christ). There is one other individual, and he is, in a sense, the main character. That character is the nameless servant, who represents the Holy Spirit. If we read the chapter with those personalities in mind, it will reveal almost limitless truths to us.\nNotice that at the beginning of the chapter, it says that everything that Abraham owned was under the control of the servant. He was the administrator of the entire estate of Abraham the father and Isaac the son. That is true of the Holy Spirit, too; He is the administrator of the entire wealth of the Godhead. We are heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ. But the administrator of our inheritance is the Holy Spirit. Apart from the Holy Spirit, we cannot receive or enjoy our inheritance.\nWhen the Bible speaks about our inheritance as the children of Abraham, it refers specifically to receiving the promise of the Spirit, who alone can bring us into all the blessings that are our inheritance.\nThe blessing of Abraham is “in all things”  (Genesis 24:1), but the administrator of the blessing is the Holy Spirit. Hence Paul’s specific mention in Galatians of receiving the promise of the Spirit.\nThank You, Jesus, for Your work on the cross.

It is through faith, not by works,\n“that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith”  (Galatians 3:14).This idea agrees with Jesus’ final charge to His disciples just before His ascension: “Behold, I send the Promise of My Father upon you; but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high”  (Luke 24:49). Jesus was speaking about the baptism in the Holy Spirit that the disciples would receive at Pentecost.\nThe phrase “the Promise of My Father”  gives us wonderful insight into the mind and purpose of God the Father concerning the gift of the Holy Spirit. Someone conservatively estimated that the Bible contains seven thousand distinct promises given by God to His believing people.\nBut among these, Jesus singled out just one from all the rest as being unique: the promise of the Spirit.\nPaul called this “the blessing of Abraham”  (Galatians 3:14), thus linking it with the supreme purpose of God in choosing Abraham for Himself. When God first called Abraham out of Ur, He said, “I will bless you…; and you shall be a blessing.…And in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed” (Genesis 12:2–3). In subsequent dealings with Abraham, God reaffirmed His purpose many times. “I will bless you….In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed”  (Genesis 22:17–18). All these promises of God looked forward to Paul’s words:\n“the promise of the Spirit” (Galatians 3:14). Jesus shed His blood on the cross to purchase this blessing, promised to the seed of Abraham.

He planted his potatoes, and a week later, he went outside to see if they were growing. There was no sign of growth. Two weeks later, he still saw nothing, so he dug them up to see if they were sprouting at all. In the end, he dug them up three or four times, and they never grew!\nSome Christians are like that little boy. They plant their potatoes of faith, then dig them up to see if they are growing. The essence of faith is to let God grow us. We meet the conditions, but God fulfills the promise and blesses us. Deuteronomy 28:2 says to those who meet God’s conditions, “All these blessings shall come upon you and overtake you, because you obey the voice of the Lord your God.”  I love the word\n“overtake.”  It is not for us to run after the blessings; they run after us.\nWe can go to bed at night and ponder what blessings will have caught up with us by the time we wake up in the morning!\nIn the same way, Matthew 6:33 tells us, “But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.”\nWe do not seek the “things”; we seek the kingdom. Then, God adds all the things we need.\nThese, then, are the conditions for receiving God’s abundance: first, our motives and attitudes must be right; second, we must exercise faith; third, we must honor God, our parents, and God’s ministers by giving; fourth, we must practice right thinking, speaking, and acting; and fifth, we must let God add in His way and His time.

While I continued to stand before the people and speak to them, I was having an inner mental vision of Jesus on the cross. I saw Him there in all the stark reality Scripture describes. The Holy Spirit went over the four aspects of the poverty curse for me, one by one, showing me that Jesus totally exhausted the curse in all its aspects.\nFirst, He was hungry—when He was taken to be crucified, He had not eaten for nearly twenty-four hours. Second, He was thirsty—“I thirst” was one of His last utterances. Third, He was naked—the Roman soldiers had stripped Him of all His clothing and divided it among themselves. Fourth, He was in want of all things—He had no robe to wear while He died, nor did He own a tomb to be buried in afterward.\nJesus had nothing. Why? Because in the divine purpose of God, He exhausted the poverty curse on our behalf. At first, I did not realise the full implication of what the Holy Spirit was showing me. Looking back, however, I would have to say that this revelation has given me the basis for my faith for prosperity. In the absolute finality of the exchange, Jesus took the poverty curse so that we might receive the blessing of Abraham, whom God blessed “in all things” (Genesis 24:1), which is administered by the Holy Spirit.

    "body": 'Many passages of Scripture support the fact that Jesus bore the poverty curse. Let us look at two in particular, starting with 2 Corinthians 8:9: “For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich” (kjv). I used to quote the end of that verse as “might become  rich”! But the Holy Spirit showed me that it means\n“might be  rich.” We can become rich and then become poor again, but to “be”  rich has a sense of permanence. Jesus took the evil—poverty—\nso that we might have the good—riches. Jesus took our poverty so that we might have His wealth.\nSome people suggest that Jesus was poor throughout His earthly ministry, but I cannot accept this idea as accurate. We need to keep in mind the distinction between riches and  abundance. Jesus was not rich in the sense of having a large bank account or great material possessions, but He certainly had abundance. Any man who can provide food for a crowd of five thousand men (along with women and children) is no pauper! Actually, Jesus had much more left over after feeding about twelve thousand people than He had when He started. (See Matthew 14:15–21.) What a beautiful picture of abundance!\nFurthermore, Jesus transmitted this abundance to His disciples.\nWhen He sent them out to spread the gospel message, He told them to take nothing extra with them. Yet their testimony afterwards was that they had lacked nothing. (See Luke 22:35.) That is not poverty!\nJesus was never worried or perplexed. He was calmly and completely in control of every situation. He never doubted that His Father’s goodness would provide everything He needed. And the Father never failed Him. ',

    "body": 'Having poverty means having “hunger,…thirst,…nakedness,…and\n[being]  in need of everything”  (Deuteronomy 28:48). When exactly did Jesus become poor? He began to become poor the moment He was identified with our sins. From that moment onward, He went deeper and deeper into poverty until, on the cross, He represented the absolute poverty described above.\nUnderstand that at the cross, His poverty was not merely spiritual.\nHe was also physically and materially poor. Therefore, by all the laws of logic, our wealth will not be merely spiritual, either. Jesus became absolutely poor in the physical, material sense so that we might become rich, having every physical and material need met—and having something leftover to share with other people.\nSecond Corinthians 9:8 is the second particular verse we will study that supports the fact that Jesus bore the poverty curse: “God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that you, always having all sufficiency in all things, may have an abundance for every [all]  good work.”  God is not stingy. He does not give just enough; He gives enough and more.\nThat is abundance. In the verse above, there are two instances of the word abound  and four instances of the word all. I don’t know if this language could be any clearer. What does it describe? God’s grace.\nInterestingly enough, in 2 Corinthians 8 and 9, two chapters that deal with money, the key word is grace.  It occurs seven times in chapter 8 and twice in chapter 9. It is a grace that operates in the realm of money. However, few professing Christians understand the nature of God’s grace. I have sometimes observed that those who speak the most about “grace” often understand it the least. ',

    "body": 'There are three basic principles that govern the operation of God’s grace. First, grace can never be earned; conversely, anything that can be earned is not grace:\nAnd if by grace, then it is no longer of works [what we earn] ; otherwise grace is no longer grace. But if it is of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work. (Romans 11:6) This principle excludes most “religious” people from the grace of God, because they think they can earn it.\nSecond, there is only one channel of grace. “For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ”\n(John 1:17). Any form of grace that comes to us comes solely through Jesus Christ.\nThird, there is only one means by which we can appropriate God’s grace, and that is faith. This truth is summed up in three successive phrases in Ephesians 2:8–9: “For by grace you have been saved through faith,…not of works [what we earn] .”\nFew Christians realise that this principle applies just as much in the realm of financial and material provision as it does in any other area of our lives. Scripture warns us specifically against irresponsibility (Proverbs 10:4), laziness (Proverbs 24:30–34), and dishonesty (Ephesians 4:28). As long as we are guilty of any of these sinful behaviors, we have no right to expect God’s grace to work in the financial aspect of our lives. Therefore, as Christians, we are obligated to be honest, hard working, and responsible. ',

    "body": 'We must make an important, logical distinction between earning God’s grace,  which is impossible, and meeting God’s conditions, which is obligatory. We cannot earn  God’s abundance, which comes only through grace; however, we are required to meet the conditions God has laid down for receiving His abundance through faith. If we do not meet these conditions, our faith has no scriptural foundation. In fact, it is merely presumption. To meet God’s conditions, our motives and attitudes must be right. We would all do well to examine our motives very carefully, especially concerning monetary gain. Impure motives concerning money include: (1) idolizing wealth ( “Covetousness…is idolatry” [Colossians 3:5]; “The love of money is a root of all kinds of evil”  [1 Timothy 6:10]); (2) pursuing wealth by sinful methods ( “Like a partridge that hatches eggs it did not lay is the man who gains riches by unjust means” [Jeremiah 17:11 niv]; [see also Proverbs 28:8]); (3) trusting ultimately in wealth for security and well-being  ( “He who trusts in his riches will fall”  [Proverbs 11:28]; “Let not…the rich man glory in his riches” [Jeremiah 9:23]); (4) using wealth for selfish gain and self-serving interests ( “There is one who withholds more than is right, but it leads to poverty” [Proverbs 11:24].) In Luke 12:16–21, Jesus related the parable of the rich man who built bigger barns and filled them with his produce. But the Lord said to him, “Fool! This night your soul will be required of you”  (verse 20).\nJesus then added, “So is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God” (verse 21). The first direction in which we need to be rich is toward God, giving Him our tithes and offerings for the building of His kingdom. ',

The Bible consistently warns us against despising or exploiting the poor.\nThere are a multitude of Scripture verses on this subject, but we will look at several verses from Proverbs:\nHe who despises his neighbor sins; but he who has mercy on the poor, happy is he.\n(Proverbs 14:21)\nHe who has pity on the poor lends to the Lord, and He will pay back what he has given.\n(Proverbs 19:17)\nWhoever shuts his ears to the cry of the poor will also cry himself and not be heard.\n(Proverbs 21:13)\nHe who gives to the poor will not lack, but he who hides his eyes will have many curses.\n(Proverbs 28:27)\nThe righteous considers the cause of the poor, but the wicked does not understand such knowledge.\n(Proverbs 29:7)\nThese verses—and others like them—place a tremendous responsibility upon us to have concern for the needs of the poor. One mark of righteousness is considering the cause of the poor. Conversely, a mark of wickedness is simply averting one’s eyes from the plight of the poor. Furthermore, a reward is promised in relation to caring for the poor. When we give to the poor, Solomon told us, we are lending to the Lord.

    "body": 'Shame is a cruel and ugly emotion, and it is found even among Christians. It is often the result of sexual abuse or emotional abuse, such as being ridiculed at school. I once read a story about a headmaster who singled out one boy and told him to stand up, then said to the whole class, “All of you have passed your exams except him.” How could this young man feel anything but shame? Many experiences of childhood can cause shame. Those that happened longest ago are sometimes the hardest to uproot. First in is often last out.\nPerhaps the most common source of shame in our Western civilization is sexual abuse (even by professing Christians). I have dealt with countless victims in this regard. Only when they come to the cross will they be set free from that shame.\nThis prophetic utterance describes what Jesus did for us: The Lord God has opened My ear; and I [Jesus] was not rebellious, nor did I turn away. I gave My back to those who struck Me, and My cheeks to those who plucked out the beard; I did not hide My face from shame and spitting.\n(Isaiah 50:5–6)\nJesus said, “I gave My back.” He could have saved Himself; He could have called for twelve legions of angels to rescue Him. (See Matthew 26:53.) But He did not. He gave His back. The depictions we see of the scourging of Jesus have very little to do with our own familiar reality. It was a horrible scene because the scourge had little pieces of metal or bone embedded in the thongs. When they fell on a man’s body, they tore away the skin and exposed the raw flesh. That is what Jesus endured for our sake. And He did not hide His face from shame and spitting. On the cross, Jesus bore our shame. ',

Pontius Pilate had handed Jesus over to the soldiers to take Him out to be executed.\nThen the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole garrison around Him. And they stripped Him and put a scarlet robe on Him. When they had twisted a crown of thorns, they put it on His head, and a reed in His right hand. And they bowed the knee before Him and mocked Him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” Then they spat on Him, and took the reed and struck Him on the head. [Remember, every blow of that reed pressed the crown of thorns deeper into His skull.]\nAnd when they had mocked Him, they took the robe off Him, put His own clothes on Him, and led Him away to be crucified….\nThen they crucified Him, and divided His garments, casting lots, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet: “They divided My garments among them, and for My clothing they cast lots.” Sitting down, they kept watch over Him there.\n(Matthew 27:27–31, 35–36)\nJesus was actually exposed naked two times in that scene. And they sat and watched Him on the cross for three hours. Most depictions of Jesus on the cross show Him wearing a little loincloth. But there was no loincloth; He was exposed naked. His shame was exposed to everybody who passed by, mocking Him.\nThe epistle to the Hebrews emphasizes this truth: “Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith,…for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame” (Hebrews 12:2).\nThank You, Jesus, for Your work on the cross.

He bore our shame so that we might share His glory. Some of us have backgrounds of which we are ashamed—filled with things we have never fully gotten over, events that haunt and disturb us. These negative thoughts and painful memories hinder those moments when we want to worship and praise God. Just remember that Jesus, naked for three hours on the cross, bore our shame completely so that we might share His glory.\nI once spoke in Holland about Jesus bearing our shame, and a Dutch woman sent me her testimony as a response. As a young girl, she had been sexually abused—gang raped by a group of young boys—and also suffered further sexual molestation. Later, she married, but her marriage was not happy because of the deep bitterness in her heart against men. She could not escape the shame of what she had endured.\nThen, the Lord did something wonderful.\nSitting alone in her bedroom, she had a vision of Jesus on the cross, absolutely naked. She realised two things: first, that He had borne her shame; and second, that He was a man. Though she was so bitter against men, she realised it was a Man who paid the penalty of her shame.\nIsn’t that beautiful?

That is His faithfulness—not our cleverness.\nHebrews 12:2 continues, saying that Jesus, “ for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.”  On the cross, Jesus endured shame, but He did not let it deter Him. For the joy that was set before Him, He did not consider shame a worthy reason to turn away from His purpose. What was “the joy that was set before Him” ? The joy of bringing many sons to glory. In order to bring you and me—and millions and millions of others like us—to glory, Jesus Christ endured the shame of the cross.\nThere is no form of death more shameful than crucifixion. It is shameful because it is the lowest form of punishment reserved for the most debased of criminals. It is shameful because of the very way in which the death occurs. The Scriptures state clearly that the Roman soldiers took all of Jesus’ clothing away from Him.

These three ways of reacting to rejection have one thing in common. Each is essentially defensive, offering a method of covering up the hurt. None of them is a positive solution. God, however, has a positive solution.\nIn Isaiah 61:1, we find a promise that was fulfilled through the coming of Jesus the Messiah: “The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord has anointed me to bring good news to the afflicted; He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to captives, and freedom to prisoners” (nasb).\nIn fulfillment of this promise, God has provided a remedy for rejection. It comes to us through Jesus and the cross. God’s eternal purpose, even before creation, was that we might become His children—\nHis sons and His daughters. When Jesus bore our sin and suffered our rejection, He opened the way for our acceptance by the One whose acceptance truly matters. ',

    "body": 'The first step in overcoming rejection is to recognize the problem.\nOnce you recognize it, you can deal with it. You are not alone in this; God will help you recognize it. Let me give you a practical illustration.\nDuring World War II, when I was serving as a medical orderly in the desert in North Africa, I was working with a man who was a brilliant doctor. One of our soldiers was struck with a piece of shrapnel.\nHe came into the medical station with this tiny, black puncture mark in his shoulder. I set to work attending to him, and I asked the doctor,\n“Shall I get out a dressing to dress the wound?”\nThe doctor said, “No, give me the probe.” So, I handed him the little silver stick, and he put it in the wound and moved it around.\nNothing happened for a few moments. Suddenly, the probe touched the little piece of shrapnel inside, and the patient let out a yelp. The doctor knew he had found the problem.\nWhen I again asked if I should bring the dressing, the doctor replied, “No, bring me the forceps.” He put the forceps in and removed the piece of shrapnel. Only then did he want to apply the dressing.\nYou may be putting a little dressing of religion over a wound that cannot heal because there is something inside that is causing it to fester.\nHowever, if you will open your heart to the Holy Spirit, He will reveal the source of the problem. If the Holy Spirit’s probe touches a piece of shrapnel, yelp if you must, but don’t resist! Ask Him to use His forceps to remove the problem. Then, God can apply something that will truly heal the wound rather than patch it up temporarily. ',

    "body": 'To receive God’s provision for rejection, you must grasp two basic facts. First, God did not make a lot of different provisions for each of the various needs of humanity. Instead, He made just one, all-inclusive provision that covers all the needs of all people. This cover-all provision was the sacrificial death of Jesus on the cross.\nSecond, what took place on the cross was an exchange that God Himself had planned. All the evil consequences of our sins came upon Jesus so that, in return, all the benefits of Jesus’ sinless obedience might be made available to us. For our part, we have done nothing to deserve this, and we have no merits or rights by which to claim it. It proceeded solely out of the unfathomable love of God.\nTherefore, it is futile to approach God on the basis of some merit or virtue that we imagine we possess. Nothing we have to offer of ourselves can be compared with the merit of the sacrifice that Jesus offered on our behalf.\nChrist bore our rejection on the cross, along with all of the shame and betrayal, agony and heartache. In fact, a broken heart was the cause of His death. We are accepted because of His rejection. We are accepted in the Beloved. It was an exchange. Jesus bore the evil so that we might receive the good. He carried our sorrows so we might have His joy.\nThe way is opened for man to come to God without shame, without guilt, without fear. Jesus bore our rejection so that we might experience His acceptance. ',

    "body": 'There are four steps you must take to experience acceptance with God. The first thing is to forgive every person who has rejected you or harmed you in any way. As Jesus instructed us,  “When you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins” (Mark 11:25 niv).\nThis statement is all-inclusive: if you hold anything against anyone, forgive, and then God will forgive you. But if you do not forgive others, God does not forgive you. This truth applies especially in our attitudes toward our parents, who most commonly cause the problem of rejection. Lives have changed when people have realised they have a scriptural obligation to honor their parents. Ephesians 6:2 says,\n“‘Honor your father and mother,’ which is the first commandment with a promise.”  That does not mean that you ignore their faults completely, but you must forgive them and determine to honor them to the greatest extent that you are able. I have never known anyone who had a wrong relation to his parents who was really blessed and prosperous.\nSecond, you must lay down the negative results of rejection: bitterness, resentment, hatred, rebellion. These attitudes are poisonous; they will infect your entire life. They will cause deep emotional problems and, quite likely, physical problems, as well. You cannot afford to entertain these thoughts.\nBy a resolute decision of your will, push them from you. Say with conviction, “I lay down bitterness, resentment, hatred, and rebellion.”\nPeople who have recovered from alcoholism are often told, “Resentment is a luxury you can no longer afford.” That is true. None of us can afford resentment. Its effects are toxic. ',

Scripture tells us that God’s purpose from eternity was to make us His children, and He accomplished this purpose, He made it possible, through Jesus’ death on the cross on our behalf. (See Ephesians 1:4–6.) When you come to God through Jesus, God accepts you. He will not turn you away.\nTo make this step toward acceptance, you must accept yourself.\nMany times, this is the hardest thing for us to do. We look back over a record of failures and false starts, maybe the ways in which we have failed others. You may label yourself “failure,” but God labels you “My son” or “My daughter.” We must accept ourselves because God has accepted us.\nWhen you come to God through Jesus, you are a new creation: “If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new. Now all things are of God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ”  (2 Corinthians 5:17–18).\nThat is the new creation. Do not think about yourself in terms of what you were before you came to Christ, for you have become a new creation.\nLet us pray together: “God, I thank You that You love me, that You gave Jesus, Your Son, to die on my behalf. I thank You that He bore my sins, took my rejection, and paid my penalty. And because I come to You through Him, I am not rejected, I am not unwanted, I am not excluded. You really love me.

This means finding your place in the body of Christ.\nYou see, as Christians, we are never isolated individuals. We are brought into a relationship with our fellow believers. That relationship is one of the ways in which our acceptance is worked out in our day-to-day living. It is not enough to be accepted by the Father in heaven.\nThat is the first step, and indeed the most important one. However, after that, acceptance has to find expression in our relationships with our fellow believers.\nCollectively, Christians constitute one body, with each Christian being a member of that body. None of us can say to our fellow believers,\n“I don’t need you.” We all need one another. God has created the body in such a way that the members are interdependent. None of them can function effectively on its own. That principle applies to each one of us.\nIt applies to you. You have to find your place in the body of Christ. You need the other members, and they need you. Finding your place in the body makes your acceptance a real, day-to-day experience.\nIf you are crying out in your heart for this kind of involvement, I suggest that you pray this prayer: “Lord, I long to dwell in Your house, to be part of a spiritual family of committed believers. If there are any barriers in me, I ask You to remove them. Guide me to a group where this longing of mine can be fulfilled, and help me to make the needed commitment to them.

In fact, the bitterest dregs came after physical death. In every sense, Jesus exhausted the cup. First, there was spiritual death; second, physical death; and third, spiritual banishment from God.\nJesus tasted death for every person so that we might have life. And we have life in the three aspects of life that Jesus forfeited. The parallel is exact.\nFirst of all, we have spiritual life—we are brought into union and fellowship with God here in this life, right now, through faith in Jesus Christ. Jesus was joined to the Lord; He lived by the life of the Father.\nHe said,  “I and My Father are one”  (John 10:30). This was the case until He took our iniquity upon Himself and was separated from the Father.\nHe was cut off that we might be united. Through faith in Jesus, you and I can be joined to the Lord in the Spirit and walk this life in union with God, just as Jesus walked His life in union with the Father by the Spirit.\nThis is the end purpose of the gospel.\nFirst John 1:3 states,  “That which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that you also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.”  Jesus forfeited the fellowship so that we might enter into the fellowship.

It is a continuing present: “He who is cleaving continually to the Lord.” Jesus lived by continual union with the Father. If the union had ever been broken, which it never was until the cross, He would have forfeited life. And you and I, as believers, live only insofar as we live in continual union with the Son, Jesus Christ.

The whole essence of the law is that we are required to keep it in our own ability. Doing this is dependent on our fleshly nature, which explains why it never works.\nComing under the law is like participating in a marriage ceremony in which you are married to your fleshly nature. As long as your fleshly nature remains alive, you must remain married to it; you cannot divorce it and marry somebody else. The good news is that your first spouse died. When did that first spouse die? When Jesus died on the cross.\nOur old man was crucified with Him. When you grasp that fact, you say, “Praise God. I’m free. I don’t have to go on with this awful spouse of mine who gave me an awful life and gave me no blessings, peace, or righteousness. I’m not tied to that vile spouse any longer. I can be married to another.”\nThe alternative is to be married to the One who rose from the dead—the risen, glorified Christ. He can become your husband whether you are man or woman. What we are talking about is a relationship in the Spirit. In 1 Corinthians 6:15–16, Paul provided a picture of sexual union between a man and a prostitute. He used that picture of union to help people envision another kind of union that they can have—a union with the Lord. It is not sexual; it is spiritual—that is, a marriage relationship with the Lord. “He who is joined to the Lord is one”\n(1 Corinthians 6:17)—not in soul or in body, but in spirit. ',

If I may say this without offending anybody, worship is the consummation of our marriage to the Lord. It unites us with Him as one spirit.

Notice that word domain. In the original Greek, it is authority. Satan has authority over the disobedient, the unbelieving, and the unsaved. But through Jesus, God has delivered us from that domain of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love, in whom we have redemption.\nNote the key word redemption. We have been bought back. We are no longer under the power of the curse, because of the redeeming death and shed blood of Jesus Christ.\nFor this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil.\n(1 John 3:8)\nWhy did Jesus come? To destroy the works of the devil. That includes the curse!\nBehold, I give you the authority to trample on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you.\n(Luke 10:19)\nSatan may have power, but Jesus has given us power over the power of Satan, so that “nothing shall by any means hurt [us] .” ',

    "body": 'Providing complete deliverance from the tyranny of sin required a threefold provision of God. First of all, He had to deal with our sins—\nthe sinful acts we have all committed. Because Jesus paid the full penalty for our sins on the cross, God can forgive us without compromising His own justice. His first provision, therefore, is forgiveness.\nThen, God also had to deal with the corrupt nature within us that caused us to go on committing those sinful acts. His provision was execution—to put that sinful nature to death. The good news is that the execution took place more than nineteen centuries ago, when Jesus died on the cross.\nThat not the end, however. God’s purpose is to replace the old, sinful man with a new man of His own creating. Paul explained this provision in the book of Ephesians, saying,\nPut off, concerning your former conduct, the old man…and be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and…put on the new man which was created according to God, in true righteousness and holiness.\n(Ephesians 4:22–24)\nWe should not assume, however, that the old man will passively accept his sentence of execution. On the contrary, he will struggle—\nfiercely, at times—to regain his control over us. This explains Paul’s words of warning in Colossians 3:3, where he said,  “For you died.”  Then, in verse 5, he said, “Therefore put to death your members which are on the earth.”  We must stand in faith that the death of our old man is an accomplished fact, and we must actively resist his attempts to regain control over us.

Instead of God doing a lot of different actions at different times, Scripture says, “By one offering [sacrifice]  He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified” (Hebrews 10:14).\nThe writer of Hebrews explained that after Jesus had offered that one sacrifice, He  “sat down at the right hand of God”  (verse 12). Why did He sit down? Because He was never going to have to do it again.\nThrough His work on the cross, Jesus administered to Satan and his kingdom a total, permanent, irreversible defeat. Jesus will never have to do that work again. Satan has already been defeated. You and I do not have to defeat Satan. But we must apply the victory that Jesus has already won and walk in that victory.\nWe read in Colossians 1:12, “Giving thanks to the Father who has qualified us to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in the light.”\nOur inheritance is in the light, and there is no darkness whatsoever in it. It is totally in the light.

    "body": 'In Romans 8:15, Paul was speaking to Christians baptized in the Holy Spirit, and he said, “For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear.”\nBondage means enslavement. Paul was warning Christians not to let the devil get them back into slavery. And the suggestion is very clear that the form of slavery to which they would be enticed to return would be that of religious slavery—subservience to the law from which they had been delivered when Jesus died on the cross.\nThe whole of the book of Galatians deals with this very issue of not being enslaved by religious legalism after having been set free by the gospel and the power of the Holy Spirit. As a matter of fact, Paul treated that issue as something much more severe and dangerous than even sexual sins, such as fornication or adultery. It is quite remarkable, but the epistle to the Galatians is the only one of Paul’s epistles that he does not open by giving thanks to God for the people to whom he was writing. So upset was he by what the Galatians were doing that he launched straight into his subject. “I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who called you in the grace of Christ” (Galatians 1:6).\nThis is a clear example of religious demons bringing people back into the slavery of legalism. Let us heed Paul’s emphatic warning:\n“Be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage [slavery] ”\n(Galatians 5:1 kjv). ',

Percolated coffee takes longer to make because it has to go through the brewing process. The book of Romans is like percolated coffee. We cannot get instant coffee out of Romans chapter 8. We must go through the preceding seven chapters. Those are the percolator. But the result is that much richer. Only when we have been through those chapters do we get to the “therefore.”  The preceding chapters deal with the total sinfulness of all humanity, as well as with the failure of religion to change man’s sinful nature. Using the examples of Abraham and David (see chapter 4), with a comparison between Adam and Christ (see chapter 5), Paul moves on in chapter 6 to reveal God’s remedy for the old man: execution. God doesn’t patch up the old man. He doesn’t reform him. He executes him! The good news is that this execution took place when Jesus died on the cross.\nRomans 7 deals with our relationship to the Law. I always used to think, Why come to the law after all that?  But I have learned that the ultimate hurdle we have to get over, the last stage of this percolator, is how we relate to the Law. Without the percolator, we cannot live in Romans 8, because the essential condition is  “no condemnation.”  The moment in which we come under condemnation is the moment when we are out of the Spirit-controlled life of Romans 8. The devil’s main objective is to bring us under condemnation. The objective of God’s Word, especially in Romans, is to deliver us from condemnation. ',

One day, he took it down to the shore and was sailing it at the edge of the sea, but the tide changed and carried his boat out to sea, and he could not recover it. So, he went home without his boat.\nWith the next change of the wind and tide, the boat came back again. A man walking along the seashore found the boat, picked it up, and saw it was a beautiful piece of work. He took it to a local shop and sold it. The shop owner cleaned it up and put it on display in his shop window with a price of thirty-five dollars.\nSome while later, the boy walked past the shop, looked in the window, and saw his boat with a price of thirty-five dollars. He knew, however, that he had no way to prove that it was his boat. If he wanted his boat, there was only one thing he could do: buy it back.\nHe set to work, taking any job he could to earn the money to buy his boat. Once he earned the money, he walked into the shop and said,\n“I want to buy that boat.” He paid the money, and, when he got the boat in his hands, he walked outside and stopped on the sidewalk. He held the boat to his chest and said, “Now you’re mine. I made you and I bought you.” That is redemption. First, the Lord made us, but we were in Satan’s slave market. Then, He bought us. We are doubly His. Can you see how valuable you are to the Lord? Think of yourself as that boat for a moment. You may feel so inadequate, so worthless. You wonder whether God ever really cares. Just try to believe that you are that boat in the Lord’s arms and He is saying to you, “Now you’re Mine. I made you and I bought you. I own you; you’re fully Mine.” ',

    "body": 'The reason that Jesus Christ came to earth was—and is—to bring us to God. If we stop short of this revelation of God, we have stopped short of the full and final outworking of redemption’s purpose.\nWhen we come into the fullness of this revelation and into that direct relationship with God as Father, it supplies certain factors that are conspicuously lacking in the emotional experience of many people in our culture. The three things that come out of this revelation and relationship are identity, self-worth, and security.\nIdentity is a real problem for people today. An interesting clue to this problem was the success of the book and TV miniseries Roots. The essence of that story was a man’s search for his roots, or origins, in order to gain a stronger sense of identity. All humanity is busy with the same search. Men and women want to know where they came from, who is behind them, how it started, and who they are. Scripture and psychology agree that a person really does not answer the question,\n“Who am I?” until he or she knows who his or her father is.\nToday, human relationships between parents and children increasingly have become broken and fragmented, and the result has been a widespread identity crisis. Christianity’s answer to that identity crisis is to bring men and women into a direct, personal relationship with God the Father through Jesus Christ the Son. People who truly know God as Father no longer have an identity problem. They know who they are—they are children of God. Their Father created the universe, their Father loves them, and their Father cares for them. ',

It means we are much favored. We are the objects of His particular, loving care and attention. We are number one on His list of things to take care of in the universe. He does not push us off in a corner and say, “Wait, I’m busy,” or “I don’t have time for you now,”\nor “Don’t make a noise; Daddy is sleeping.” He says, “I’m interested in you. I want you. You’re welcome. Come in; I’ve been waiting a long time for you.”\nIt is like the father in the story of the prodigal son. He was out there looking for the boy to come home. Others did not have to say,\n“You know, your son is coming home.” The first one to know it was the father. He knew it before all the rest of the family. God’s attitude to us in Christ is like that. We are not rejects. We are not second-class citizens. And we are not servants.\nWhen the prodigal came back, he was willing to be a servant. He said, “Father, just make me one of your hired servants.” But if you read the story carefully, you will notice that when the son confessed his sins, his father interrupted him—he didn’t allow him to finish speaking. He never allowed him to say, “Make me as one of your hired servants.” On the contrary, he said,  “Bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet. And bring the fatted calf here and kill it, and let us eat and be merry; for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found” (Luke 15:22–24). Praise God! ',

We think,  If I build the biggest church or hold the largest meeting or amass the most names on my mailing list, I will be secure.

    "body": 'Often, the measure of God’s commitment to you is determined by the measure of your commitment to Him. God never makes partial commitments, and He does not want any partial commitments.\nGod has established the price of a relationship with Him. It is everything you have. “He…that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple” (Luke 14:33 kjv).\nYou may say, “That sounds hard.” But it is realistic. Let me tell you two facts about God’s kingdom. First of all, God never has a sale. He never reduces the price on any item. If you want the relationship that Peter, Paul, and John had with the Lord, you must pay what they paid.\nGod has not offered a discount.\nThe second fact is good news: in God’s kingdom, there is no inflation. The price has never gone up, and it has never gone down. It is always the same.\nThe outcome of a commitment to God is peace, security, and joy.\nDo you want it? You have to make the decision. Jesus said, Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.\n(Revelation 3:20 kjv)\nNotice the order Jesus established in this verse. First, you give Jesus your supper, and then He gives you His. As Jesus said to His Father,  “All Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine”  (John 17:10).

Enoch just “walked with God”\n(see Genesis 5:22, 24). As we go on further in the Bible, we meet the great father of the faith, Abraham, with his most honorable title, which was “ friend of God”  (James 2:23). He and God simply enjoyed one another’s company.\nI sometimes long to get away from all the theology and all the religious formalities and just have a relationship of being God’s friend—walking with Him and enjoying His company. I really believe God loves to be enjoyed by His people.\nSometimes, we get so preoccupied with methodology and theology and doctrine that we lose sight of God in the midst of it all. We get into the middle of the forest, where all we can see are trees. We no longer can see the whole picture.

    "body": 'God entered into covenant with Abraham, as recorded in Genesis 15. Each person involved—God and Abraham—made a total commitment. There came a time when God called on Abraham to fulfill his commitment and offer his son, Isaac, as a sacrifice. But God’s commitment was just as total as Abraham’s. So, two thousand years later, the other side of the covenant came to the fore: God gave up His only Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.\nRemember that the commitment you make to God usually determines the measure of God’s commitment to you. Total commitment to God calls for total commitment from God. That is the very essence of a covenant relationship. However, Abraham’s covenant with God had a further practical effect on his personal relationship with God. In his epistle, James spoke about what Abraham did when he offered up Isaac, and the result of his willingness to do so.\nWas not Abraham our father justified by works, when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar? You see that faith was working with his works, and as a result of the works, faith was perfected; and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,” and he was called the friend of God.\n(James 2:21–23 nasb)\nThrough that covenant commitment and through its outworking in the offering up of Isaac, Abraham was reckoned as God’s friend. That is a very significant and honorable title. The lesson is this: covenant is the door to true friendship. When two individuals make a covenant with one another and live out the terms of their covenant, that is true friendship at work. ',

He looks for an inner attitude of the heart toward Himself, an attitude of reverent submission and respect.\nFurthermore, God sets the curriculum. He teaches such individuals\n“in the way that he [God] shall choose”  (Psalm 25:12 kjv). Often, the way God chooses is not the way that we would choose for ourselves.\nWe might incline toward themes of prophecy or revelation that seem profound, whereas God’s curriculum might focus on what is humble and down-to-earth: service, sacrifice, and faithfulness.\nFor those who submit to God’s instruction, there is a wonderful reward: “The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him”  (Psalm 25:14\nkjv). In human relationships, we share our secrets only with those whom we trust. Likewise, when God shares His secrets with us, it is proof that we have earned His trust. It is our certificate of graduation from His school.\nThis truth is illustrated beautifully in the relationship of Jesus to His disciples. After He had put them through three years of rigorous discipline, He told them, “I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master’s business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you” (John 15:15 niv). First, Jesus Himself learned from the Father through perfect submission to Him. Then, Jesus, in turn, passed on all He had learned from the Father to those who submitted in like manner to Him.\nGod still chooses His students on this basis. Neither His requirements nor His curriculum have changed. ',

So, in naming the animals, Adam had to understand their natures and their relationships to one another. Whatever Adam called an animal, that was its name. God did not name the animals; He told Adam to do that. But God gave Adam the insight and the wisdom that he needed to complete the assignment. Likewise, in our new relationship with God in Jesus Christ, we are not slaves; rather, we are intelligent partners with God.\nJohn 15:15 is an astonishing statement:\nI no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master’s business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you.\n(niv)\nJesus held nothing back.

The first thing you have to do is to stop trying to make yourself righteous. Stop trying to be a little better. Call a halt to all that. “To him that worketh not.” What should we do? Let’s look again at the end of that passage: “But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness”\n(verse 5 kjv). Just believe. Is it that simple? If it is not that simple, we will never make it. God makes unrighteous people righteous—that is what the Scripture says, and I believe it.\nFor he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.\n(2 Corinthians 5:21 kjv)\nI like to change the order of the words in that verse, substituting specific names for the pronouns. “For God has made Jesus, who knew no sin, to be sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Jesus.” There is the complete exchange.

    "body": 'Righteousness produces certain immediate and definite observable results. The whole of our lives, including our attitudes, our relationships, and the effectiveness of our acts of Christian service, will depend on how far we realise that we have been made righteous.\nWe read in Proverbs 28:1,  “The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion”  (kjv). Few Christians today are bold.\nMost are timid, apologetic; they back down when confronted with evil.\nThe root cause is a failure to realise that they are righteous in God’s sight—as righteous as Jesus Christ Himself. When we acknowledge and appreciate that fact, it makes us bold.\nLet’s look at some other results of righteousness. Isaiah 32:17 says,\n“And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever” (kjv). This passage speaks of three products of righteousness: peace, quietness, and assurance, which come when we realise that we have been made righteous with Jesus Christ’s righteousness. Romans 14:17 tells us, “For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost”\n(kjv). Peace, quietness, joy, and assurance are products of righteousness.\nIf we do not receive righteousness by faith, we may struggle to achieve these results, but in vain. It is pathetic to see Christians trying to be joyful, have peace, relax, and have assurance—just because somebody told them they ought to. My experience is that when Christians really receive the assurance of the forgiveness of sin and of righteousness by faith, the results of righteousness follow automatically. The key is getting people to realise that they have been made righteous with the righteousness of Jesus Christ. ',

The only righteousness that will admit us into heaven is the righteousness of God, which comes only by faith in Jesus Christ. It is received by faith as a gift. Here is the first specific manifestation of God’s grace in the lives of those who come to Him through Jesus Christ: righteousness. God cannot do anything for us until He has made us righteous; it is the first thing He does when we approach Him.\nYou would probably agree that the majority of Christians have never grasped this truth. In fact, I think you will find that much of the church’s liturgy—including our music and our hymns—are designed to leave us sin-conscious. In many cases, we almost feel that it’s presumptuous to consider ourselves anything but sinful. This is a remarkable fact.\nThere is one thing the devil fights against as powerfully as anything else, and that is any person who begins to realise what it is to be made righteous by faith. Satan will keep you, by any means that he can, under some measure of condemnation and guilt, and he’ll keep you feeling very religious about it, too.\nMany people would feel embarrassed or presumptuous to call themselves “righteous,” for they think that they have to earn righteousness. Scripture, however, emphasizes that, rather than being something we can merit, righteousness is a gift no one deserves. It is a free, unmerited gift. You either receive it as a gift, or you live without it. The choice is yours. ',

Jesus said, “I am the vine, you are the branches”  (verse 5). He was very specific. He has given us a point of orientation in interpreting the whole picture. Jesus Himself is the vine.\nFor a vine to live and bear fruit, there must be sap—a source of nutrients that flows up from the roots, through the trunk, and into the branches. If the sap does not reach the branches, however, they will wither and fail to bear fruit. The key to the life of the vine is the sap, which represents the Holy Spirit. In Romans 8:10, Paul said, If Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.\n(kjv)\nWe experienced Christ’s death because of our sins.

And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.\n(Revelation 19:7–8 kjv)\nThere are two Greek words that mean “righteousness.” One is dikaiosune, the other is dikaioma.  Dikaiosune is righteousness as an abstract concept.  Dikaioma is righteousness manifested in act, or an act of righteousness. When you and I believe in Jesus Christ, His righteousness— dikaiosune—is imputed to us. We are made righteous with His righteousness. When we live out our faith, we express that imputed righteousness in dikaioma, which is outworked righteousness, or an act of righteousness.\nIt is interesting to note that the word used here in Revelation is the plural form of  dikaioma, dikaiomata.  The fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints. It is a very searching statement. “His wife hath made herself ready.”  She has done this by her acts of righteousness.\nEvery culture that I have encountered has embraced one common rule regarding marriage ceremonies. The bridegroom never prepares the bride; rather, the bride always prepares herself. The responsibility is placed on her alone. The Scripture says that the wife of Christ, the church, has made herself ready by her outworked righteous acts. The imputed righteousness of Christ will not avail for the bridal feast.

It is not the soul that is united with God, but the spirit—for the spirit was created for union with God; indeed, it cannot live out of union with God. As a result of regeneration, the spirit of the born-again believer is able to unite with God.\nLet us review three simple descriptions of the orientations of spirit, soul, and body. The spirit is God-conscious. The soul is self-conscious.\nThe body is world-conscious.\nThrough our spirits, we are conscious of God. In our souls, we are conscious of ourselves. And through our bodies and their senses, we relate to the world around us.\nWhen man’s spirit is reunited with God, the rekindled spirit becomes a lamp. Filled with the Holy Spirit, it illuminates the inward nature of man which was dark and alienated from God up to that time.\nWe need to remember that when the Bible was written, the fuel for every lamp was olive oil, and olive oil is always a type, or symbol, of the Holy Spirit.\nThe spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord, searching all the innermost parts of his being.\n(Proverbs 20:27 nasb)\nWhen the spirit of man is brought back into union with God and the Holy Spirit comes in and fills up that lamp, then the lamp inside man—his spirit—is illuminated, shedding light on his entire inner being.

For ‘the two,’ He\n[God]  says, ‘shall become one flesh.’”  We all understand what this verse is talking about—sexual immorality, fornication, and being physically united with a prostitute. With that context in mind, look at what Paul said next: “But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with Him”\n(verse 17). This verse cannot be taken out of context. As we have seen, in verse 17, Paul was talking about a union that is just as real as the sexual union—not a physical union, but a spiritual union. That is what it means to be married to the One who is risen from the dead. It is not our souls that are united to the Lord; rather, it is our spirits, for “he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.”\nYour soul is capable of theology, and it is probably overburdened with it, but your spirit knows God. The spirit is the God-inbreathed part of man. That is what brought man into being in the first place in the garden of Eden. The Lord breathed into Adam’s nostrils the spirit of life. (See Genesis 2:7.) And that part of man never finds rest until it is reunited with God. You can chase after all the pleasures and philosophies of the world, but your spirit is not interested in them. Your spirit just wants God, and it is your spirit that can be united with God just as truly as a body of a man can be united with the body of a prostitute.\nNever separate those two verses. They are totally different, but their analogy is exact and helps us to understand their relationship. ',

For instance, God is three in one—Father, Son, and Spirit—three persons in one God. Man is likewise triune; one man is made up of spirit, soul, and body. I believe that heaven is triune, as well. There are three heavens—\nthe visible heaven, which we see; an intermediate heaven, which is the headquarters of Satan’s kingdom; and a third heaven, which is where God dwells; this is the current location of paradise.\nI also believe that the three areas of the tabernacle correspond to the three areas of human personality. The Outer Court, with its natural light of sun, moon, and stars, corresponds to the physical body with the physical senses, which are the source of understanding or perception.\nThe Holy Place corresponds to man’s soul, and it speaks about revealed truth. And the Holy of Holies corresponds to man’s spirit and speaks about directly apprehended truth. This is truth that is apprehended only by direct, personal contact with God, for it is the spirit of man alone that is united with God. “He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit”\n(1 Corinthians 6:17)—not one soul or one body, but one spirit.\nDirect contact with God is spirit to Spirit, and that is where direct revelation comes.

    "body": 'Let’s look at some of the functions of the spirit as it relates to the soul and the body. We have seen that the spirit is God-conscious, the soul is self-conscious, and the body is world-conscious. It is very important to understand that the soul is self-conscious. Whenever people are focused on themselves—their own problems and needs—\nthey are operating in the realm of the soul.\nThe primary activity of the spirit is union with God. It is the only part of man that can be directly united with God. In 1 Corinthians 6:17, Paul said, “He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with Him”— not one soul, not one body, but one spirit. The great privilege we have with our spirits is union and communion with God. The highest activity of man’s spirit is worship.\nMan’s soul contains these three elements: will, intellect, and emotions. The will is the part of me that says, “I want”; the intellect is the part that says, “I think”; and the emotions are the part of me that says, “I feel.” Together, these three components make up the soul.\nThe body is world-conscious; through the senses, the body contacts the surrounding time-space world. God’s original purpose was that man’s spirit should direct his soul, and that his soul should direct his body. The spirit can direct the body only through the soul.\nThere is one exception to this, and that is speaking in tongues. That is why speaking in tongues is such a unique experience. When we speak in tongues, our spirits control the physical member, the tongue, without the soul’s involvement. That is why it is such a tremendously important experience. ',

    "body": 'As we fulfill the Lord’s requirement for our bodies and our souls, our spirits are liberated to enter into a fellowship with God—a fellowship even more wonderful than that which was lost through the fall. Paul said in 1 Corinthians 6:17, “But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with Him.”  The implication is clear. The redeemed spirit can now enjoy a union with God that is close and intimate. It is the spirit alone, however—not the soul or the body—that can experience this direct, intimate union with God.\nIt is primarily through the act of worship that our spirits enter into this union with God. In John 4:23–24, Jesus said,  “The true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth.…God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.”  Jesus made it clear that true worship must be an activity of our spirits.\nIn the contemporary church, there is little understanding of the nature of worship, mainly because we do not discern the difference between the spirit and the soul. Worship is not entertainment—that belongs in the theater, not the church. Nor is worship the same as praise. We praise God with our souls, and it is right to do so. Through our praise we have access to God’s presence. But once we are in His presence, it is through worship that we enjoy true spiritual union with Him. To be able to worship God in this way is the goal of salvation—\nfirst on earth, then later in heaven. It is the highest and holiest activity of which a human being is capable. Worship, however, is possible only when the soul and the body come into submission to the spirit and in harmony with it. Such worship is often too profound for words. It becomes an intense and silent union with God. ',

    "body": 'Worship is the act by which we are joined to the Lord as one spirit.\nThat is why worship is the highest activity of human beings.\nAgain, when we are joined to the Lord in worship, we begin to bring forth (or birth) the things that God wants brought forth.\nWorship is not an appendix to the Christian life; it is not a little addition to services. It is the culmination. It is the confirmation. Once more, if I may put it in this way without offending anyone, it is the consummation of our marriage to the Lord. We are united with Him as one spirit, and when we have that marriage union, it is always for the sake of procreation. That is when spiritual fruit comes out of our lives.\nYou need to know the identity of the husband with whom you are united. Paul wrote in Galatians 5:19–21, “Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these” (nasb).\nThe deeds of the flesh are all too evident. You can tell people that you are spiritual, but if you are truly fleshly, it will show. Let me ask you this: Do you want your children to act like what is described in the passage from Galatians? Because that is what the flesh brings forth. You cannot find one good thing in that entire list. The flesh cannot produce anything acceptable to God. It is corrupt. Jesus said that a corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit. (See Matthew 7:18.) It is impossible. ',

He is no longer in darkness. Furthermore, the reborn spirit becomes a channel through which the Holy Spirit can flow out into this world. Jesus said,\n“He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, ‘From his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.’” But this He spoke of the Spirit [the Holy Spirit] , whom those who believed in Him were to receive; for the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.\n(John 7:38–39 nasb)\nAfter the Holy Spirit was given on the day of Pentecost, the regenerated spirit of man became a channel or riverbed through which rivers of spiritual life could flow out into this world. That is a marvelous transformation, because just before saying the above, Jesus said, “If any man is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink” (verse 37). So, this transformation of regeneration and the infilling of the Holy Spirit produces a marvelous change—a man who was thirsty, who did not even have enough for himself, now becomes a channel through which waters of spiritual life can flow out to the needy world around him.

    "body": 'The Bible teaches that the physical body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, and that when Jesus died on the cross and shed His blood, He redeemed our bodies in addition to our spirits and souls. We belong to Him entirely—spirit, soul, and body.\nGod has a sincere interest in, and a specific purpose for, our bodies.\nThe body is to be the temple of the Holy Spirit. (See 1 Corinthians 6:19.) It is to be the place in man where the Holy Spirit dwells. The Bible tells us that God does not dwell in temples made by hands. (See Acts 7:48.) We can build Him as many churches, synagogues, or tabernacles as we like, but God will not dwell there. God has chosen to dwell in the physical bodies of those who believe in Him. Thus, the believer’s body has an important function as a residence of the Holy Spirit.\nFurthermore, Paul explained this about our physical members:\n“Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God”  (Romans 6:13 kjv). The various members of the physical body are intended to be instruments (or weapons) that God can use. They do not belong to us; they belong to God. We are to yield them to God.\nIt is logical and obvious that God wants His “weapons” in good condition, not feeble or broken-down. He wants our bodies to be healthy and our members to be strong, effective, and active, because they are the members of Christ. In a certain sense, Christ has no body on the earth except ours. Our bodies are the instruments God uses to enact His will on the earth. I have become convinced that God expects us to keep our bodies as strong and as healthy as we can. ',

Jesus is the merchant—not a tourist or a sightseer, but a man who has dealt in pearls all His life—and He knows the exact value of every pearl. The pearl that He has purchased is just one human soul—yours or mine. It cost Him all He had, everything He owned.\nUpdated to our contemporary culture, I can picture the scene when that merchant broke the news to his wife.\n“Honey, I’ve sold our car.”\n“You sold our car!

In Acts 20:28, Paul addressed the elders of the church at Ephesus, saying, “Therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood.”\nNotice that Paul gave to Jesus the specific title of “God.” He said,\n“God…purchased [the church]  with His own blood.”  The purchase price was the blood of Jesus. Then, in 1 Peter 1:17, we read, “And if you call on the Father, who without partiality judges according to each one’s work, conduct yourselves throughout the time of your stay here in fear.”  He was not talking about a slavish fear, but rather about a deep sense of responsibility that comes due to the price that Jesus paid to redeem us. We must never treat ourselves as cheap. When we realise we have been redeemed by the blood of Jesus, we cannot afford to make ourselves cheap.\nYou were not redeemed with corruptible [perishable]  things, like silver or gold, from your aimless conduct received by tradition from your fathers, but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.\n(verses 18–19)\nThe price Jesus paid to redeem us was His precious blood. He is called the Lamb of God, without blemish and without spot. A blemish is something a creature is born with. A spot is something that would mar or stain it afterward. Jesus is without blemish, meaning He is without original sin, and He is without spot, meaning He is without personal sin. It is His perfect blood that has redeemed us. ',

One reason for the redemption of the body was so that it might become the temple of the Lord. The Lord is not going to dwell in a temple that has not been redeemed, one that still belongs to Satan. He will not dwell there. Our bodies have been redeemed so that God may dwell in them by His Holy Spirit. They were redeemed by the blood of Jesus.\nWhat is the response that God requires from us? This is where it becomes extremely practical and is very important for all of us to understand. Paul said,\nI beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.\n(Romans 12:1)\nGiven all that God has done for us through Jesus’ death on the cross, how are we expected to respond? We are to present our bodies as living sacrifices. Why “living sacrifices”? Paul was contrasting living sacrifices with the sacrifices of the Old Testament, which involved the bodies of animals being killed and then placed on God’s altar as an offering to wipe away sin and guilt. Paul was saying, “Place your body on God’s altar, but don’t kill it. Place it on the altar as a living sacrifice.”\nOnce you have placed your body on God’s altar, it no longer belongs to you. It belongs to God.

Again, sanctify is a religious word, and many people are confused about its meaning.\nThe word sanctify is related to the word saint and is directly related in the original biblical languages to the word for “holy.” So, to sanctify means “to make saintly,” or “to make holy.” Holiness includes the aspect of being set apart to God. The one who is sanctified finds himself in an area where God has access to him but the devil does not. To be sanctified is to be removed from the area of Satan’s reach and placed in an area where we are available to God. That is what it is to be sanctified: set apart to God, made holy. Just like righteousness, sanctification does not come by works, by effort, or by religion. It comes only by faith in the blood of Jesus. You belong to God, you are under God’s control, and you are available to God. Anything that is not of God has no right of approach to you; it is kept away by the blood.\nIn Colossians 1:12–13, Paul wrote,  “Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light. For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves” (niv). Through faith in the blood of Jesus, we have been removed from the area of Satan’s authority and translated into the kingdom of God. We have been totally translated. We are not going to be  translated; we have  already been translated—spirit, soul, and body. We are not in the devil’s territory.\nWe are not under the devil’s laws.

I have counseled many people whom I simply had to tell,\n“One of your problems is that you are not in your right geographical place. This is not the place where you ought to be. You will never really flourish until you find your place.”\nHowever, “your place” is not primarily a geographical location; rather, it is a place in God, a place in the body of Christ. Scripture says that every one of us should be a member of the body. As a member, each one of us has to fit into the right place for that member. A hand looks ridiculous at the end of a leg. A foot looks ridiculous at the end of an arm. You have to find out what kind of a member you are so that you will fit into the place that is appropriate for you.\nGod…has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began.\n(2 Timothy 1:8–9)\nThat is a tremendous passage, almost unsearchable in its depth.\nIt says that God “has saved us,”  but it does not stop there.

He said, “The church…is His [Christ’s] body.”  Paul developed this theme in 1 Corinthians, saying, “Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually”  (1 Corinthians 12:27). He used various examples from the physical body to emphasize the fact that, as Christians, we are all interdependent; we all need one another.\nThe most complete and authoritative picture of the church as the body of Christ is given in Ephesians. It is most significant, therefore, that throughout this epistle, Paul spoke consistently of Christians in the plural. He had virtually nothing to say to or about individual Christians. (See Ephesians 1:3–12.) A careful reading of the rest of Ephesians will confirm that this is the book’s message from beginning to end. There are no promises and no prayers for any individual. Only in the last six verses is there one brief exception: Paul closed by asking for special prayer for himself.\nThis focus on the collective body of Christ comes to its climax in Ephesians 6:10–18, where Paul spoke about our spiritual warfare. In verse 12, all the key words are in the plural—both those that refer to God’s people and those that refer to the opposing forces: we wrestle against principalities, powers, rulers, and hosts.\nDepicted thusly, spiritual warfare is not a conflict between individuals, but a vast war between opposing armies. There is no room here for “lone rangers” pursuing their individual goals. Victory will require controlled and concerted action by God’s people, working together as members of one body. This will demand discipline and a readiness to submit to scriptural authority. ',

The reason is not that you do not have enough faith, but that you are trying to use your faith for something for which it was not meant to be used. It was given for the specific job and place you have in the body of believers.\nMy hand does a wonderful job as a hand. It opens my Bible, turning the pages. It does most everything I ask of it. But if should I try to do those jobs with my foot, I would be in trouble.\nIf you are always struggling for faith, you are probably trying to do the wrong job. You are a hand trying to be a foot, or a foot trying to be a hand. This is God’s way of guiding you into your place. ',

The eye cannot say to the hand, “I don’t need you.” The head cannot say to the foot, “I don’t need you.” Even the weakest members can be the ones that are actually the most important.\nNo member of the human body is more vulnerable or sensitive than the eye. Yet few, if any, are more valuable. Notice how carefully nature has protected the eye all around. The primary function of several other areas of the face is to protect the eye. But the eye gets all that protection and honor not because it is strong, but because it is weak. This is the way the body has been knit together. The strong must protect the weak.\nWe cannot ignore or despise any member of the body of Christ, big or small, strong or weak.\nThis principle is true of the members of Christ’s body. We need one another; we depend on one another. We must honor one another.\nWhen one member suffers, the others suffer with it. When one member is honored, the others are honored with it. (See 1 Corinthians 12:26.) That is the nature of the universal body of Jesus Christ, the church. ',

We come to realise that each of us is just one member, incomplete on our own, incapable of functioning on our own as God intends us to function. In order to be complete and to function in accordance with God’s purpose and plan, each of us has to become a member in the body. We have to be joined to other members by a kind of commitment that enables us to work together, and not just as isolated individuals.\nWhen traveling on airplanes, I have often marveled as the plane’s navigation system zeroed in on the particular airport and the two locked on to one another. The plane came down in exactly the right place at exactly the right speed to make a safe and smooth landing. I suggest thinking of your renewed mind like the navigation system of an airplane.

It grieves the Lord bitterly if we have a wrong attitude toward a member of His body, if we look down on others and discount their value.\nI believe that was the problem of the people of Corinth, whom Paul addressed in two epistles. There were many wrong relationships between them. They did not discern the Lord’s body in one another (see 1 Corinthians 11:29), and Paul said, “For this reason many are weak and sick among you, and many sleep [have died]” (verse 30).

And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I am not a part of the body,” it is not for this reason any the less a part of the body.\nIf the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be? But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, just as He desired.\n(1 Corinthians 12:12, 14–18 nasb)\nThere are three things we need to see in this statement of Paul. First, the choice of where and what we are to be in the body is not ours, but God’s. God has arranged the members of His body and assigned their functions. It is not for us to decide; rather, God decides and reveals His decisions to us.\nSecond, as this comes to pass in our lives, we merge our lives in a larger entity, the body—yet we still retain our individuality. It is like a little finger that finds its place on a hand, side-by-side with four other fingers, and is thus connected to the total life and purpose of a complete body. As Christians, we never lose our individual identities, but we do become a part of a larger, corporate group, all the while being the particular members that God ordained us to be.\nThird, as a corporate body, we are able to represent Christ in His fullness to the world. None of us can adequately represent Christ on our own; but when we are united to a body, that body can totally, corporately, and fully represent Jesus Christ to our world.\nThank You, Jesus, for making me a part of Your body.

    "body": 'There is tremendous misunderstanding about holiness. Many Christians try to achieve holiness by abstaining from things. They think, If I do not do this or that, then I am holy.  But that has nothing to do with being holy. There are things you cannot do if you are holy, but to suggest that holiness means cutting down on the number of things you are involved in is not correct. Holiness is not negative. Paul wrote in Colossians 2:20, “Therefore, if you died with Christ from the basic principles of the world, why, as though living in the world, do you subject yourselves to regulations…?”  This is most people’s view of holiness—\nsubjecting oneself to regulations. Paul went on to provide a list of regulations some people follow in an attempt to achieve holiness:\n“Do not touch, do not taste, do not handle,” which all concern things which perish with the using; according to the commandments and doctrines of men….These things indeed have an appearance of wisdom in self-imposed religion, false humility, and neglect of the body, but are of no value against the indulgence of the flesh.\n(verses 21–23)\nIn other words, abstaining from certain things does not make you holy; it is not God’s holiness. In Matthew 5:16, Jesus explained the relationship between holiness and our actions: “Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.”  Letting “your light…shine”  means doing good works so that other people are able to see God. It does not mean observing a set of negative rules. It is a positive, powerful force. In fact, I believe that holiness is the most powerful force at work in our universe. To retreat into a negative lifestyle and call it “holiness” is self-deception. It is not what God means by holiness at all. ',

The word  “saints”  simply means “holy.”\nThe words “to be”  were actually added by the translators. In Greek, this literally says, “called holy ones.”\nRemember that holiness is not some kind of extra qualification that a few believers may acquire; rather, it is something that is expected of all believers. Paul did not conceive of some special “super class” of believers who go on to a higher plane inaccessible to the rest of us. Paul assumed that all believers were going to be holy.\nWhen you accept the gospel invitation of faith in Jesus Christ, God calls you a holy one. You are one who is set apart, ready to yield to the Holy Spirit and to righteousness. You may look at yourself and say,\n“Well, I really don’t seem to be very holy,” but recall what Paul said: that God  “calls those things which do not exist as though they did” (Romans 4:17). God called Abraham “a father of many nations” before he had even one son. (See Genesis 17:4–5.)\nWhen God calls you something, it is because He is going to make you something.

For they indeed for a few days chastened us as seemed best to them, but He [God]  for our profit, that we may be partakers of His holiness.\n(Hebrews 12:9–10)\nIt is God’s desire that we might partake of His holiness. The author of Hebrews continued, “Pursue peace with all people, and holiness, without which no one will see the Lord” (verse 14). First, we are to pursue holiness. Second, in order to achieve holiness, I believe we must pursue peace with all people. We are to attempt to live peaceably, avoiding quarrels or disagreements, if we are able. The writer of Hebrews also issued a solemn warning. He said that we will not see the Lord unless we become partakers of His holiness.\nAnother Scripture passage that expresses God’s desire for holiness in His people says, “For this is the will of God, your sanctification”\n(1 Thessalonians 4:3). What exactly is “sanctification” ? To an extent, the English language obscures the words’ true meaning. An English word ending in the suffix “-ify” means to make something correspond to the quality indicated by whatever precedes the “-ify.” For example, purify means “to make pure”; clarify means “to make clear”; rectify means “to make right.” By extension, sanctify means “to make sanct.” But what is sanct? By derivation, it is the same as saint; and  saint, in turn, is the same as holy. All three words— sanctify, saint, and holy—are derived from one basic Greek word, hagios, the root word for “holy.” Very simply, then, sanctification is the process of making something—or someone—holy.\nThus, we can accurately translate 1 Thessalonians 4:3 in this way:\n“For this is the will of God, that you be made holy.” ',

    "body": 'In the process of sanctification, as in every redemptive process, the initiative is with God, not with man. It begins with God’s choice of us, made in eternity. Thereafter, the sequence of events in time is as follows: (1) the Holy Spirit begins to influence us; (2) He draws us aside from the broad way to destruction (see Matthew 7:13) that we would have followed (see Matthew 7:13); (3) He brings us face-to-face with the truth, which is Jesus Himself (see John 14:6); (4) He imparts to us faith to believe the truth; and (5) through believing the truth, we enter into salvation.\nIn Ephesians 2:8, Paul wrote that we are saved by faith. He then reminded us that this faith does not come from ourselves; rather, it is a gift from the Holy Spirit. In this sense, we could define sanctify as “to set apart to God.” In many cases, the process of sanctification begins long before we come to know God personally. Both the apostle Paul and the prophet Jeremiah were sanctified in their mothers’ wombs. (See Galatians 1:15; Jeremiah 1:5.) God begins to set us apart to Himself long before we have any knowledge of it.\n[We are] elect [chosen]  according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.\n(1 Peter 1:2)\nGod’s choice, made in eternity, is based on His foreknowledge—it is never arbitrary, never random. The Holy Spirit draws us aside to a place of confrontation with the claims of Christ, then gives us grace to obey the gospel. When we obey, the blood of Jesus is sprinkled upon us.\nIn this passage from 1 Peter, we see that the initiative in the process of sanctification is with God, not man, and that the first agent acting in the process is the Holy Spirit.

First John 5:6\nsays that Jesus came  “by water and blood”  (1 John 5:6). The blood is the redeeming blood of Christ, shed on the cross, and the water is the pure water of the Word. Christ redeems us by His blood, then sanctifies and cleanses us by the washing of water by the Word. (See Ephesians 5:25–26.)\nPraying to the Father for His disciples, Jesus said, “Sanctify them by Your truth. Your word is truth”  (John 17:17). One primary way in which the Word of God sanctifies us is by changing how we think.\nSanctification proceeds from the inside out, not from the outside in.\nAgain, the “religious” way to sanctification is to lengthen the dress, cut the hair, wipe off the lipstick, and so forth. Yet in Romans 12:2, Paul said, “Be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.” In Ephesians 4:23, he said, “Be renewed in the spirit of your mind.”  The Holy Spirit renews our minds through the truth—God’s Word.\nIn English, we have the term brainwash, which usually has a negative connotation. The word would be appropriate, however, to describe in a positive light the way in which the Holy Spirit renews our minds, washing them clean with the pure water of God’s Word. This must happen by our faith, an indispensable element in our sanctification.\nGod’s Spirit and God’s Word never vary; our faith enables us to receive what God offers through these agents. Furthermore, there is a direct connection between the Word of God and our faith, for “ faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God”  (Romans 10:17). The more we give heed to God’s Word, the more our faith expands, enabling us to appropriate the total provision God has made for our holiness. ',

It is possible to live in a place where sin and Satan cannot touch us, a place where we are protected and sanctified by the blood of Jesus.\nIn 1 John 1:7, we read, “But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin.”  The present tense in this passage indicates a continual action. If we walk continually in the light, we have continual fellowship, and the blood of Jesus keeps us continually clean. We are kept pure and undefiled; we do not live in the vile contamination of this evil world. We are separated unto God, sanctified, and set apart by the blood of Jesus.\nThe practical key is the place of sanctification—the altar. In the Old Testament, until the sacrifice was placed on the altar, it was just the dead body of a beast. But when the sacrifice was placed on the altar and bound to it, the sacrifice became holy, set apart to God. This is just as true for the New Testament believer. Paul said, “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service”\n(Romans 12:1). The only difference between sacrifices in the Old and New Testaments is that our bodies remain alive—living sacrifices—\nwhen we place them on the altar. The principle of sanctification remains the same. It is the altar that sanctifies the gift placed upon it. The inward change in our thoughts and motives cannot be achieved until we have renounced all rights over our own bodies and placed them, without reservation, upon God’s altar, to be used as God desires.

The ultimate purpose of both is obedience to God, but this obedience is accomplished in different ways. To illustrate this point, let’s look at a simple commandment given in both the Old Testament, under the law of Moses, and the New Testament, in one of the epistles. The exact words are used, and they apply whether we are under the law or under grace.\nIn the Old Testament, God was speaking through Moses to Israel, and He said, “For I am the Lord who brings you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God. You shall therefore be holy, for I am holy”\n(Leviticus 11:45). In context, “being holy” means that you have to keep a set of extremely complicated rules, which are delineated in great detail throughout the remainder of the book of Leviticus. In this case, holiness is attained by the methods of legalism: “Do this. Don’t do that.”\nThe New Testament passage is addressed to Christians who have accepted Jesus’ redemption on their behalf: “As obedient children, not conforming yourselves to the former lusts, as in your ignorance; but as He who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, because it is written, ‘Be holy, for I am holy’” (1 Peter 1:14–16). The quotation is taken from Leviticus, so does that mean Peter was telling us that we must observe all the Old Testament rules about animal sacrifices and mildews and bodily fluids? Obviously not. So, he must expect something different. The holiness of the law says, “I have to keep all these rules.” The alternative response of faith is, “I don’t follow a set of rules. I let Jesus be holy, in me and through me.” ',

(Ephesians 1:3–6 niv) Paul here explained what was God’s eternal purpose even before creation: that we might become His children—His sons and His daughters. The only way that this could be achieved was through the substitutionary death of Jesus on the cross. When Jesus bore our sin and suffered our rejection, He opened the way for our acceptance. For that period alone, He lost His status as God’s Son so that we might gain that same status—as God’s sons and daughters.\nI love the sixth verse, “To the praise of his glorious grace, which he has freely given us in the One he loves.”  The word that is translated\n“ freely given us”  is a very powerful word. It is the same word used by the angel in saluting the Virgin Mary,  “You who are highly favored”\n(Luke 1:28 niv). It means that we have become the objects of God’s special favor.

In love….” Whichever period placement you use, the fact remains that God’s love precedes time. Before the creation of the world, God loved us, chose us, and predestined us. He arranged the course of His life so that we would encounter Him and experience His love.\nThere is a very simple statement in the Song of Solomon that says,\n“Love is as strong as death” (8:6). Death is inevitable. When death comes, nobody can turn it away. Nobody can say, “I’m not ready. I won’t accept you.” No man has the power to resist death.\nBut the New Testament takes us one step further. When Jesus died and rose again from the dead, He proved that love is stronger than death.\nThe most irresistible, negative force in the universe was conquered by the most irresistible, positive force in the universe—the love of God.\nLove always achieves its objectives; it is invincible. It accepts no barriers.\nIt will get past every obstacle in order to get to where it wants to go.\nGod’s love is individual and everlasting. It precedes time; it is irresistible.

But the final thrust of Satan’s tactics is to tempt us to direct disobedience.\nJesus used only one weapon to defeat Satan: the  rhema, or the spoken Word of God. He countered each temptation with the same phrase: “It is written.” (See, for example, Matthew 4:4, 7, 10.) Each was a direct quotation from the Old Testament. Satan has no defense against the Word of God thus quoted directly at him. He has no choice but to withdraw in defeat.\nIn all of this, Jesus is our perfect example. He did not rely on any wisdom or arguments of His own; rather, He used precisely the same weapon God has given to us: the Word of God. Our security depends on following the example of Jesus. Satan is a thousand times wiser and stronger than we are. He can point to a thousand flaws in our own righteousness. But there is one weapon against which he has no defense: the Word of God, spoken in faith.\nSuch, then, is the path that leads us out of the territory overshadowed by curses and into the territory that enjoys the sunlight of God’s blessings.\nIts first requirement is unswerving faith, based on the exchange that took place on the cross. Faith of this kind reckons God’s promises as effective from the moment they are apprehended. By prompt, unquestioning obedience and patient endurance, we move from our legal rights in Christ into the full, experiential enjoyment of them. We meet all satanic opposition with “the sword of the Spirit”: the spoken Word of God. (See Ephesians 6:17.) ',

Now if we are children, then we are heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory.\n(niv)\nThe word  Abba is the Aramaic or Hebrew equivalent of the English word “Daddy.” Thus, we see here a relationship of intimacy with God the Father, whom we address as Daddy. The Spirit of God Himself gives us the assurance and confidence to do so.\nThe Bible tells us that we are God’s children, but the Spirit of God reinforces that truth personally to each of us, in our hearts. We are God’s children. And when we become children, we become heirs. We are made heirs of God and coheirs with Christ. Of course, one condition is stated: if we are willing to share His sufferings. If we share in the inheritance, we also share in the sufferings. Remember, the pearl is a product of pressure and stress.\nIt is important to understand what it means to be coheirs. It does not mean that we each get a little fraction of the total inheritance.\nRather, it means that Jesus, as the first Son of God, has the whole inheritance, and we share the whole inheritance with Him. Each one of us has a right to the entire inheritance, which is the inheritance of Jesus. The law of God’s kingdom is sharing. We do not each grab our own portions, but we all share together everything that God the Father has and everything that Christ the Son has. ',

You are accepted; you are highly favored; you are the object of His special care and affection. Everything He does revolves around you.\nPaul said to the Corinthians, who were not exactly top-notch Christians, “All this is for your benefit” (2 Corinthians 4:15 niv).\nEverything God does, He does for us. You do not get conceited when you realise this fact. Instead, you become humble. There is no room left for arrogance when you see the grace of God. It is significant that, before His crucifixion, Jesus’ last prayer with His disciples was for those who were His followers, as well as for those who would follow afterward.\n(See John 17:20.) That prayer concerned our relationship with God as our Father, and it concluded, “Righteous Father, though the world does not know you, I know you, and they know that you have sent me. I have made you known to them” (John 17:25–26 niv).\nJesus make God known to us as Father. The Jews had known God as Yahweh for fourteen centuries, but the only Person who could introduce Him as Father was His Son. Six times in this prayer for His disciples, Jesus addressed God as Father (see verses 1, 5, 11, 21, 24, 25).\nWhen Jesus prayed, “And [I] will continue to make you known”\n(verse 26), He was saying that He would continue to reveal God as Father. Then, we come to the purpose of this revelation: “In order that the love you have for me may be in them and that I myself may be in them” (John 17:26 niv). God has exactly the same love for us as He has for Jesus. We are as dear to God as Jesus Himself is. However, there is another aspect to this. Because Jesus is in us, we can love God in the same way that Jesus loves Him. ',

Apart from the Holy Spirit, we cannot grow up, we cannot mature. As Paul said in Romans 8:14, “For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God” (nasb).\nThe word for  “sons,”  in this verse, is not the same as the word for\n“children”  in the other passages. This means a mature son—one who is responsible, who is in control of his life, who knows how to act, and who has authority.\nHow do we come to that place of maturity? Paul said, “All who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.”  That is the second great ministry of the Spirit in our lives as members of God’s family: to mature us. But this comes by one process alone: being led by the Spirit of God. There is no other way to reach maturity. And “being led” is a continual action. We have to be led continually—every day, every hour, in every situation—by the Spirit of God. That is the only way that we can live as mature sons of God.\nThe tragedy in the church today is that countless numbers of people who have been born again of the Spirit of God have never learned to be led by the Spirit of God. Consequently, they never achieve maturity.\nThey always remain, in some sense, spiritually childish. This result is not because the provision for the maturation process is not there, but it is because they have not understood how to avail themselves of that provision. The provision is to be led by the Holy Spirit. ',

The world has not known You, but I have known You; and these [disciples]  have known that You sent Me.\nAnd I have declared to them Your name.\n(John 17:25–26)\nThe name Jesus came to reveal was Father. You find very few uses of the word Father as a title of God in the Old Testament. The only person who could fully reveal the Father was the Son. Then, Jesus said, I have declared to them Your name, and will declare it, that the love with which You loved Me may be in them, and I in them.\n(verse 26)\nThe ultimate purpose of the gospel is this love relationship with God by which God loves us in exactly the same way that He loved—\nand still loves—Jesus, and that we love God in exactly the same way that Jesus loves Him. That is the purpose—to bring us into the family of God, to bring us into a relationship with God as Father that is the same relationship that Jesus has.

The most common title used is brothers, emphasizing membership in one spiritual family. As Paul wrote in Ephesians 2:18, “For through Him [Jesus Christ]  we both [Jews and Gentiles] have access by one Spirit to the Father.”  Notice that all three persons of the Godhead are represented here. Through Jesus the Son, we have access to the Father by one Spirit.\nThe next verse reveals the wondrous result: “Now, therefore [because we have access to the Father],  you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God” (verse 19). The word “household”  would be best represented in contemporary English by the word  family.  Because Christ has gained us access to the Father, we have become members of God’s family.\nThe composition of God’s family is determined by its members’\nrelationships with the Father. In New Testament Greek, there is a very close similarity between the words father and family. The word for\n“father” is pater; the word for “family” is  patria, which is derived from pater. This relationship is brought out clearly in Paul’s prayer: For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, from whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named.\n(Ephesians 3:14–15)\nThere is a direct play here on the words “Father”  and “ family.”\nFrom God the Father ( pater), the whole family ( patria) in heaven and earth is named.

However, we rarely stop to consider its full implication. A way  is meaningless unless it takes us somewhere. A way is not an end in itself. So, when Jesus said, “I am the way,”  He was implying that He had come to take us somewhere.\nWhere is He taking us? He explained, “No one comes to the Father except through Me” (verse 6). In other words, He was saying, “I am the way to the Father. I am the revelation of the Father. If you have seen Me, you have seen the Father.” (See verses 7–9.)\nAnd He [Jesus]  came and preached peace to you who were afar off [the Gentiles] and to those who were near [the Jews] .

The verse is meaningless if you leave out the Father.\nThe ultimate objective is to reveal the Father and to bring us to Him.\nIf we stop short of the fulfillment of that objective, we have missed the purpose for which Jesus came.\nFor Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for the unjust, in order that He might bring us to God.\n(1 Peter 3:18 nasb)\nWhy did Jesus die?

They say,\n“If we aren’t dancing on the platform by 6:45 p.m. on Sunday evening, we are not having liberty.” Or, “If we don’t all clap our hands, we don’t have liberty.” Some preachers think that if they don’t stomp on the platform and shout, they don’t have liberty.\nLiberty is not following a certain program in church. It is not going through certain motions, such as lifting up your hands. That can be liberty, but it can just as easily be bondage.

These people say, “If that is the objective, I give up now, because it is unattainable.”\nBut the word perfect is found in Scripture, and we cannot get away from it. Sooner or later, we have to face it.\nPerfect has three main meanings in Scripture. The first is “mature,”\nor “fully grown up.” We all see that as a reasonable objective—one that gives us nothing to fear. Another related meaning is “complete,” having nothing deficient or defective. Keep in mind that these two meanings do not necessarily go together. A person may be fully grown up and still have defects in some areas of his body. He may even be missing part of his body, such as a limb, a digit, or an organ. In this case, he is mature yet incomplete. Another person might have all of his members intact and functioning, but he might not be fully grown up or mature.\nWe have to combine the ideas of maturity and completeness in this picture of perfection.\nIn Ephesians 4, in the phrase “the perfecting of the saints” (verse 12 kjv), the Greek verb for perfect means “to articulate,” or “to fit together.” A related word is used in Hebrews 11:3, where it says that by the Word of God, “the worlds were framed,”  or “fitted together.” So, the word perfect  also has to do with putting something together in such a way that every part works harmoniously with the others and fulfills its proper function. We have three distinct ideas—maturity, completeness, and proper integration—fit together in such a way that the whole functions harmoniously. That is the objective that Scripture sets before us as believers. ',

He cannot omit any part of God’s total provision and expect that some other part will serve as a substitute for that which has been omitted.\nYet, it is at this point precisely that so many Christians go astray in their thinking. Consciously or unconsciously, they reason that because they know they have availed themselves of some part, or parts, of God’s provision for them, they do not need to concern themselves about other parts that they have omitted.\nFor instance, some Christians put a significant emphasis upon witnessing by word of mouth but are negligent about the practical aspects of daily Christian living. Conversely, other Christians are careful about their conduct but fail to witness openly to their friends and neighbors. Each of these types of Christians tends to criticize or despise the other, yet both are equally at fault. Good Christian living is no substitute for witnessing by word of mouth. On the other hand, witnessing by word of mouth is no substitute for good Christian living.\nGod requires both. The believer who omits one or the other does not stand perfect and complete in the will of God. ',

I looked in Christianity, as it was then presented to me, and concluded that Christianity did not have the answer. I was perfectly right—it didn’t. I turned to Greek philosophy, I turned to Yoga, I turned to all sorts of ridiculous things. Then, in 1941, in an army barrack room one evening around midnight, when no one else was awake, I had a personal encounter with the Lord Jesus Christ. And in that encounter, I discovered that I had met the answer.\nSometime later, I read something Paul wrote concerning Jesus Christ: “In [Him]  are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge”\n(Colossians 2:3 kjv). I said to myself, Why should I grub around any longer in the rubbish bins of human wisdom when all the treasures are hidden in Jesus Christ?  And I made a decision that the Bible is the book with the answers, and I resolved to find in it what God has hidden in Jesus Christ.\nSometimes I have strayed; sometimes I have become deflected and diverted. But Jesus is “the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last” (Revelation 22:13) and  “the author and finisher of our faith”  (Hebrews 12:2). We are complete in Him. If you ever start to look outside Christ, you will find all sorts of interesting theories and stimulating presentations, but you will be feeding on the husks when you could be living on the Father’s bread.

For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form, and you have been given fullness in Christ.\n(Colossians 2:8–10 niv)\nThat is my aim—to enter into the fullness that has been given to us in Jesus Christ, who is to be our ultimate goal and satisfaction. We can illustrate this with a parallel to the tabernacle of Moses, as described in the Old Testament. Its structure was in three sections: first, the Outer Court; then, inside the first curtain, the Holy Place; and inside the second curtain, the Holy of Holies. Again, one simple way to distinguish between these is by the light available in each section.\nIn the Outer Court, the light is natural, provided by the sun, moon, and stars. In the Holy Place, there is no natural light. The light is provided by the seven-branched candlestick, where oil is ignited in the bowls to provide light. Once inside the Holy Place, you are no longer living by your senses, but by faith. Remarkably, beyond the second curtain, there was no light at all. There was only one reason to enter: to meet with God. When a man with a true heart went in beyond that second veil, it became gloriously illuminated with the supernatural presence of God, called the shekinah. That is the ultimate goal. There is nothing to entice us beyond that second veil except God. He provides no alternative attractions—it is God or nothing. If God does not come, you are left in total darkness. Living with God as our goal means pursuing no alternative attractions. It is God Himself, God alone. The light that I seek is neither natural nor artificial; it is supernatural—the presence of God Himself. ',

The first one is called the perfect tense: “ for by one offering [sacrifice] He has perfected forever….”  You can say the sacrifice is perfectly perfect. It is completely complete. Just before this phrase, the writer of Hebrews said that the Old Testament priests always stood, offering again and again the same sacrifices that could never take away sin. Then, the writer said about Jesus, “But this Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God” (Hebrews 10:12). Notice the contrast between the Old Testament priests, who stood, and Jesus, who offered His sacrifice and sat down. Why did Jesus sit down? Because He had nothing left to do. He had done it all. Whereas the job of the Old Testament priests was never finished because their sacrifices were not adequate to deal with the real problem, Jesus’ death on the cross was a complete and final act.\nAs far as what Jesus has done, it is complete and perfect. Nothing must be added to it, and nothing can ever be taken away from it. Jesus’\nsacrifice is valid forever. That is the perfect tense.\nThen, speaking about those of us who are appropriating Jesus’\nsacrifice, the author of Hebrews wrote,  “He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified” (Hebrews 10:14). “Are being sanctified”  is in the present progressive tense. What Jesus has done is perfect, and our appropriation of it is continual, ongoing. As we are sanctified, as we are set apart to God more and more, and as we draw closer to God and appropriate more of God’s provision and promises, we are entering more and more into the provision of the sacrifice.

To make this word less frightening, I would like to use a simple example from mathematics.\nLet’s take the use of the word round. There is only one standard for round. Something is either round or not round. If something is round, it is a circle. There is just one kind of circle; there are not three or four different kinds of circles. However, there are many different sizes of circles. When two things have identical shapes but different sizes, they are called “similar.”\nGod the Father is the great circle, the measureless round ring that encompasses the whole universe. Jesus does not expect us to have the same magnitude as God, but He does expect us to have the same character as God. We are to be similar to, not the same as, God. You and I may be very tiny circles—operating in some small areas where God has placed us with apparently trivial, humdrum duties. But, for each of us in our own little area, God wants us to be a perfect circle.\nPerfectly round. Just as round as that “great circle,” God the Father, who encompasses the whole universe.\nSo, when you read Jesus’ command to “be perfect” (Matthew 5:48), think of it in terms of being “round.” Don’t be lopsided, having little bulges. Don’t have deficiencies. You may not be very big, but you can be a perfect circle. ',

The old man died in Christ on the cross, so that, by exchange, the new man might live in us now. This is a theme that runs through the New Testament, but it is dealt with very infrequently in many sections of the church today. The contrast between the old man, who died on the cross, and the new man, who has been resurrected with Christ, is brought forth through the resurrection of Jesus.\nChrist’s crucifixion is a historical event that actually took place at a specific moment in time. I think it tremendously strengthens our faith when we view it in this way. It is something that actually did happen.\nIt is true, whether we believe it or not; it is true, whether we know it or not. But when we know it and believe it, it has a tremendous effect on our lives. In Romans 6:6, Paul stated that “our old man was crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin.”  The King James Version says “that the body of sin might be destroyed,”  but I prefer to say “rendered ineffective; put out of action.”\nThe slavery of having sin as our master is terminated in our lives when we realise that the old man died and that a new man now lives in us. But if we do not realise this, believe it, and act upon it, there is no full escape from the slavery of sin. This is the only way out of the bondage or slavery of sin. ',

The old man was the product of the devil’s lie. He was the product of deception. His whole nature is deception and corruption. He is the product of the serpent. The old man is just as crooked as the snake that brought him into being. There is no truth in him—he is crooked to the core. The more he tries to be straight, the more crooked he becomes.\nWhat is the solution? The old man was crucified so that the new man might be brought forth. Ephesians 4:22 instructs us to “put off…\nthe old man” ; then, in verse 24, we are exhorted to “put on…the new man.”  This is the exchange. The old set of clothing goes; the new set of clothing is put on.\nEphesians 4:24 goes on to describe the new man as having “true righteousness and holiness.”  I would like to restate the verse in this way:\n“Who, after God, is created in righteousness and true holiness.” More literally, “Who, in accordance with God’s plan [God’s standards, God’s thinking, or God’s purpose, however you would like to understand it], was created in righteousness and holiness of truth.” The new man is the product of the truth of God’s Word concerning Jesus Christ. The truth, received into our hearts by faith, brings forth a new man, which brings forth righteousness and holiness. The new man was created in accordance with God’s standards, or purpose, in righteousness and holiness, which are products of the truth. ',

If so, a lot of us would be left out, myself included! Is there any one of us who is truly born of God of whom it could be said, “He cannot commit sin”? I do not believe so. What, then, is the meaning of this verse?\nMy understanding is that it is talking about the new nature that has been born in us. This is a nature that cannot sin—the Jesus nature.\nIt is the new man. This is very important to realise because only as we cultivate and yield to that nature do we come into a life of victory over sin.\nIn 1 John 5:4, we read, “For whatever is born of God overcomes the world.”  Notice that John specified “whatever is born of God,”  not whoever.  He was referring to a person, but also to a nature. That is my understanding. It is the nature of the new man. This new nature cannot sin; it is incorruptible. Do you know why it is incorruptible? God’s seed remains in the new man. What is the seed? We find out in 1 Peter 1:23,\n“Having been born again, not of corruptible seed but incorruptible, through the word of God which lives and abides forever.”\nWhat is the nature of the seed of God’s Word?

When the flesh of Jesus was pierced and torn on the cross, the veil was parted.\nIn this present age, Christ is revealed in the believer; He lives in the believer but He is still veiled by the flesh. The book of Colossians gives us another aspect of this truth. In speaking about the new man—\nthat is, who we are in Christ, members of the new race—Paul said to the believers,\nYou have put off the old man with his deeds, and have put on the new man who is renewed in knowledge according to the image of Him who created him.\n(Colossians 3:9–10)\nI prefer to make it more literal: “who is being renewed.” Renewal is a continuous process that takes place in the present. We are going through a process in order to be renewed.\nThen, it says, literally, “into the acknowledgment of the Creator.” It is not just knowing Jesus intellectually, but also acknowledging Him in every area of our lives, that brings His image into us.\nThe end purpose of the process of renewal is for us to reproduce His image. I believe this is a perfectly justifiable paraphrase. Let’s repeat it: “Being renewed into the acknowledgment of the Creator so as to reproduce His image.” In other words, the end purpose is to restore the image that was marred by the fall. Of course, the consummation of this purpose will come at the resurrection, when even the physical body of the believer will be transformed into the likeness of Christ’s resurrection body. ',

This leads us to consider the next major effect that God’s Word produces.\nIn every realm of life, there is one unchanging law: as soon as a new life is born, the first and greatest need of that new life is nourishment to sustain it. For example, when a human baby is born, that baby may be sound and healthy in every respect, but unless he quickly receives nourishment, he will languish and die.\nThe same law is true in the spiritual realm. When a person is born again, the new spiritual nature produced within that person immediately requires spiritual nourishment, both to maintain life and to promote growth. The spiritual nourishment God has provided for all His born-again children is found in His own Word. God’s Word is so rich and varied that it contains nourishment adapted to every stage of spiritual development. God’s provision for the first stages of spiritual growth is described in the first epistle of Peter. Immediately after Peter wrote in chapter 1 about being born again of the incorruptible seed of God’s Word, he went on to say,  “Therefore, laying aside all malice, all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and all evil speaking, as newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that you may grow thereby” (1 Peter 2:1–2).\nFor newborn spiritual babes in Christ, God’s appointed nourishment is the pure milk of His own Word.

My brothers, can a fig tree bear olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water.\n(James 3:9–12 niv)\nJames combined two pictures there. One is of a tree.

The tree, in that picture, is the heart; the fruit is the words that come out of the mouth. The second picture James used is that of a spring of water. He said that if brackish, salty water comes out of a spring, you know the water in the spring is salty.\nThe two trees represent two natures. A tree that produces fruit different from what it should produce is corrupt; that tree represents the old man. A good tree is the new man in Jesus Christ. The old man cannot bring forth good fruit.

Jesus. Notice the order there. We are chosen, predestined, adopted, and accepted. Say these steps aloud: “I am chosen, predestined, adopted, accepted.” I am aware that some of the modern translations do not use the word accepted. The Greek phrase translated as “He made us accepted”  means, “God has bestowed His favor upon us totally.” Again, when the angel Gabriel saluted the Virgin Mary, he said,  “Rejoice, highly favored one”  (Luke 1:28). Favored is the same Greek word as in Ephesians, and “accepted” is a good way to translate it. We are not merely tolerated by God. We are not just standing on the sidelines. Rather, we are the objects of His highest favor. Can you believe that? It is incredible.\nIn my opinion, feelings of insecurity are linked directly to the problem of rejection.

One of the greatest single changes we need to make is rethinking our picture of what it means to be a Christian. It means to be a member of God’s family. Not just in some nice theological phrase, but in the membership of a real family.\nTo be lonely is a very unhappy condition. Yet, in today’s world, there are millions and millions of lonely people. Even though the population of the earth is increasing rapidly, and even though many people live in large cities, these large cities and this highly populated earth of ours are filled with lonely people.\nIt is possible to be lonely even in the midst of a crowd. It is possible to be lonely in a big city. In fact, that is the worst form of loneliness—\nto be surrounded by people, and, at the same time, to feel cut off from them by an invisible barrier that you have no idea how to break through.\nLoneliness is not God’s plan for the life of any individual. From eternity, God is a Father. The source of all fatherhood—of every family, in heaven and on earth—is God. As Paul wrote in Ephesians 3:15,\n“From [God]  the whole family in heaven and earth is named.”  Right at the beginning of human history, God provided a mate for the first man because He decided, “It is not good that man should be alone” (Genesis 2:18).

    "body": 'We are all members of God’s family because we all have one Father. Jesus is our elder brother, and we are all members of the same family.\nLet me relate a little incident that comes to mind when I think about the family of God. It happened in the days when some of the Scottish Christians up in the Highlands were being severely persecuted by the English army. On her way to a secret meeting of believers, a Scottish lass was arrested by an English policeman, who asked her where she was going. She did not want to lie, but she also did not want to betray her fellow believers, so she lifted her heart to the Lord in prayer and asked Him for an answer. This is how she responded to the policeman:\n“My elder brother died, and I am on my way to my father’s house to hear the will read.”\nThat was a good answer. Jesus is the elder brother, God is our Father, and it is our Father’s house.\nWhat is the essential feature of the family? I believe it is a shared life source. God the Father is the life source of us all, and we are together in His family. It is not an institution, not an organization, but a life source that we all share.\nWhat is required of us, as members of God’s family? I suggest that it is mutual acceptance. Jesus calls us His brothers because God calls us His sons. If God calls our fellow believers His sons, we have to call them our brothers. That is not always easy. You may choose your friends, but you do not choose your family. Even so, we must accept one another. ',

But, friends, it does not matter if nobody wanted you, nobody loved you, or your parents were not even married. When you come to God through Jesus Christ, you become a member of the best family in the universe, and God has no second-class children.\nGod’s family is the best family. There is no family quite equal to it. Again, even if your own family did not care for you—perhaps your father rejected you, your mother never had time for you, or your husband never showed you affection—God wants you. You are accepted. You are the object of His special care and affection. Remember, everything He does in the universe revolves around you.\nAs I wrote earlier, when God says that we are accepted, He does not mean tolerated.  We never bother Him. We do not upset Him or disturb Him. We never take too much of His time. The only thing that upsets Him is when we stay away too long.\nHe does not push us off into a corner and say, “Wait. I’m too busy. I don’t have time for you.” Rather, He welcomes us eagerly and lovingly. ',

The father was out there looking for his boy to bring him back home. Other people did not have to come and say, “Your son’s come home!” because the first one to know it was the father. He knew it before the rest of the family found out.\nGod’s attitude toward us in Christ is like that. We are not rejects.\nWe are not second-class citizens. We are not just servants. When the prodigal came back, he was willing to be a servant. But his father would not hear of it. On the contrary, he said,\nBring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet. And bring the fatted calf here and kill it, and let us eat and be merry; for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.\n(verses 22 –24)\nThe whole household was turned upside down to welcome the prodigal.\nLikewise, Jesus said,  “There will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent”  (verse 7 niv). That’s how God welcomes us in Christ. ',

You might change your mind, but God does not change His.\nThere is a great deal of misplaced emphasis in many contemporary presentations of the gospel that seems to indicate that everything depends on what we do. It is true that we have to choose, but we would never be able to choose if God had not chosen us in the first place. You will find you are much more secure as a Christian when you are basing your relationship with God not on what you do but on what God has done.

In this beautiful passage from Psalms, David began with what seems like a gasp of astonishment:\nO Lord, Thou hast searched me and known me. Thou dost know when I sit down and when I rise up; Thou dost understand my thought from afar. Thou dost scrutinize my path and my lying down, and art intimately acquainted with all my ways. Even before there is a word on my tongue, behold, O Lord, Thou dost know it all. Thou hast enclosed me behind and before, and laid Thy hand upon me. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is too high, I cannot attain to it. Where can I go from Thy Spirit?\nOr where can I flee from Thy presence? (Psalm 139:1–7 nasb) Think about what David said: God knows our thoughts from a distance. A man who once had a revelation of God related that the angel who brought the revelation told him, “Men’s thoughts sound as loud in heaven as their voices do on earth.” That was a shock to me. But that is essentially what David said here.\nSurely, when we consider all of that, we must echo these words of David: “Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is too high, I cannot attain to it.”  David asked, “Where can I go from Thy Spirit?”  That is the key that explains how God knows everything in the whole universe—\nthrough His Spirit.

When the disciples told Jesus,  “We have come to believe and know that You are the Christ [Messiah] , the Son of the living God”  (John 6:69), Jesus gave them an answer in which He revealed that being the Messiah would entail being betrayed by one of His own followers: “‘Did I not choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?’ He spoke of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, for it was he who would betray Him, being one of the twelve”\n(John 6:70–71). Jesus knew, by the Holy Spirit, that Judas would betray Him, even before Judas knew it himself.\nEven so, Judas could not carry out his plan until Jesus spoke a word that released him to do so. At the Last Supper, Jesus warned His disciples, “One of you will betray Me” (John 13:21). When questioned about who it would be, Jesus replied,\n“It is he to whom I shall give a piece of bread when I have dipped it.” And having dipped the bread, He gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon. Now after the piece of bread, Satan entered him.\nThen Jesus said to him, “What you do, do quickly.”…Having received the piece of bread, he then went out immediately.\n(John 13:26–27, 30)\nI am awed by the realization that Judas could not carry out his plan to betray Jesus until Jesus Himself spoke the word that released him to do it.

The King James Version refers to the “bowels of compassion”  (1 John 3:17). The “bowels of compassion” are where our deepest feelings lie—not in the physical heart, but in the gut. This is where it all begins. This is the source of everything.\nWhen my first wife, Lydia, was writing her autobiography, she used the phrase, “My bowels were moved.” The editors of the book had to explain that this was not the right way to express that feeling in English. But in every other language I know—Latin, Greek, Hebrew—\nthe deepest, innermost part of you is not referred to as the heart but the bowels.

Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself.\n(Philippians 2:1–3)\nThose are very powerful words. Paul was not talking about superficial feelings. They go deep.\nI have met many wonderful ministers, but the primary driving force of today’s church, as I see it, is ambition: ambition to build a bigger church, to hold a larger meeting, to put more names on the mailing list, or to make oneself known. Maybe I am being cynical, but, nevertheless, ambition seems to be a primary force in contemporary Christianity.\nHowever, Paul said, “Let nothing be done through selfish ambition.”\nI have a question for those of you in the Lord’s service. It is, by extension, a question for everyone, for all believers are to be in the Lord’s service. By what are you moved? What prompts you to do the things you do? To speak the words you speak? To relate to people the way you do? Are you motivated by the love of God and by compassion?\nFirst John 4:7–8 exhorts us, “Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God.” ',

Something entirely new happened within me—a spring was opened inside me that was a fountain of compassion. I had known the love of God for a long time, and I had always loved my family, but this spring was unlike anything I had ever experienced.\nThis spring had another source apart from Derek Prince. I began to understand what the Bible means when it says that Jesus was “moved with compassion.”  (See, for example, Matthew 9:36; Mark 1:41.) I realised God was sharing His compassion with me, and I prayed, “Lord, let this fountain never become defiled or contaminated, and let it never become stopped up.” God alone determined when it would spring up.\nAnd when the fountain of compassion is flowing within me, it attracts people to me. They do not know why they are drawn to me, but they sense something for which they have been longing. I believe that God is waiting for us to love one another with His divine love.\nGod has done something else in me, too. He has given me a supernatural concern for orphans, widows, the poor, and the oppressed.\nWe can talk about faith and righteousness, but if we do nothing for the people who really need us, these words are empty and meaningless.\nThere is no shortage of people who need us. They are all around us—\npeople who need to be loved are everywhere. They are lonely; no one cares for them; they lack answers and are desperate. You don’t have to go far from home to find people like that. Compassion is the purpose of God. It is what He’s waiting to see manifest in us. ',

Many professing Christians, however, could be guilty of these sins.  “If I have kept the poor from their desire, or caused the eyes of the widow to fail, or eaten my morsel by myself, so that the fatherless could not eat of it…” (Job 31:16–17).\nNotice the three groups that Job listed: the poor, the widows, and the fatherless (or orphans). Job said, in essence, “If I have not done what I ought to have done for them, I am a sinner, and I have failed my basic obligations.” He went on,\n(But from my youth I reared him as a father, and from my mother’s womb I guided the widow); if I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing, or any poor man without covering; if his heart has not blessed me, and if he was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep; if I have raised my hand against the fatherless, when I saw I had help in the gate; then let my arm fall from my shoulder, let my arm be torn from the socket.\n(verses 18–22)\nJob did not fail to care for the people who had no food, clothing, or families to care for them. Then, he said that if his arm were not engaged continually in these acts of mercy and generosity, it had no place in his body at all. His viewpoint is totally different from the viewpoint most people have today. This was the standard of righteousness of the patriarchs, too, even before the law of Moses and even before the gospel.\nGod requires us to restore this kind of righteousness in the church by going out of our way to care for widows, orphans, and those with no food, clothing, or shelter.

The blessing of a perishing man came upon me, and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy. I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; my justice was like a robe and a turban. I was eyes to the blind, and I was feet to the lame.

The spirit of slavery makes us fearful of punishment; the Spirit of adoption leads us as God’s children.\nThe Greek word that is translated as sons indicates a “mature son.”\nWhen you are first born again of God’s Spirit, you become a child.\nBut as you are led, you become a mature son or daughter of God. The pathway to maturity is being led by the Holy Spirit, no longer bound under a spirit of slavery. As Paul wrote in Galatians 5:18, “But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.”\nIn order to become a mature son or daughter of God, you must be led by the Spirit. But remember, if you are led by the Holy Spirit, you are not under the law. That is our freedom—not a freedom to do evil, but a freedom to love. Our motivation to do service for Jesus is love, the most powerful motivator in the world. It works even when fear does not. That’s what God is bringing us to.

    "body": 'When you receive Jesus Christ, you become a child of God, and you also receive the “Jesus nature,” a nature that knows to call God the Father “Daddy.” This is a very natural relationship.\nIn Romans 8, Paul addressed two major subjects—birth and adoption. Do not confuse them; they are distinctly different. Birth produces a nature; adoption gives a legal standing.\nGod is so good to us that we get it both ways—birth and adoption—\nbut they don’t give us the same thing. We receive something distinct by each process.\nThis is perfectly understandable in the light of the customs of the Roman Empire. In Paul’s day, it was not uncommon for the Roman emperor to have many sons, but when he chose one particular son to succeed him as emperor, he would also adopt that son. Then, all the legal rights of the empire would go to that adopted son. The purpose of adoption was legal—it assured the son’s inheritance.\nWe are born again at regeneration, and we receive the “Jesus nature.” But, at the baptism in the Holy Spirit, we receive adoption.\nHeaven’s best Lawyer comes in and assures us that we are the children of God. This is what assures us of the inheritance we receive. Do you see the implication?\nIt is just like the Roman emperor. If he has a son by natural birth, his son gets his nature. But in order to receive the inheritance, that son needs to be adopted; this gives him a legal standing and rightful inheritance.\nThank You, Father, that I am Your child.

But Paul contradicted this idea in the eighth chapter of Romans, where he wrote that all who are led regularly by the Holy Spirit are indeed sons of God.  “For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God” (Romans 8:14). In one sense, if you are  already  perfect, you do not need the Holy Spirit. You need the Holy Spirit, though, if you are to become perfect.\nThe way to live as a real son or daughter of God is to be led regularly by the Holy Spirit. As Jesus said, “My sheep hear My voice,…and they follow Me”  (John 10:27). By “hear,”  Jesus meant regularly hear, regularly follow. This is not an up-and-down, once a week process; rather, it is a regular, continuing relationship.\nPaul continued in Romans 8:15, “For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, ‘Abba, Father.’”  The “spirit of bondage,”  very simply, is the law. Instead of being bound by the law, you have received the Spirit of God, who assures you of your identity as a child of God. As a child of God, you have all the rights of the inheritance. Paul assured us, “The Spirit Himself bears witness with our [regenerated] spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs [inheritance is the subject];\nheirs of God and joint heirs with Christ” (verses 16–17).\nMany people receive assurance of being children of God only when they are baptized in the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit comes in to assure you that you are a child of God and that you have a legal right to your inheritance. You are not merely born, but you are also adopted, and this passage clearly connects adoption and inheritance. ',

There is a direct correspondence in time periods between the deliverance of Israel out of Egypt and the experience of the early Christians.\nThe Passover lamb’s execution corresponds to the day on which Jesus died.\nThe crossing of the Red Sea corresponds to Jesus’ resurrection from the grave.\nThe receiving of the Law at Mount Sinai, fifty days after the Passover, corresponds to the outpouring of the Spirit at Pentecost.\nI point this out because when you have been delivered through the blood and through the resurrection of Jesus, you have two choices: you can go to Sinai, or you can go to Pentecost. Quite a lot of people go to Sinai—they go back under the law. They “receive the spirit of bondage again to fear”  (verse 15).

We read in 2 Timothy,\nThis is a faithful saying: For if we died with Him, we shall also live with Him. If we endure [suffer] , we shall also reign with Him. If we deny Him, He also will deny us. If we are faithless, He remains faithful; He cannot deny Himself. (2 Timothy 2:11–13) So, we see that if we suffer, we will reign; but if we deny Jesus Christ, He will deny us. There come times in our lives when we are challenged to either suffer with Him or deny Him, and the issues are put clearly before us. (See, for example, Acts 14:22; Philippians 1:29–30; 2 Thessalonians 1:4–10.)\nI have a beautiful picture that I would like to describe to you. It comes from the tabernacle, and it concerns three of the main colors, especially in the high priest’s garments: blue, purple, and scarlet. Blue is a type of heavenly color; scarlet is a type of human nature, as well as the blood; and purple is the perfect blending of blue and scarlet, which speaks of Christ as God incarnate. The blue of heaven and the scarlet of earth blend to make purple. This is a beautiful picture of the nature of Jesus Christ—both God and man, perfectly blended in a new color.\nThe significance of purple in Scripture is twofold: it signifies royalty and suffering.

Romans 8:23 reads,  “He [God] who did not spare His own Son [Jesus],  but delivered Him up for us all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all things?” (nasb). When we receive Christ, God freely gives us all things. Apart from Him, we receive nothing. There is a strong emphasis in this verse on the scope of the inheritance and its absolute freedom. We cannot earn it. We receive it as a free gift that includes all things. We are heirs of the total inheritance—all that God the Father has, all that God the Son has—when we receive Christ.\nIn his first epistle to the Corinthians, Paul tried to show the believers how rich they were. He actually rebuked them a little because they were acting as though they were poor. They were being mean, petty, and envious toward one another. Paul said, in effect, “You people don’t realise what you’ve got.”\n“So then let no one boast in men. For all things belong to you, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come; all things belong to you, and you belong to Christ; and Christ belongs to God” (1 Corinthians 3:21–23 nasb). What a breathtaking statement. Paul said, in effect, “All things belong to you. Stop acting petty and frivolous. Don’t get hung up on preachers, either. Stop being so small-minded. Everything is yours.” Remember, the gift of the inheritance is freely given to us; we cannot earn it. But it is important that we ask the Holy Spirit to enlarge our faith and understanding. The Holy Spirit is the administrator, and unless He speaks to us and guides us into the truth, these will just be words, not reality. The Holy Spirit makes the promises a reality. ',

B. Phillips translation of verse 15 reads, “From whom all fatherhood, earthly or heavenly, derives its name.”  This verse contains a tremendous revelation—that the fatherhood of God is eternal, named after the fatherhood of God in heaven and deriving its sanctity and authority from being a projection on earth of the divine, eternal fatherhood of God in heaven.\nBefore creation ever took place, God was already a Father—the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. This relationship of fatherhood and sonship within the Godhead is eternal. Before creation was brought into being, God was eternally a Father and Christ was eternally His Son. Every fatherhood in creation is named after the eternal fatherhood of God.\nIn a familiar verse from the gospel of John, Jesus said,  “In My Father’s house are many mansions” (John 14:2). This verse reveals the fact that God is a Father, and He has a house. In Scripture, however, the word  house  is never used primarily to indicate a physical, material building. Rather, it is always used of a family and the building they occupy. When Jesus said, “In My Father’s house,”  He was talking about God’s heavenly family. God is eternally a Father, and family life has its origin in eternity in the father/son relationship within the Godhead. ',

It is not an abstraction. It is not some mysterious force at work in the universe, but it is a Person creating another person in order to have fellowship with that person. To me, this so vividly brings out the fact that one main reason that God created man was to enjoy fellowship with him.\nPicture the scene! The Lord kneeled down, took dust in His hands, mixed it with water, and molded it into the body of a man. But it was lifeless! Then, something marvelous happened. The Creator leaned forward, put His divine lips against the lips of clay, pressed His divine nostrils against the nostrils of clay, and breathed life into them. His breath penetrated the form of clay and transformed it into a living human being with every organ of its body functioning perfectly, and with all the marvelous spiritual, intellectual, and emotional responses of which a human being is capable. No other being has ever been created in such a way.\nThe words used to describe this miracle are particularly vivid.\nThe Hebrew language is one in which the sounds of certain words relate directly to the action they name. The sound of the Hebrew word translated “breathed”  can be rendered yip-pach. It consists of a tiny, internal “explosion,” followed by a forceful, ongoing release of air from the throat. Thus, it vividly represents the action it names.\nAs the Lord stooped down over those lips and nostrils of clay, He did not let out a languid sigh. He exhaled a forceful breath into that body of clay, which thus received a miraculous impartation of the very life of God. ',

    "body": 'Let’s look for a moment at something the Bible says about the material out of which the human body is made. Some of you probably do not know that the Bible has quite a lot to say about that.\nIt always grieves me when Christians downgrade their own bodies and talk about them as if they were inferior or of little importance.\nBrothers and sisters, our bodies are miracles. If your car was totaled in a wreck and you had to replace it, all you would need is a certain amount of dollars and you could purchase a new car. But if you injure even one eye, there is no way you can pay for a new eye. It is priceless.\nSo it is with every other major organ of the body. It grieves me when I see Christians taking more care of their cars than they do of their bodies. That is a very foolish scale of values.\nPsalm 139 is a psalm that David wrote as a meditation on the marvels of his own body. David said to the Lord, I will praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; marvelous are Your works, and that my soul knows very well.\n(Psalm 139:14)\nDavid was talking about his physical body. I wonder if you would agree to say those same words about your own body. It would change the attitude of some of you. Some Christians are almost burdened down with their bodies. They seem to wish that they did not have the problem of a body. That is a false viewpoint. Say these words aloud right now: “I will praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.” ',

    "body": 'In the book of Job, we find a beautiful summation of God’s creative work in forming our bodies:\nYour hands have made me and fashioned me, an intricate unity; yet You would destroy me. Remember, I pray, that You have made me like clay. And will You turn me into dust again? Did You not pour me out like milk, and curdle me like cheese,…?\n(Job 10:8–11)\nAs in Genesis 2:7, where the word “ formed”  indicates a very careful, skillful work, so, too, Job emphasizes the immense skill and care that God devoted to forming the human body. What vivid expressions!\nVerses 10–11 say,  “Did You not…clothe me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews?”  What a beautiful picture of the interrelationship of the various main parts of the body. In Psalm 139, David wrote, “Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them” (verse 16 kjv).\nGod brought your body into being on a blueprint, and there is a number for every member. Every member is written up in God’s book.\nCompare that statement with what Jesus said in Luke 12:7: “But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not fear therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.”  Such is the intensity of God’s concern for our physical bodies—He takes an interest in even the smallest details.\nWhen we realise this truth, we must also realise that God has a purpose for the marvelous workmanships that are our own bodies.

    "body": 'What is the purpose for which our bodies were made? It is an important purpose, and the answer is exciting and simple. In his first epistle to the church at Corinth, Paul wrote, Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?\n(1 Corinthians 6:19)\nWhy did God design and create a body for man? The answer is amazing. He wanted the body of each redeemed believer to be a temple for Him to dwell in, through His Holy Spirit. Again, if you view your own body from that perspective, it will give you a totally different attitude toward it. Your body was designed to be a temple for God to inhabit.\nThe Bible tells us that God does not dwell in temples made with hands. (See Acts 7:48; 17:24.) You could build any building—a synagogue, a cathedral, a church, whatever you desire—but God will not live there. When God’s people meet in such buildings, God will be there with them, but He doesn’t live there. God has designed His own temple. What is it? Our bodies.\nIt is staggering to think that almighty God, the Creator of heaven and earth, wants to occupy our physical bodies and make them His temple.\nWhen Jesus was speaking about the Holy Spirit in John 7, He said,\n“‘He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.’ (But this spake he of the Spirit…)”  (verse 38\nkjv).

You no longer decide where your body will go. You no longer decide what your body will do. You no longer decide what your body will eat or what it will wear. You have given up the right to make those decisions. From now on, your body no longer belongs to you—it belongs to God. You have sacrificed it, living, to Him on His altar.\nWhatever is placed on the altar of God belongs to God from that point on. It no longer belongs to the person who gave it. That is what God requires: that we sacrifice our bodies, just as Jesus sacrificed His body. The difference is that Jesus sacrificed His body through death, while we are asked to sacrifice our bodies when still alive—to hand them over to God, to give up our rights and our claims to them.\nNow, that concept may sound very frightening. But I want to tell you that it is very exciting. God has all sorts of ideas about what He will do with you and your body. But He is not going to tell you until your body belongs to Him.

I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you.\n(niv)\nThe Jewish people are the touchstone by which all other nations are going to be judged.

Any nation that opposes God’s purpose for the restoration of Zion will be put to shame and turned backward. Nations determine their destinies by how they respond to the restoration of God’s people.\nA beautiful and familiar promise of blessing for those who align themselves with God’s purposes for Jerusalem, for Israel, and for God’s people is found in Psalm 122:6: “Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee” (kjv). We cannot merely take a neutral attitude and say, “Let’s see what happens.” We have to actively align ourselves with what God is saying in His Word and what He is doing in history.\nThe primary way in which we can do this is through our prayers.\nWe can pray for the peace of Jerusalem and for its restoration—for Jerusalem to become all that God has declared in the Scriptures that it shall be.

    "body": 'The Bible exhorts us to seek the good of Israel through our prayers.\nTo pray effectively in this way, we need to search out from the Scriptures God’s purposes for Israel and Jerusalem. Then, we need to set ourselves to pray intelligently and consistently for the outworking and fulfillment of those purposes. As we make this scriptural study, we will discover that, ultimately, righteousness and peace are ordained to flow forth from Jerusalem to all the nations of the earth. Thus, the well-being of every nation is included in this prayer for Jerusalem and depends on its fulfillment.\nA challenging scriptural example of this kind of praying was provided by Daniel, who prayed three times daily with his window open toward Jerusalem. Daniel’s prayers disturbed Satan and threatened his kingdom such that he used the jealousy of evil men to bring about a change in the laws of the entire Persian Empire so that Daniel’s prayers would be rendered illegal. Still, praying for Jerusalem meant so much to Daniel that he preferred to be cast into the lions’ den rather than give up his praying. Ultimately, Daniel’s faith and courage overcame the satanic opposition. He emerged triumphant from the lions’ den—and kept praying for Jerusalem.\nFrom my own experience of many years, I have discovered that making a commitment of this kind to pray for Jerusalem and Israel definitely stirs up a special measure of opposition from satanic forces.\nOn the other hand, I have also discovered that God’s promise given to those who pray in this way holds true.\nThis is a scriptural pathway to prosperity—not merely financial or material prosperity, but also a prosperity that encompasses an abiding assurance of God’s favor.

    "body": 'The call to pray for Jerusalem is directed at everyone who accepts the Bible as God’s authoritative Word. God requires all of His people, from every nation and every background, to be concerned about the peace of one particular city: Jerusalem. There is a practical reason for this. God’s purpose for this age will climax in the establishment of His kingdom. Each time we pray the familiar words, “Thy kingdom come,”\nwe are aligning ourselves with this purpose. (See, for example, Matthew 6:10 kjv.)\nWe must remember, however, that the prayer continues, “Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven”  (verse 6:10 kjv). It is on earth that God’s kingdom is to be established. His kingdom is invisible as yet to human eyes, but it is not vague or amorphous. It will ultimately have a tangible, earthly realization. The capital and center of God’s kingdom on earth will be the city of Jerusalem. The administration of righteous government will go forth from Jerusalem to all nations on earth.\nIn response, the gifts and worship of these nations will flow back to Jerusalem. Thus, the peace and prosperity of all nations depend on that of Jerusalem. Until Jerusalem enters into her peace, no nation on earth can know true, lasting peace.\nTo all who heed God’s call to love Jerusalem and pray for her peace, God gives a special, precious promise:  “They shall prosper” (Psalm 122:6\nkjv). The word translated  “prosper”  goes beyond the material realm. It denotes a deep, inner well-being, a freedom from care and anxiety. As we align ourselves with God’s plan by praying for Jerusalem, we experience a foretaste of His peace. A sense of inner rest and peace comes to those who, in the midst of all the turmoil of this world, associate themselves actively with God’s plans to restore His people. ',

You who call on the Lord, give yourselves no rest, and give him no rest till he establishes Jerusalem and makes her the praise of the earth.\n(Isaiah 62:6–7 niv)\nIn the New Testament, Jesus related the parable of the unjust judge, whom a widow kept beseeching incessantly. Jesus concluded with this question: “And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night?” (Luke 18:7 niv). Both these passages indicate that some themes are so important and urgent that they demand our prayers not only in the daytime, but through the night hours, as well. The restoration of Jerusalem is one of these themes.\nThe prophet Isaiah also described these “watchmen”  as those “who call on the Lord.”  The literal Hebrew meaning of the word translated\n“call”  is interesting. It means “those who  remind the Lord.” In modern Hebrew, it is the word for a secretary. One important task of a secretary is reminding the employer of the appointments recorded on his calendar. This provides practical insight into the way God wants us to pray for Jerusalem. As His “intercessor-secretaries,” we have two main responsibilities: first, to be familiar with His prophetic calendar; second, to remind Him of the appointments recorded in it. One such appointment is God’s end-time commitment to restore Israel and to rebuild Jerusalem. ',

In Isaiah 40:1–2, God said, “‘Comfort, yes, comfort My people!’ says your God. ‘Speak comfort to Jerusalem, and cry out to her, that her warfare is ended, that her iniquity is pardoned; for she has received from the Lord’s hand double for all her sins.’”\nI have analyzed that verse, and where it says “comfort My people,”\nbecause of the immediate reference to Jerusalem, I understand it to mean the Jewish people. The Jewish people cannot be comforted apart from Jerusalem. Their hearts are totally bound up with the city of Jerusalem. So, if I am right, and “My people” is the Jewish people, to whom are these words spoken? They are spoken in the plural (in Hebrew) to somebody who would say, “Comfort My people.”  They must be spoken to people who accept the God of the Bible and the authority of His Word. Who can that be? You and me. People like us, believing Christians. What does God say? “Comfort My people, Israel.” God requires us to comfort Israel.\nI have been friends with a number of Jewish believers in Jesus, and one thing that they will point out to me is the fact that the church worldwide spends much more time criticizing Israel than comforting Israel. We were not called to criticize; rather, we have been commanded to comfort. Will you accept that responsibility?\nI believe this comforting is one way of preparing the way of the Lord. Centuries of prejudice, alienation, and misunderstanding must be broken down. They must be melted away by the warmth of real Christian love. I believe that is our assignment at this time. ',

This attribute is stated in Exodus 15:26, where the Lord said to Israel, “For I, the Lord, am your healer”  (nasb).\nThe phrase “your healer,”  in modern Hebrew, means “your doctor.”\nThe word used in Exodus 15:26 is precisely the same word as the modern Hebrew word for  doctor.  It has not changed its meaning in more than three thousand years of the history of the Hebrew language. The Lord said emphatically to Israel, “I am your doctor.”\nTwo things that do not change are the Lord’s name and the Lord’s covenant. The Lord’s position and function as the healer of His people is united with His name and His covenant. In other words, it never changes.\nMany centuries later, when Jesus came to Israel as its Savior and Redeemer, thereby fulfilling the promises of the Messiah, He again manifested God as the healer of His people. The healing ministry of Jesus did not proceed from Himself—it did not initiate with Him—\nbut it was the expression of God’s healing nature and God’s healing covenant with His people. The foundation of God’s provision of healing and health for His people is His Word, the Scriptures.\nHow important it is to see that God’s answer to our need is primarily in His Word! If we ignore His Word, then we really do not have any right to expect that He will meet our needs. But if we turn to His Word and seek Him through it, we will find that in His Word, He does meet all our needs—spiritual and physical. ',

We are not to judge other Christians; we are to pray for them.\nPsalm 122:7 says, “Peace be within your walls, prosperity within your palaces.”  I believe that this verse illustrates the divine order: when we have peace, we will have prosperity. When we are at war with one another—criticizing one another, turning against one another, and undermining one another—we will not know prosperity. First, peace; then, prosperity.\nVerse 8 reads, “For the sake of my brethren and companions, I will now say, ‘Peace be within you.’”\nI want to add one more basic principle. We need to escape from the tendency to be self-centered. Self-centeredness is the devil’s prison.\nThe more the devil gets you centered in yourself, the more he has you at his mercy. I have dealt with hundreds of people in deliverance from evil spirits, and I have found one almost universal feature of people who need deliverance—they are self-centered. By deliberate effort and choice of our own wills, we must break loose from being self-centered.\nWhat I love in verse 8 is the phrase, “For the sake of my brethren and companions.”  It is not enough that things are going well for me.

The curses begin with these words:  “If you do not obey the voice of the Lord your God,…all these curses will come upon you” (verse 15). They hinge on heeding or ignoring the voice of the Lord.\nObedience in worship is the appointed way to come into that attitude and relationship in which we really hear God’s voice. Or, to state it another way, we do not hear God’s voice unless we possess an attitude of worship. Then, in hearing God’s voice, we enter into His rest. Thus, worship is the way to rest. Only those who really know how to worship can really enjoy rest.\nThere remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God; for anyone who enters God’s rest also rests from his own work, just as God did from his. Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following their example of disobedience.\n(Hebrews 4:9–11 niv)\nScripture brings out the fact that because of disobedience, the people of God failed to enter into rest.

It determines what we will be throughout eternity.\nIsaiah had a vision of heaven with glorious creatures and the throne of the Lord. (See Isaiah 6.) Worship was conducted in heaven by creatures called seraphim (Hebrew, seraph), a word that relates directly to the word for fire.  These are fiery creatures close to the throne of God, and they cried out day and night, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord”\n(Isaiah 6:3). Each one had six wings, which they used impressively. With two wings, they covered their faces; with two other wings, they covered their feet; and, with the two remaining wings, they flew. (See verse 2.) I interpret covering the face and feet as the humility of worship; I interpret flying as acts of service.\nI believe in the importance of thanking God and praising Him out loud—even dancing, clapping, and singing. But there comes a time when I will put my “wings” over my face and over my feet in humble worship and listen to hear what God says.\n“Today, if you will hear His voice: do not harden your hearts” (Psalm 95:7–8). Develop an attitude of worship and learn to rest. Remember, the Spirit of the Lord is looking for a certain type of person—one whose heart is perfect toward God. Be that person of character, and God will show Himself strong on your behalf. ',

    "body": 'In Psalm 95:7, we are given two reasons that we should worship the Lord: “For he is our God and we are the people of his pasture, the flock under his care” (niv). The first reason to worship God is because He is God— our  God, the only being in the universe worthy of worship.\nWe can praise other men and women, but we must not worship them.\nWorship is the most distinctive way for us to relate to God as God.\nI am convinced that whatever we worship gains control of us.\nThe more we worship it, the more like it we become—and the more it gains power over us. If we do not worship God, how much is He really our God?\nThe second reason that we should worship Him is that  “we are the people of His pasture.”  Worship is the way in which we recognize Him as our God, and it is the appropriate response to His care for us. This psalm ends with a solemn warning:\nToday, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did at Meribah….For forty years I was angry with that generation; I said, “They are a people whose hearts go astray, and they have not known my ways.” So I declared on oath in my anger, “They shall never enter my rest.”\n(verses 7–8, 10–11 niv)\nThis passage sets before us two options: entering into true worship or refusing to do so. In worship, we hear God’s voice. Upon hearing and obeying His voice, we enter into rest. The inescapable conclusion is the importance of hearing God’s voice. As we read in Jeremiah 7:23,\n“This is what I commanded them, saying, ‘Obey My voice, and I will be your God’” (nasb). This is one of the simplest statements of what God requires: “Obey My voice, and I will be your God.” ',

    "body": 'The first “let us” statement in the book of Hebrews says,  “Therefore…\nlet us fear”  (Hebrews 4:1). Does that statement surprise or offend you? Most Christians have no room for fear.\nThe people responsible for bringing me to the Lord were a fine Christian couple who lived in Yorkshire, England. When I visited them after World War II, they were not doing well—spiritually. The man believed that there was no room for fear in the Christian life. I pointed out that it depends on the kind of fear you are talking about. Psalm 19\nsays, “The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever” (verse 9). There is never an end to that kind of fear. This man had decided never to use medicine, a position that conveys a sense of arrogance. I linked it with his attitude that rejected fear of any kind. Tragically, he developed diabetes, and his leg had to be amputated. He could hardly get over the shock that his faith had not brought him healing. I think the real problem was a failure to understand that a certain kind of fear is very much a part of the Christian life. The words in Hebrews, “let us fear,”\nare addressed to Christian believers, not unbelievers. Bear in mind that there is always a possibility of not getting what God has appointed for us. The entire verse says, “Therefore, since a promise remains of entering His rest, let us fear lest any of you seem to have come short of it.”\nEvery promise is two-sided. It offers you good, but if you fail to claim the promise, you are deprived of something. So much in the Christian life is the same way. The good is available, but there is always the possibility of missing it. I believe that we have to come with this attitude of fear if we are going to be able to enter into God’s rest. ',

For He has spoken in a certain place of the seventh day in this way: “And God rested on the seventh day from all His works”; and again in this place: “They shall not enter My rest.”\n(Hebrews 4:3–5)\nIn that passage,  “believed”  is in the past tense; “enter”  is in the present tense. Before we can enter into God’s rest, we must have already believed. We do not keep believing again; it is something that is done once. We have made the decision, and, on that basis, we can proceed to enter into rest. Those who must continually decide to believe anew do not qualify to enter into the rest. Only we who have believed enter into rest.\nFollowing up on this theme of rest, let’s turn to the Old Testament for a moment. Genesis 2:2 reads, “And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done.”  God’s rest is a ceasing from all the work He did. I believe that God did not rest because He was tired. Instead, He took pleasure in relaxation. He sat back, looked at everything He had made, and took time to enjoy it.\nHow many of us ever take the time to enjoy the things that we have done or made? Today, by the time they have done something, most people are busy starting the next thing. The pattern that God established, though, is taking time to enjoy whatever you do after you have finished it. Whatever it may be that you have done, it is godly to relax and enjoy it. In fact, the ability to relax is a divine ability. ',

From the Israelites, God demanded one day out of seven—a higher proportion than that which He demanded of their material possessions. How many people in the church today really give God one day out of seven? That is one reason that there are so many nervous breakdowns—there are frustrated, frantic, busy people who never get the job done.\nGod was the first One who rested. He worked, then rested. A Palestinian Arab friend of mine who owns many restaurants says,\n“God did not work because He had a family to support. And God did not rest because He was tired. It was on a much higher level than that.\nGod worked because He is a Creator.” God rested, I believe, because He wanted to enjoy what He had created. If we never take time to enjoy what we have created, we are in a miserable condition.\nWhich takes more faith: to work or to rest? Israel failed to enter into rest because of unbelief. Why can a Christian not rest? Also because of unbelief. That is the diagnosis of the problem.\nRelaxation comes in knowing that God initiated it. My wife and I used to go away on “vacation.” But vacation means you have nothing to do—it is taken from the word vacant.  Sometimes, though, it is good to have nothing to do. But my wife and I felt that vacation  was the wrong word to use. Instead, we called these periods holidays, which means “holy day.” God showed us that it is a sin to never take a holiday.\nIn Israel’s calendar, as God ordained it, many holidays were required.\nThere were no options. They are God-ordained holidays—not because someone wants to be lazy, but because God has said to take a holiday. ',

The writer of Hebrews applied their situation to us, saying, “The word which they heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard it” (Hebrews 4:2). God’s Word can come to us, but it does us no good, nor does it accomplish God’s purposes of blessing, if it is not combined with faith. It takes faith to make the Word of God work in our lives.\nThe next verse says,  “For we who have believed do enter that rest”\n(verse 3). True faith brings us into rest. Do you have that rest of faith?\nHave you met those conditions, or are you in danger of being like the Israelites, who hardened their hearts? Because of their unbelief, they missed all that God had for them. What a tragedy if that should happen to us today! Yet the writer of Hebrews makes it very clear that it can happen—indeed, that it will happen—if we are not diligent about entering that rest.\nA little further on in Hebrews, we have the practical application of this lesson: “Let us therefore be diligent to enter that rest, lest anyone fall according to the same example of disobedience” (Hebrews 4:11).\nYou may have heard me say, “When you find a therefore  in the Bible, you need to find out what it is ‘there for.’” The above verse begins with a “therefore.” The point is, let us not go astray in the same way that the Israelites did in the Old Testament. Let’s guard ourselves against unbelief. Let’s be diligent and apply ourselves to walking in faith, conserving and cultivating our faith, strengthening and encouraging one another’s faith. Let’s not make the same terrible and tragic error that Israel made through unbelief. Bear in mind that there is a direct, causal connection between unbelief and disobedience. ',

And they fell in the wilderness.\nScripture says that their carcasses fell in the wilderness because of unbelief and disobedience. (See Numbers 14:29, 32.) And through unbelief and disobedience, they failed to hear the voice of the Lord.\nThey had the externals, but they did not have the great essential, inner reality of all true religion—hearing the voice of the Lord.\nSo, that was the mistake of Israel—a tragic mistake. After saying,\n“Let us fear” (Hebrews 4:1), the writer of Hebrews went on—still on the basis of the example of Israel—to say, “Let us be diligent.” I believe that is very natural. If we really take to heart the dangers of that spiritual condition and do fear, in that sense, the next thing we will naturally do is become diligent.\nLet’s consider for a moment what diligence is. One way to find out the meaning of a word is to consider what its opposite is. An obvious opposite of diligence is laziness. The Bible does not have one good word to say about laziness. It is a theme that does not receive enough attention in contemporary Christendom. ',

We not only need to be diligent, but we also need to be diligent to the very end. The opposite of diligence is stated there in plain words:\n“to become lazy.”  Not physically lazy, but spiritually lazy.\nFor this very reason, make every effort [“giv [e] all diligence”\nnkjv]  to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness; and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, love. (2 Peter 1:5–7 niv) The Christian life is not static. It is a life of adding, growth, and progress. To be static in the Christian life is to backslide. To do that adding, as described in the passage above, requires diligence. It requires making every effort. Peter then went on with an if: For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. But if anyone does not have them, he is nearsighted and blind, and has forgotten that he has been cleansed from his past sins.\n(verses 8–9 niv)\nWould you believe that it is possible for somebody to be cleansed from his past sins and then forget that it even happened?

In light of this condition, Peter continued with a  therefore.  This therefore relates to the warning that Peter had given:\nTherefore, my brothers, be all the more eager to make your calling and election sure. For if you do these things, you will never fall, and you will receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\n( 2 Peter 1:10–11 niv)\nThat is good news. There are things we can do that will guarantee we never fall, and also that we will have a rich welcome into the kingdom of our Lord.\nBasically, the condition about which we are warned is laziness. I am deeply troubled by the lack of concern in Christian circles about laziness. The majority of Christians view drunkenness with horror.\nThey would reject any person who professed to being a Christian if he were drunk. While I agree that drunkenness is a sin, and while I certainly don’t condone it, I believe that laziness is much more severely condemned in the Scripture than drunkenness.

One condition, the Lord meets; the other, we meet.\nBoth conditions must be fulfilled in order for us to attain the result. The condition the Lord meets is stated in Proverbs 10:22: “It is the blessing of the Lord that makes rich, and He adds no sorrow to it” (nasb).\nThe great, primary condition for true riches—spiritual and otherwise—is the blessing of the Lord. We cannot count on anything being really good apart from the blessing of the Lord. On the other hand, the blessing of the Lord, by itself, is not sufficient. In Proverbs 10:4, we read, “Poor is he who works with a negligent hand, but the hand of the diligent makes rich” (nasb). It takes the Lord’s blessing plus our own diligence to attain to true wealth. It is not enough to simply expect the blessing of the Lord, or even to receive the blessing of the Lord. It will not accomplish its purpose in your life unless you add to it your own personal diligence. Remember, diligence is the opposite of laziness.\nThat is a verse I have proved true in my own experience through decades of Christian living. I have been in many different situations, in many different forms of ministry, and in many different lands and continents, and I think I can say that, by the grace of God, I have always displayed diligence in things great and small. In every situation with which I have been involved, I have left it in better condition—\nspiritually, financially, and in every obvious way—than the condition it was in when I found it. The blessing of the Lord makes rich, but also the hand of the diligent makes rich. Add those two together and you have true spiritual riches. ',

In other words, when God makes a promise, He says, “If you will do this, then I will do that.” We have no right to claim the promise unless we first meet the condition He puts forth.\nWe need to see that the fulfillment of God’s promises does not depend upon our circumstances, but upon our fulfilling God’s conditions. We must keep our eyes on the conditions, making sure that we fulfill them instead of being influenced by the circumstances that might prevent us from doing so.\nLet’s look at the example of Abraham. God had promised Abraham a son who was to be his heir, but he reached the age of ninety-nine, and still no heir had come. (On his own, he produced Ishmael, but he was not to be the heir.) Why did God allow Abraham to reach such an old age before He fulfilled His promise? Why does God often allow us to come to a position of seeming impossibility before He fulfills the promises we are claiming?\nFirst, we are emptied of excessive self-confidence. We realise that if something is going to be done, God will be the only one who can do it. Abraham’s own body was worthless in terms of procreation, as was the womb of his wife. There was no natural way that the promise could be fulfilled. Abraham had to focus his eyes exclusively on God, the only one capable of fulfilling the promise.\nSecond, when the promise is finally fulfilled, all the glory goes to God. Remember, the purpose of the promises is that God may be glorified. When there is a possibility of us doing something on our own, we might be tempted to take the credit. But when we come to the place where we know we cannot do it by our own effort, we are exhausted of self-confidence, and all the glory truly goes to God. ',

    "body": 'Diligence is a fruit that has to be cultivated. Here are some brief directions about how it should be cultivated.\nIn 2 Timothy 2:6, Paul said, “The hard-working farmer must be first to partake of the crops [produce, fruit] .”  Here, Paul was bringing out a simple, basic fact: cultivating crops takes hard work. It is not done without effort. That fact is equally true of the fruit of the Spirit—to cultivate it requires hard work. I want to suggest two ways in which we can cultivate spiritual fruit in our lives.\nFirst, we need to study God’s Word, for it is the basis of all God’s provision for us. If we are not familiar with His Word, we almost inevitably forgo many of His provisions. Again, Paul wrote to Timothy,\n“Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth”  (2 Timothy 2:15).\nIn order to divide, or handle, the word of truth—Scripture, the Word of God—accurately, we must be workers. In a certain sense, we have to roll up our sleeves and get to work.\nThe second direction we must follow is to spend time in prayer. By prayer, I don’t mean merely talking to God, but listening—something that is just as important, if not more so, than talking to Him. Here, again, Jesus provided us with the perfect pattern. The whole basis of Jesus’ earthly ministry was His relationship with His Father. In order to cultivate and maintain that relationship, Jesus took plenty of time in prayer. Very often, it was early in the morning. It was there that He heard the Father’s voice and received direction for His ministry. ',

Scripture says that we are all members of one body, and we all need one another. (See, for example, Romans 12:4–5.) I often think of David going out to meet Goliath, taking just five smooth stones from the brook as weapons.\nWhy did those stones have to be smooth? They would not have been accurate missiles if they had not been smooth, and inaccuracy might have cost David his life. The stones were smooth because they had been lying in the brook, where water had been passing over them regularly.\nThey had been jostled against one another, and this action rubbed away their sharp edges.\nI believe that when the Lord Jesus Christ wants to find Christians He can use, He goes to the brook, where the pure water of God’s Word has been flowing over them, washing them, rounding them off. There, they have been in fellowship with one another, rubbing away the rough edges. Cultivating fellowship will make us into smooth stones.\nMy last recommendation is to submit to discipline. Fruit does not come in a person’s life without discipline. I have two main forms of discipline in mind. First, self-discipline—the way in which we organize our lives. This discipline includes even the simplest of things, such as when we get up in the morning, what we eat, what we wear, and personal cleanliness. Managing all these details is essential to cultivating fruit. Beyond that, I believe every Christian in normal situations should be subject to church discipline. He should be a member of a church, under the authority of the church leaders and subject to their discipline. ',

    "body": 'Jesus’ position as High Priest relates to our confession. Let’s look at three passages from the book of Hebrews. First, Hebrews 3:1 reads,\n“Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Christ Jesus.”  Jesus was the Apostle sent out by God to provide redemption. Having provided redemption, He returned to God to be our High Priest in the presence of God. He is the High Priest of our confession. That idea is radical: No confession, no High Priest. If we close our lips on earth, we silence our Advocate in heaven. The more we confess, the more we release His high priestly ministry on our behalf.\nNext, we’ll read Hebrews 4:14: “Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.”  To hold fast means to say something, then keep on saying it. Don’t back off. Don’t get discouraged.\nFinally, “Having a High Priest over the house of God,…let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful”  (Hebrews 10:21, 23). Notice the change there. It is not “the confession of our faith” but “the confession of our hope.”  If we confess\nfaith  long enough, it becomes  hope. “Faith is the substance of things hoped for”  (Hebrews 11:1). When we have built a substance of faith, then hope comes. My definition of biblical hope is “a confident expectation of good.” But we must hold fast the profession or confession without wavering. Why does it say “without wavering” ? Let me illustrate with the following image. When you are traveling in an airplane and the Fasten Seat Belt sign goes on, it tells you to expect turbulence. In the same way,  “without wavering”  tells you to expect opposition. The battle is fought and won when we maintain our confession.\nThank You, Jesus, that You are the High Priest of our confession.\nI proclaim that Jesus is my Advocate in heaven, in the presence of God, and I hold fast that confession without wavering.

    "body": 'I can illustrate “confession” from a book entitled Fear No Evil,  written by Natan Sharansky, a Jewish refusenik. Sharansky was not a Christian, but even so, the KGB (Soviet secret police) arrested him and put him through nine years of misery. As I read his story, I saw in the KGB the most vivid demonstration of Satan and his tactics. In Natan Sharansky, I recognized the way to win. He was a highly qualified chess player, and he decided to deal with the KGB as he would with a chess opponent: by staying one move ahead.\nThough he did not have a faith in a personal God, he did have a concept of God through his Jewish roots. Many Jewish prayers begin with “O Lord, our God, king of the universe.” In teaching himself Hebrew, he decided to write out a prayer that he could repeat whenever needed. It was a petition for God to be with him, protect his family, and bring him to Israel. Whenever he was under pressure—for instance, awaiting interrogation—he would repeat the prayer several times. He said that prayer about ten times a day for nine years—that amounts to more than thirty thousand times! How many Christians would go on praying the same prayer thirty thousand times?\nOne aim of the KGB was to get Sharansky to make the wrong confession. If he would just say that he was a traitor, they would release him. But he refused. The battle raged for nine years. By making the right confession and reiterating the right prayer, he won. Being victorious, he later immigrated to Jerusalem.\nHow that impressed me about Satan’s tactics! Satan uses every kind of pressure, every inducement, every lie—all with one aim: to get us to make the wrong confession. We defeat him, however, by maintaining the right confession.\nThank You, Jesus, that You are the High Priest of our confession. ',

    "body": 'Another word for  confession  is testimony.  We read in the book of Revelation, “They overcame him [Satan]  by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony” (Revelation 12:11).\nWe have acknowledged that we overcome Satan when we testify personally to what the Word of God says the blood of Jesus does for us. Testimony is a very simple thing—just saying words that agree with Scripture. Testimony saves us; it is our protection. I cannot overemphasize its importance.\nThe writer of Hebrews called Jesus the “High Priest of our confession”\n(Hebrews 3:1). Confession literally means “saying the same as.” For us, as believers in the Bible and in Jesus Christ, confession means saying with our mouths the same thing that God says in His Word. We make the words of our mouths agree with the Word of God. Jesus can advocate on our behalf only when we make the right confession. Whether we call it “testimony” or “confession,” it is indispensable in order for us to receive the salvation of God.\nJesus said,  “For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned” (Matthew 12:37). We settle our destinies by the words that we speak. James said the tongue is like the rudder on a ship; even though it is a small part of the ship, it determines exactly where the ship will go. (See James 3:4.) We determine the course of our lives by the way in which we use our tongues. We can say the right thing and make the words of our mouths agree with the Word of God, or we can say the wrong thing and cause our lives to go off course. We will either come safely to harbor or end in shipwreck according to how we use our tongues. ',

    "body": 'Jesus is the “High Priest of our confession” (Hebrews 3:1). Our confession enlists Jesus as our High Priest, but the opposite, unfortunately, is also true. If we make no confession, we have no High Priest. It’s not that Jesus has ceased to be our High Priest, but that we give Him no opportunity to minister as our High Priest.\nHe is the High Priest of our  confession.  If we say the right things with our mouths in faith, according to Scripture, then Jesus has eternally obligated Himself to see that we will never be put to shame—that we will always experience what we confess. But if we do not say the right things, then, alas, we silence the lips of our High Priest. He has nothing to say in heaven on our behalf.\nJesus is also called our “Advocate”  (1 John 2:1). The word advocate is similar to the modern word  attorney. Jesus is the legal expert who is there to plead our case in heaven. He has never lost a case. But if we do not make a confession, He has no case to plead, so the case goes against us by default.\nWe can see how important confession is; therefore, it is very important that we give heed to this third “Let us” passage in Hebrews:\n“Let us hold fast our confession”  (Hebrews 4:14). This principle of right confession has a central place in the gospel, as well as in our experience of salvation. In fact, there is no salvation without right confession.\nThank You, Jesus, that You are the High Priest of our confession. ',

    "body": 'In the tenth chapter of Romans, Paul explained as clearly as anywhere in the New Testament what is required for salvation. He began,\n“The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart” (that is, the word of faith which we preach): that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. (Romans 10:8–9) The basis for salvation is the Word, and it has to be appropriated by faith. Then, there are two things we must do—one with the heart, one with the mouth. We have to believe with the heart, but we have to confess, or say it out, with the mouth. Paul went on, For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.\n(Romans 10:10)\nYou see? No confession, no salvation. It is good to believe in the heart, but belief alone is not sufficient. We must not only believe in our hearts, but we must also say it out boldly with our mouths, making the words of our mouths agree with the Word of God. Our initial confession relates us to Jesus as High Priest, but His ongoing ministry on our behalf as High Priest depends on our ongoing confession. ',

    "body": 'The entire Bible shows that our words determine our destinies. As we read in Proverbs 18:21, “Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruit” (nasb). The tongue is either going to produce death in our lives, if we make a wrong confession, or life, if we make a right confession. Whatever we say with our tongues, we are going to eat the resultant fruit. That truth was echoed by the words of Jesus when He said, “And I say to you, that every careless word that men shall speak, they shall render account for it in the day of judgment.\nFor by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned” (Matthew 12:36–37 nasb).\nChristians often say silly things that are not honoring to God, and then excuse themselves by saying, “I didn’t really mean it.” But Jesus said, “Every careless word.”  It is not an excuse to say that you didn’t really mean something. We must hold fast our confession.\nUltimately, there are only two alternatives in our relationship to Christ and the Scripture: to confess or to deny. Again, Jesus said, Everyone therefore who shall confess Me before men, I will also confess him before My Father who is in heaven. But whoever shall deny Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father who is in heaven.\n(Matthew 10:32–33 nasb)\nThose are the two alternatives given to us. There is no third alternative. In spiritual things, in the long run, there is no neutrality.\nJesus said,  “He who is not with Me is against Me” (Matthew 12:30). We either we make the right confession to salvation, or we make the wrong confession, which will not produce salvation.\nThank You, Jesus, that You are the High Priest of our confession. I proclaim that I confess before men that Jesus is my Lord, and He confesses me before our Father, who is in heaven. ',

    "body": 'When the Bible says to hold fast your confession (see Hebrews 4:14), it is really issuing a warning that we will be subjected to pressures that might cause us to back off what we have said. But we should not back off. We should hold fast our confession, what we profess.\nFirst, we make the right confession, making the words of our mouths agree with the words of Scripture. We articulate what Jesus has done for us, exactly as the Word of God says. For instance, “By His stripes we are healed”  (Isaiah 53:5). “He became poor, that [we] …might become rich”  (2 Corinthians 8:9). “He tasted death that we might have life.” (See Hebrews 2:9.) “He took the curse that we might receive the blessing.” (See Galatians 3:13–14.) Those are the right confessions. We make them, and then, no matter what pressures come against us, no matter how much things may seem to go the wrong way, we  hold fast our confession. That is what makes our faith effective, and that is what releases the high priestly ministry of Jesus in heaven on our behalf.\nFaith relates us to that which our senses cannot perceive. As long as we are slaves of our senses, we really cannot move in faith. Paul said this clearly in 2 Corinthians 5:7: “For we walk by faith, not by sight.”  In other words, what we do, and the way in which we live as Christians, is based on faith—on what we believe, not on what we see or know from our senses. Our senses may tell us one thing, and our faith another—\nthat is when conflict comes. That is why the writer of Hebrews says to make your confession and then to hold it fast. Even if our senses tell us it is not so, if God’s Word says it is so, it is so. ',

    "body": 'This is the fourth “Let us” statement in Hebrews. I believe the fourth step is directly related to the first three steps, and that the sequence is significant. In order to be able to draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, we need to make sure that we have taken the first three steps.The first step is to fear: “Let us fear”  (Hebrews 4:1). Fearing means that we come with an attitude of reverence and an awareness of our need of God’s grace. Second, “Let us…be diligent” (Hebrews 4:11).\nThis is our response to God’s grace: we are not slack, lazy, indifferent, or presumptuous. God’s grace does not justify our indifference or presumption; rather, it provokes us to be diligent. The third step is:\n“Let us hold fast our confession” (Hebrews 4:14). We must have the right confession; we have to say with our mouths the truth about Jesus and what He has done for us.\nIn regard to our approaching the throne of grace, we are told to come for two things: mercy and grace. My conviction is that if God invites us to come, and if we meet the conditions I have outlined, then mercy and grace await us. We never need to be afraid; we will never be disappointed. God would never give an invitation that He would not stand behind and fulfill. If we come as God’s children, we do not come as beggars. God has no second-class children. He never holds us at a distance if we have met the conditions for approach. It is very important that we come with confidence. That is faith in action. It is faith that will not be denied. It is faith that takes God at His Word and believes that God is as good as His Word. It is faith in God’s faithfulness. That is how we are to approach the throne—with confidence. ',

    "body": 'It is important that we approach God without condemnation; in other words, boldly, because,  “if I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear” (Psalm 66:18).\nIf I “regard iniquity in my heart,”  it means that I come to God with a consciousness in my heart of something that condemns me. Every time I try to approach God with faith, Satan reminds me of something that is not right and that has not been dealt with—maybe a sin that has not been confessed, or, if it has been confessed, is still lingering because I have not claimed and received God’s forgiveness. I am therefore conscious of this thing in my heart all the time. And if I come with condemnation, I do not receive that for which I pray.\nI must remove the consciousness of sin from within my heart.\nBasically, this is done by faith. “If we confess our sins,”  the Scripture says, “He [God]  is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness”  (1 John 1:9). We cannot do anything about the sin problem except confess, repent, and trust God for the forgiveness and cleansing that He has promised us. After that, we must not go on worrying about our sins, because if we remain conscious of sin as we pray, God will not hear our prayers. As the Scripture says, “If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear.”\nYet the psalmist went on to say, “But certainly God has heard me”\n(Psalm 66:19). In other words, the psalmist rises above Satan’s attempt to condemn him and says, “God has heard me.” Why does God hear us? Because we come in the name of Jesus. Because we come with praise and thanksgiving. Therefore, we are not condemned. ',

We have to be open and honest with Him—sincerely confessing every transgression, sinful thought, and shortcoming. But then, when all has been confessed, we need to accept complete forgiveness and complete cleansing, for we know that God will never remember our sins or hold them against us anymore. Then, we can come to Him without condemnation.\nSpeaking about prayer, Paul said in 1 Timothy 2:8, “I desire therefore that the men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.”  We must get rid of the dark inner emotions and attitudes that hinder our access to God. We must get rid of wrath and doubting.\nThe Bible says that if we doubt, we are condemned. (See Romans 14:23.) You see, we cannot come with condemnation into the presence of God.\nThe Bible says,\nHe who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind. For let not that man suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.\n(James 1:6–8)\nWe must dismiss the whole question of guilt, along with every negative or wrong attitude concerning ourselves and other people. We must come boldly. As Hebrews 4:16 says, “Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.”  Remember, it is a throne of grace that we approach, and grace is enthroned with God.

The author of Hebrews wrote, “We have confidence [“boldness” nkjv]  to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus” (Hebrews 10:19 niv).\nWhen we pray to God, we should never approach Him with condemnation. Condemnation is one of the greatest enemies to answered prayer. And the basic source of condemnation is a search for self-righteousness. If we feel that we must justify ourselves, we will never do it to our own satisfaction. There must come a time when we lay aside every attempt to justify ourselves and simply say, “I receive by faith the righteousness of Jesus Christ, imputed to me by my faith in Him, according to the Word of God. I will neither parade my good works nor blush for my bad deeds. I will come boldly because it is a throne of grace. I will not examine or analyze my own heart all the time to determine if I am good enough. I will trust God that the blood of Jesus has cleansed me from all sin. And I will come boldly to the throne, right into the Holiest of All.” That is a glorious way of access.\n“Let us draw near with a true heart,”  the Scripture says, “in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience”\n(Hebrews 10:22).

God searches every motive; He is very conscious of the reasons for which we pray. James 4:2 says,  “You do not have because you do not ask.”  The main reason that Christians do not have is a simple failure to ask. But then, James said in verse 3,  “You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your pleasures.”  In other words, self-centered prayers indicate that our motives are wrong. We are simply aiming to get some creature comfort, personal satisfaction, or indulgence.\nWhat is the correct motive? Jesus has already stated it: “That the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask anything in My name, I will do it” (John 14:13–14).\nThat is the motive behind the prayers that God answers. The prayer must be prayed sincerely so that God, in answering that prayer, may be glorified through Jesus Christ. As Paul explained in 2 Corinthians 1:20,\n“For all the promises of God in Him [Jesus Christ]  are Yes, and in Him Amen, to the glory of God through us.”\nThe whole purpose of coming to God and claiming His promises is so that God may be glorified through us in answering them. As we claim more and more of God’s promises, we glorify Him more and more. The more we fail to claim God’s promises, however, the less we glorify Him. The person who glorifies God most is the person who claims God’s promises in Christ the most.\nThe motive that is acceptable to God is one that seeks answers to prayer so that He might be glorified. These prayers must be offered in the name of His Son Jesus Christ. ',

It was a prayer of repentance after his sins—committing adultery with Bathsheba and arranging the murder of her husband, Uriah—had been uncovered.\nDavid wrote, “Have mercy upon me, O God, according to Your lovingkindness; according to the multitude of Your tender mercies, blot out my transgressions” (Psalm 51:1).\n“According to Your lovingkindness”  is another way of saying “Your covenant-keeping faithfulness.” David was saying, in effect, “You have committed Yourself to forgive me if I meet the necessary conditions, and I appeal to You on that basis.” How important it is to approach God on that basis.\nPsalm 106:1 says, “Praise the Lord! Oh, give thanks to the Lord, for He is good! For His mercy [lovingkindness, faithfulness to His covenant]\nendures forever.”  Mercy is an aspect of God’s eternal nature. Hebrews 4:16 says, “Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.”\nFirst, we need mercy, but we also need grace. What does the Bible say about grace? Grace cannot be earned. If you can earn it, it is not grace. Religious people often think that they have to earn everything.\nConsequently, they tend to turn down the grace of God. As Paul wrote,\n“If by grace, then it is no longer of works….But if it is of works, it is no longer grace”  (Romans 11:6). Two things are mentioned in Hebrews 4:16\nthat we cannot earn. We cannot earn mercy, and we cannot earn grace.\nWe need mercy for the past and grace for the future.

Rather, it is God’s righteousness and God’s faithfulness.\nThe first epistle of John expresses this thought: “Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence toward God. And whatever we ask we receive from Him”  (1 John 3:21–22).\nAny attitude that thinks we have some kind of righteousness or claim in ourselves to approach God results in our approaching Him without full confidence because there is ultimately nothing in ourselves.\nWe have no righteousness of our own. Our confidence cannot be based in ourselves.\nWe must also come to the place where we do not allow our hearts to condemn us—where we are trusting not in our own righteousness or our own wisdom but in God’s faithfulness. And that produces confidence. Paul said, “There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus” (Romans 8:1). In the remainder of that chapter, Paul painted the most glorious picture of a life that is filled and controlled by the Holy Spirit, enumerating all the blessings, privileges, and benefits of that life. But the entry into that chapter—and into that kind of life—is presented in that first verse above. We must lay aside all condemnation.\nOne requirement for a right approach to God is coming in the name of Jesus. When we come in Jesus’ name, we have assurance that our prayers are heard because of Him. It takes our attention off our own lives and works. When we come in the name of Jesus, we believe that our sins have been forgiven and that we are accepted by God as His children. This pleases God. It is how He wants us to come. ',

To remain static in the mature spiritual life is almost impossible. As Proverbs 4:18 says, “The path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, that shines brighter and brighter until the full day” (nasb). The phrase “the path of the righteous”\nis not speaking about a specific believer or group of believers but about each and every righteous person.\nNotice that righteousness is a path. It is not designed for standing still, much less for sitting down. As a path, righteousness implies motion, progress, and development. This path is like the light of dawn when we first come to know the Lord in His glorious fullness as Savior and Lord. It is like the sun rising after the darkness, or like a dawn that comes to our hearts. But dawn is not the end of God’s purposes; it is just the beginning.\nWhen we are walking in the path of righteousness, the light should always be getting brighter. With every step, with each new day, the light should be brighter than it was before. “Until the full day”: that is our destination, the height of noonday.\nGod is not content for us to stop at anything less than the full brightness of the noonday sun. Dawn is our beginning point, the path is the way of progress, and the light gets brighter and brighter. But there is no stopping permitted until we reach the full day. ',

    "body": 'This particular “Let us” is very appropriate to the New Testament Hebrew people because they had failed to live in accordance with it. They had trusted their special privileges and rested in them. They had become, quite frankly, lazy; they simply took things for granted.\nWe have much to say about this, but it is hard to explain because you are slow to learn. In fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God’s word all over again. You need milk, not solid food! Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness. But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil.\n(Hebrews 5:11–14 niv)\nWhat the writer was saying there—bluntly—is that the Hebrews were mere spiritual infants. They had no right to be infants at that stage in their Christian progress. They had had so many opportunities over many years that by then, they should have advanced to maturity. The writer of Hebrews also explained the only way to advance to maturity.\nWe must train ourselves to distinguish good from evil. Advancing to maturity on the path of righteousness comes in practice by training ourselves constantly. It does not happen automatically; it requires discipline. That is why one of the earlier steps was “Let us be diligent.”\nWe must train ourselves to distinguish good from evil.\nMany times, even large Christian congregations are unable to distinguish what is spiritual and scriptural from that which is just a fleshly presentation with soulish appeal. The only remedy is to train ourselves by constant use and careful practice. ',

Five main ministries are mentioned in this verse: apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers. The following verses tell us their purposes: To prepare God’s people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ. (verses 12–13 niv) This passage spells out two purposes for these various ministries.\nThe first is to prepare us for works of service. We cannot automatically do the work that we are expected to do; we must be prepared, or trained.\nThese five ministries are there to train us.\nThe second purpose is to build up the body of Christ. These ministries are placed within the body of Christ in order to bring us into a unity of faith and maturity. Jesus Christ, as Head of the church, has provided these ministries, and I believe that God’s people will never attain maturity without them. Paul continued, “From him [Christ]  the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work” (verse 16 niv).\nThe ultimate goal is not a lot of separated, isolated individuals, each one doing his own thing. Rather, the goal is a single body, held together by ligaments—strong bands that hold the various parts together, building up the body so that it can grow. It is essential that each part of the body does its work. ',

First, we must come under the discipline of the God-given ministries Paul listed in Ephesians 4:11: apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers. Without their discipline, oversight, and instruction, I do not see how God’s people can ever attain to maturity.\nJesus Christ never made a provision that was not important, and this one is no exception. I believe it is essential. The second condition is that we must not remain isolated individuals; rather, we must be part of a growing body of believers.\nThen, in that same passage, Paul stated a sobering alternative. If we do not follow God’s program for maturity, this will be the consequence:\n“Then we will…be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming” (Ephesians 4:14 niv).\nIf we do not come under this fivefold ministry—if we do not become part of a body and accept this scriptural discipline—then, according to Paul, we will remain infants. We will be “tossed back and forth…, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming.”  I know many, many believers who match this description. Every year, they have a new fad, a new doctrine, and often a new teacher to provide and perpetuate the fad. We must come under the discipline of godly, Scripture-based ministries. We also must be part of a body of believers. That is the only way to maturity.\nHow about you? Are you under discipline? Are you part of a body?\nAre you advancing to maturity? ',

He Himself is the new and living way by which we go on to perfection, enter the holiest, and draw near to God. (See Hebrews 6:1; 10:19–22.) The way that led Jesus to perfection is the same way that each of us must follow.\nThe path to maturity was no easier for Jesus than it is for us. He\n“was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin”  (Hebrews 4:15).\nIn His human nature, Jesus experienced every form of temptation we experience, and yet He never sinned. It is no sin to be tempted! Sin comes only when we yield to temptation.\nWhat was it that enabled Jesus, in spite of His true humanity, to overcome all temptation? His success lay in His single-hearted, unchanging motivation to do the Father’s will. This fact was prophetically foreshown by David in Psalm 40:7–8: “Then I said,\n‘Behold, I come; in the scroll of the book it is written of me. I delight to do Your will, O my God.’”\nDuring His earthly ministry, Jesus repeatedly disclosed this underlying motive for all He did. He could never know final satisfaction until He had finished every task His Father had assigned. Near Jacob’s well, He told His disciples, “My food [that which upholds and strengthens Me] is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to finish His work”  (John 4:34). (See also John 5:30; 6:38.) ',

    "body": 'The distinctive function of an Old Testament priest was to offer sacrifice. Thus, being a priest, Jesus had to offer sacrifice. Since He was not a Levite, He could not offer the sacrifices of the law, so He offered His own specific priestly sacrifice, which was prayer.\nHe had offered up prayers and supplications, with vehement cries and tears to Him [God the Father]  who was able to save Him from death, and was heard because of His godly fear, though He was a Son, yet He learned obedience by the things which He suffered.\n(Hebrews 5:7–8)\nJesus’ reverent obedience caused the Father to hear His prayers. He learned obedience through suffering. Jesus had to learn obedience, and we have to learn obedience in the same way. We find out what obedience is by obeying. We do not find it out by listening to sermons on obedience.\nThose may help us, but obedience has to be worked out, step-by-step, by obeying. Obedience brings suffering because it demands denial of one’s self-will. The key phrase in the obedience of Jesus was,  “Not My will, but Yours, be done”  (Luke 22:42). Every step of obedience in the Christian life is one of self-denial. Jesus said, “If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself”  (Matthew 16:24). That is painful, for the old ego does not like to be denied. Ego says, “I want,” “I’m important,” “This suits me,” “I feel good,” “I don’t want,” and the like. Following the Lord requires a continual denial of that ego.\nIn the above passage from Hebrews, God was talking to us about coming into maturity as sons through obedience. Jesus is the pattern.\nGod brought Him to maturity through obedience. This is the pathway for you and me, too. This is the new and living way. ',

Unfortunately, as I previously noted, the word perfection has an unattractive sound for most Christians because of some doctrine of sinless perfection that they’ve been exposed to. In most cases, those who claim to have achieved perfection demonstrate just the opposite by their words, behavior, and lifestyles. This hypocritical attitude has turned people away from the pursuit of perfection.\nI would like to remind you of three alternative translations of the word perfection that make better sense: “maturity,” “fulfillment,” and\n“completion.” The Greek word translated “perfection”  comes from a noun that means “end.” Therefore, it suggests a goal or objective toward which we are moving. I think we would all agree that having a spiritual objective is desirable. Having entered into the way of righteousness by faith, we can go on, or we can go back. God will have no pleasure in anyone who turns back, so we belong to those who are moving on into the full salvation of their souls. (See Hebrews 10:38–39.) There are two things: the actual and the ideal. To be mature is to see the ideal and live with the actual. To fail is to accept the actual and reject the ideal; and to accept only that which is ideal and refuse the actual is to be immature. Do not criticize the actual because you have seen the ideal; Do not reject the ideal because you see the actual.\nMaturity is to live with the actual but hold on to the ideal. ',

This one says, in essence,  “Let us draw near to God.”  We need to understand it in its context. It is directly related to the statement in Hebrews 10:\nSince we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place…, let us draw near to God.\n(Hebrews 10:19, 22 niv)\nTo me, this passage clearly says that “drawing near to God” is equivalent to “entering the Most Holy Place.”\nLet’s compare these two statements. “Let us come boldly to the throne” means that we are to come for the help we need—for mercy and grace. But, “Let us draw near to God,” I think, takes us much further.\nThe suggestion is not merely that we come to the throne for help, but also that we are invited to take our place with Christ on the throne.\nThat is what it means to enter the Most Holy Place.\nThere is not enough space to give a detailed exposition of the tabernacle, but there were three main areas. First, there was the Outer Court. Then, beyond the first curtain of the tent was the Holy Place.\nAnd finally, beyond the second curtain was the Most Holy Place.

Its lid was called the mercy seat, or the place of propitiation. Inside were the two tablets of the Ten Commandments, but these were covered up by the mercy seat, indicating that through Christ’s propitiation on our behalf, the broken law (the Ten Commandments that were broken) has been covered by His propitiation. On either end of the mercy seat was a cherub. The two cherubs faced one another, looking toward the center of the mercy seat with their wings stretched out over them and their wing tips touching over the center of the mercy seat.The mercy seat was God’s throne—He sits on a throne of mercy that covers the broken law. The two cherubs with their faces turned inward toward one another, their wing tips touching, represent the place of fellowship. So, this is a place of mercy and a place of fellowship—but it is also a throne, the seat of God as King.\nIn that piece of furniture there was no representation of God Himself, which was forbidden for the Israelites. But God did come in and take His place on that seat in the form of the shekinah  glory—the visible, sensory presence of almighty God.

First, one must have a “sincere heart” ; second, one must have a “ full assurance of faith” ; third, one’s heart must be “sprinkled to cleanse [him] from a guilty conscience” ; and, fourth, one’s body must be\n“washed with pure water” (niv). Let’s look very briefly at each of these.\nA sincere heart: We approach God with our hearts, not with our heads. God is not the answer to an intellectual riddle, but He will meet a sincere, longing heart. We must come without pretense, exposing ourselves to God just as we are without hiding anything.\nFull assurance of faith: Hebrews 11:6 says, “But without faith it is impossible to please Him [God],  for he who comes to God must believe.”\nWe must come with absolute faith in God’s faithfulness—not faith in our own abilities or righteousness.\nOur hearts sprinkled from a guilty conscience: A guilty conscience results from committing wrong, sinful deeds. But through the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus, we have assurance that our evil deeds have been forgiven and that our hearts are pure from sin.\nOur bodies washed with pure water: First John 5:6 says that Jesus came by water and by blood. In Hebrews 10:22, we see both these elements: the blood that sprinkles from an evil conscience and the water that washes our bodies. I believe that the water represents Christian baptism. In the New Testament, Christian baptism means sharing in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. So, the “new and living way”  mentioned in Hebrews 10:20 is Jesus. We are to identify with all that He endured when He died for our sins and rose again. ',

First, we are made alive; second, we are raised up, or resurrected; and, third, we are seated with Him. Jesus is seated on the throne. So, what does it mean for us to be seated with Him? It means to be enthroned, to share the throne with Him.\nOnce we understand our identification with Jesus, we are invited to follow Him all the way. He is the “new and living way” (Hebrews 10:20). We can be made alive with Him, we can be resurrected with Him. But we need not stop there.

This preview is found in the ordinance of the Day of Atonement, described in detail in Leviticus 16. The high priest was to go just once each year into the Most Holy Place, the Holy of Holies. He had to take two things: a censer filled with incense, which made an aromatic cloud that covered him and the mercy seat, and the blood of the sacrifice, offered on his own behalf.\nGoing thusly into the Most Holy Place, he had to sprinkle the blood seven times between the second veil, where he entered, and the front (or east) side of the mercy seat itself. So, there was an initial sprinkling of the blood seven times. I believe that this was an exact prophetic preview of how Jesus was to sprinkle His own blood on the way to the cross, as well as on the cross itself. The number seven indicates the work of the Holy Spirit—it is the number of completeness, or perfection, indicating a perfect work. The prophetic sprinkling was exactly fulfilled in the way that Jesus shed His blood: He shed His blood precisely seven times before the sacrifice was complete.\nIn that sevenfold shedding, Jesus’ body was emptied of blood.\nHe literally poured out His soul to death in these steps: (1) His sweat became blood (see, for example, Luke 22:44), (2) they struck Him in the face with fists and rods (see, for example, Luke 22:63–64), (3) they flogged Him with a Roman scourge (see, for example, Luke 18:33), (4) His beard was pulled out (see Isaiah 50:6), (5) thorns were pressed into His scalp (see, for example, Matthew 27:29), (6) His hands and feet were pierced with nails (see, for example, John 20:25), and (7) His side was pierced with a spear (see John 19:34).

The Lord said, “For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood that makes atonement for the soul” (Leviticus 17:11).\nThat is a tremendous prophetic statement that was fulfilled fourteen centuries later in Jesus. The word that is translated life  is the Hebrew word for soul ( nephesh). It is not just the life of a human being that is in the blood, but it is also the soul. We all know that when the blood ceases to circulate, the life has gone. In a certain sense, life depends on the blood.\nIn the previous chapter of Leviticus, in the ordinances for the Day of Atonement, Moses told his brother, Aaron, the high priest, that he could go only once every year into the Most Holy Place, into the immediate presence of God. He had to enter holding in one hand a censer full of burning coals with incense on them to send up a cloud of fragrant smoke; in the other hand he had to hold the blood of the sin offering that had been slain in front of the tabernacle. If he did not have both the censer of fragrant incense and the blood of the sacrificial animal, death would be the consequence. There was no access to the presence of God without those two things.\nThe censer, with its fragrant incense, is a beautiful type that symbolizes worship. We never come into the immediate presence of God without worship. But we never come without blood, either, which speaks of atonement for our sins. These pictures in the Old Testament were prophetic types—previews of what would actually be fulfilled in the New Testament. ',

The lifeblood of Jesus is the life of God the Creator—a life that is greater than the entire universe and all the creatures He ever created. That life is released only through the blood of Jesus. He became the Life-giver when He shed His blood.\nWe should never turn away from the blood of Jesus. There is no other atonement for sin, and no other source of life. One of our big problems, brothers and sisters, is not meditating enough on the blood. ',

    "body": 'Most Christians have heard much preaching about faith and love, but, in many cases, they have heard comparatively little about hope. Such was my own condition many years ago when I was in desperate need of help from God. I had heard many messages on faith and some preaching on love; but what I needed in that particular situation was hope, and the Holy Spirit had to take me directly to the Scripture because I had never heard a sermon about hope. It was there that the Holy Spirit met my need. For this reason, I am particularly concerned that people understand the importance of hope. I want you to grasp what hope is, how important it is, and how you may have it.\nHope is necessary if we are to maintain both faith and love. Unless we have hope, our faith will “leak out” and our love will fail. Hope is not optional; it is essential to the fullness of the Christian life.\nPeople often say, “Where there’s life, there’s hope.” I think there is a good deal of truth in that statement. But the opposite is also true: Where there’s hope, there’s life—and where there is no hope, there is no life. In my opinion, hopelessness is one of the saddest conditions in human experience. I can hardly think of anything sadder than being hopeless. Yet, countless people in our world today are completely hopeless. When I am sitting in an airport, taking a walk, or dining in a restaurant, and I look at the faces of other people, I find that many of them have a blank stare of hopelessness. But, thank God, we do not need to be hopeless. ',

We must make the words of our mouths agree with what the Word of God says. In Hebrews 10:23, the step that we are now considering, it says, “Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering.”\nNotice what has been added: “without wavering.”\nIf we look through these passages of Hebrews in the order in which they appear, we find that, in respect to our confession, there are three successive stages. First, we make the confession; second, having made it, we hold it fast without changing it; and, third, we hold it fast without wavering.\nWhy was “without wavering”  put in? To me, on the basis of logic and personal experience, it implies that when we make the right confession, we are going to encounter negative forces and pressures that will come against us. Even though we have made the right confession and we are holding it fast, there may come a time when it seems like all the forces of Satan and the powers of darkness are turned loose against us. The temptation is to let go of our confession. But the writer said,\n“Don’t let go! Hold fast—without wavering.” The darker the situation and the greater the problem, the more important it is to hold fast without wavering.\nGod is faithful. He is committed to His Word. Jesus is our High Priest. If we will only hold fast our confession without wavering, He will do His job as our High Priest. ',

    "body": 'There is a disconnect between faith and sight. The natural man walks by sight, trusting his senses and believing only what they tell him. But in the Christian life, the spiritual life, we should not trust our senses. Second Corinthians 5:7 tells us, “For we walk by faith, not by sight.”  We walk not by our senses, but by faith. Faith relates us to an unseen, eternal realm that never changes. The world of the senses is always changing—it is temporary, unstable, impermanent, and unreliable. Through faith, we relate to a different world—a world of eternal realities and eternal truths. As we relate to that world by faith, we hold fast our confession without wavering.\nHow we respond to the pressures God permits in our lives determines whether we trust our senses or our faith. If we change our confession because of the darkness, then we are going by our senses, for in faith there is no darkness. Faith does not rely on the senses; it sees with an inner spiritual eye into a realm that does not change and it trusts a High Priest who is unchangeable. Here is what James said about this issue:\nBut when he [the believer]  asks, he must believe and not doubt, because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind. That man should not think he will receive anything from the Lord; he is a double-minded man, unstable in all he does.\n(James 1:6–8 niv)\nThis passage describes the man who wavers. He started out ready to ask—believing, not doubting—but he did not hold fast without wavering. As a result, he is tossed to and fro, thrown about by the winds and waves. The remedy is to hold fast our confession without wavering. ',

Abraham is one of the best examples of someone who held fast without wavering. As Paul wrote, Without weakening in his faith, he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead—since he was about a hundred years old—\nand that Sarah’s womb was also dead.\n(Romans 4:19 niv)\nReal faith faces facts. Any attitude that is not willing to look at the facts is not real faith. Abraham did not try to deceive himself; he did not imagine something differently from how it was. With his senses, he saw that his body was as good as dead, as was the womb of his wife, Sarah.\nBut he did not trust solely in his senses. Paul continued, Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God, being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised. This is why “it was credited to him as righteousness.”\n(Romans 4:20–22 niv)\nAbraham is called  “the father of all those who believe”  (Romans 4:11), and we are exhorted to follow in the steps of Abraham’s faith.\n(See verse 12.) We are required to walk that same path of faith. We are required to lay hold of the promise of God, to make our confession, to hold fast our confession without wavering, to refuse to be deterred by what our senses reveal, and to look beyond the seen things, peering into the unseen realm to see, by faith, our faithful High Priest, there at God’s right hand.

If you have a problem in your kidneys, then you would confess, “Jesus Himself [remember, the emphasis is on Him] took my infirmities and bore my sicknesses; with His wounds, I am healed.” Afterward, if you still have the problem in your kidneys, what do you do? Hold fast your confession. Do you still have the problem in your kidneys? Hold fast your confession without wavering. This is a battle. Believe me, I know from experience that pressing your way into healing can be a tremendous battle.\nThe writer of Hebrews said to the Hebrew Christians, “You have not yet resisted to bloodshed, striving against sin”  (Hebrews 12:4). We are used to the idea that we have to strive against sin, but we sometimes forget that we have to strive against sickness, too. We must fight. We are soldiers. We do not lie down and let the devil walk over us, for easy surrender does not give glory to God.\nIn regard to holding fast our confession without wavering, let us not focus exclusively on physical healing, even though the need for it is something that touches almost all people. What about financial needs?\nFor me—and this is not just a ritual—holding fast my confession is my way to release the treasures that God has in His storehouse for my ministry. God spoke to me and told me that He had made full provision for everything He would ask us to do. But to obtain the full provision, we had to believe and confess. And I make it personal. This confession is taken from 2 Corinthians 9:8: “God is able to make all grace abound toward [us],  that [we],  always having all sufficiency in all things, may have an abundance for every good work.”  Glory to God!

    "body": 'We must emphasize the vital importance of faith. I say to you what Jesus said to Peter: “I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail” (Luke 22:32). Faith is the basic requirement for belonging to God and being a child of Abraham, who is “the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of the faith which our father Abraham had while still uncircumcised”\n(Romans 4:12). Abraham is more than just a figure—he is a pattern.\nHe went ahead, laid out the pathway, and took certain steps. To be truly his descendants, we must walk in that pathway and follow in his steps. Let’s look at the five steps of the faith of Abraham: (1) he accepted God’s promise by faith alone, without evidence; (2) he recognized that he was incapable of producing the results on his own; (3) he focused on the promise without wavering, and this faith was reckoned to him as righteousness; (4) as a result, Sarah and he both received supernatural life in their bodies; and (5) thus, the promise was fulfilled, and God was glorified.\nThose are the steps of the faith of our father Abraham—the pathway of faith that is set before every one of us. It is not some external ordinance but a lifetime walk of faith, following in the footsteps of Abraham. We must do as Abraham did. We have to accept God’s promise just the way it is. We have to reckon that we are incapable of producing what God has promised in our lives. We have to focus on the promise and not on our own ability—or inability. And then, we will receive the supernatural grace and power of God released in our lives through our faith. In this way, the promise of God will be fulfilled in our lives. ',

Here, we see a relationship between faith and hope. Faith is here and now; hope is for the future. Faith is a material thing—something so real that it is called a substance.  It is in our hearts. On the basis of faith, we can have a legitimate hope for the future. But hope that is not based on legitimate faith is just wishful thinking.\nIf you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes unto…salvation.\n(Romans 10:9–10)\nIn the New Testament,  believe  is a word of motion. It is not a static thing or an intellectual position. It is something in your heart that leads you to something new. Faith  is a verb of motion: by faith we believe unto righteousness and salvation. You can have intellectual faith and never be changed. You can embrace all the doctrines of the Bible with your intellect but remain completely the same. But when you have faith in your heart, it leads to salvation.\nFaith is in the present; hope is in the future. Biblical faith is in the heart; hope is in the mind. Paul spoke about both with an interesting picture: “But let us who are of the day be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet the hope of salvation” (1 Thessalonians 5:8). Two items of armor are mentioned in this verse. Faith is a breastplate, which protects the heart, and hope is the helmet, which protects the head. Faith is in the heart; hope is in the mind. ',

Some English translations say, “Let us consider how to stimulate one another.”  But the order is reversed from the original Greek, which reads, “Let us consider one another, how to stimulate to love and good deeds.” This rendering brings out the essence of this week’s resolution to consider others. We should consider one another, always seeking to bring out the best in each other.\nMany people today are shut up in prisons of self-centeredness. They are never truly happy; they never enjoy true peace. In fact, the more you worry and seek to please yourself, the more problems you have.\nOne scriptural way to be released from that prison is to stop worrying about yourself all the time. Stop being concerned about yourself and start considering your fellow believers.\nWe are to follow Jesus’ example and live out Paul’s exhortation: Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind let each of you regard one another as more important than himself; do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others.\n(Philippians 2:3–7 nasb)\nThe opposite of considering one another is looking out for  “your own personal interests.”  Release comes through being more concerned about others than you are about yourself.

The Greek word translated “bond-servant”  literally means “slave.” So, we see that Jesus, who was Lord of all, emptied Himself and was willing to become a bondservant, a slave. We must imitate His attitude.\nPaul penned a beautiful, parallel passage in Galatians:\n<i>For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh [do not gratify your own fleshly, selfish desires] , but through love serve one another.\nFor the whole Law is fulfilled in one word, in the statement, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”</i> (Galatians 5:13–14 nasb)\nLooking outward at others is the way in which we free ourselves from indulging in our fleshly natures or yielding to selfishness. We are to serve one another in love. I believe that the Holy Spirit is emphasizing this loving, selfless attitude to God’s people today. Many people talk about serving the Lord but never serve their fellow believers. I do not know how much you can really serve the Lord if you are not willing to serve your fellow believers, because the Lord comes to us in the members of His body.

His was the kind of righteousness that caused him to separate himself from other people, whom he regarded on a lower level or even despised.\nBut when he came to know Jesus, the most wonderful change took place in his nature. Bear in mind that the people of Corinth were basically the scum of the earth. In this epistle, Paul said that some of them had been homosexuals, some prostitutes, some drunkards, and some revilers. They were just not the best kind of people. Corinth was one of the major seaports of the ancient world, and, like many seaports, the city was filled with these sorts of people.\nBut let’s look at this astonishing statement of Paul: <i>“For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your bondservants for Jesus’ sake”</i> (2 Corinthians 4:5 nasb).\nHere is this proud Pharisee saying, “We are your slaves for the sake of Jesus”—even to the likes of the people of Corinth!\nNotice the three steps. First, dethrone self:  <i>“not...ourselves.”</i> Second, enthrone Christ: <i>“Christ Jesus as Lord.”</i>  Third, serve others:“[we are]  <i>your bond-servants for Jesus’ sake.”</i>  Those three steps are so important.

I have a friend who used to be a server, and he once explained to me all that is involved in being a <i>good</i> server.\nOnce I understood the training process, I realised that it does not just happen; serving is a skill we have to acquire. We have to study others to find out what produces a positive response, not a negative one. We are to study others to provoke them to love and good deeds, not to the opposite. Serving requires practice, training, and discipline. \nServing also requires the right environment. After saying, <i>“Let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds”</i> (Hebrews 10:24 nasb), the writer of Hebrews went on to say, <i>“Not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more, as you see the day drawing near”</i> (verse 25 nasb). We must learn to serve in the right environment, which is expressed in the words <i>“our own assembling together.”</i>  It means close, committed, regular fellowship.\n In the next verse, the writer presented the disastrous alternative. Immediately after he warned us not to forsake our own assembling together, he said, <i>“For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a certain terrifying expectation of judgment”</i> (verses 26–27 nasb).

We consider Jesus first; then, we consider one another. It makes a great deal of difference whether I relate to you as just a person or as a person in Christ.\nMy mind goes back to an incident that happened while I was the principal of a college that trained teachers in East Africa. For every vacancy that allowed us to accept one student, there were at least ten suitable applicants. One girl actually walked twenty-four miles barefoot just to get an interview. You can hardly conceive the desperate hunger people in Africa had for getting an education. Education was the key to success in life, as they saw it.\nOne day, an elderly mother came to me on behalf of her son, a prospective student. He was not exactly suitable for the school, however, and we had not accepted him. His mother was pestering me to the point that I was growing annoyed with her. In Africa, they do not believe in democracy; they believe in the chief, the strong man. He is the one who matters. This woman kept telling me, “You are the great one; what you say goes.” I got so irritated that I was about to give her a piece of my mind—and it was not my sanctified mind, either! That is when the Lord spoke to me, very gently, saying, "Remember, she’s one of My children. Be careful how you treat her." I repented. She really was a dear, precious woman, and a child of God.

Do you know what a paroxysm is? It is an absolutely uncontrollable outburst of emotion, such as anger, or even laughter.\nAlthough the word <i>provoke</i>  often suggests something bad, in this context, it is turned to the good, for we are to provoke one another to love and good works. And let me just point out that there are certain people whom you’ll <i>have</i>  to provoke if you want them to do the right thing. Moreover, you will have to consider <i>how</i> to provoke them.\nThis is one of my weaknesses. I don’t like having to consider people’s personalities. With a military background and a rather logical mind, it is sufficient for me just to tell the person to do something. But the Bible tells us to consider <i>how</i> to tell them, because if you want the right result from one person, you have to tell him in quite a different way from the way in which you might tell another person. Anybody who has children knows this is true—you cannot treat them all the same. You can scold one child and get the right result. But if you scold another child, you might just discourage or defeat him.',

We may find ourselves side-by-side with unbelievers every day—in our homes, in our workplaces, or in other activities of daily life. In such situations, our Christian testimony requires us to be friendly, courteous, and helpful. But we are not free to share with unbelievers that which is morally or spiritually impure or dishonoring to Christ. In this realm, we must follow Paul’s exhortation in 2 Corinthians 6:17: <i>“Do not touch what is unclean.”</i>  If we are sensitive to the Holy Spirit, He will always warn us of these defiling contacts and show us how to protect ourselves from them.\nHowever, the surest protection against wrong fellowship is right fellowship. As God’s children, we are heirs to innumerable joys and blessings of which the world knows nothing. In fact, Paul told us that our Father God <i>“has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ”</i> (Ephesians 1:3).

But it just so happens that, in the original Greek, the first phrase, <i>“let us...lay aside every encumbrance,”</i>  is not found in that form. Instead, it is a participle that reads like this: “Laying aside every encumbrance, let us run with endurance the race.” The real “let us” phrase in the above verse, on which we will need to focus, is <i>“Let us run with endurance the race that is set before us.”</i>\nHere and elsewhere in the New Testament, the Christian life is compared to a race. This analogy implies a specific course marked out before us in advance. Success in the Christian life consists in completing the course in accordance with the rules of the competition.\nIn light of the fact that we are confronted with this race that is set before us, we need to see that there are four requirements for successfully completing the race. Each one of these requirements is found in the New Testament: (1) the right mental attitude, (2) self-control, (3) endurance, and (4) having our eyes fixed on Jesus.

This truth was exemplified by the words of Paul as he spoke about his relationship to Jesus Christ: <i>“That I may know Him, and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death; in order that I may attain to the resurrection from the dead”</i> (Philippians 3:10–11 nasb).\nPaul had a specific objective. He did not run aimlessly. (See 1 Corinthians 9:26.) He had an aim before him. He knew what the goal was, which determined his mental attitude. He continued, <i>“Not that I have already obtained it, or have already become perfect</i> [complete], <i>but I press on in order that I may lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus”</i> (verse 12 nasb). Paul’s vision was that Christ had laid hold of him for a purpose; fulfilling that purpose meant that he would have to relate to this purpose. He had to be determined that the purpose of Christ would become his purpose.\n<i>Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.</i> (verses 13–14 nasb)\nThe phrase <i>“I press on”</i>  occurs twice, once in verse 12 and once in verse 14. That is the mental attitude we need to share with Paul: <i>“I press on. I have a goal. I have not yet arrived, but I know where I’m headed.”</i>\nThe last time Paul used that phrase, he said, “I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.”  There is a reward for those who successfully complete the race. Always keep the goal in mind, for we do not want to lose our God-appointed reward.',

The same principle still applies.<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but only one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may win.</i> (1 Corinthians 9:24 nasb)</p>That is the objective.

This truth is so obvious when we think in terms of athletics. Every athlete who succeeds as an athlete today has to exercise the most rigorous self-control. He has to go into training—controlling what he eats, how much sleep he gets, and the amount of exercise he has. He also has to control his psychology, building up the right kind of attitude. He cannot afford to give way to negative thoughts. He has to go into the competition with a positive attitude, believing he is going to achieve victory.\nAll this is equally true for us as Christians in our race.

We must cultivate endurance.\nWhat is the opposite of endurance? I think it is giving up, or quitting. Christians cannot afford to be quitters. When God commits us to something, we have to set our faces to fulfill it and go through with it. There is a close relationship between self-control and endurance.\nWithout self-control, we will not achieve endurance. We must master our weaknesses; otherwise, every time we are tested in the area of endurance, some weakness—whether it is emotional, psychological, or physical—will get us down, and we will give up at the very point where we should have been holding on and enduring.\nYet another condition for a successful race is to have our eyes fixed on Jesus. As is stated in Hebrews, <i>“Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross”</i> (Hebrews 12:2 nasb).\nWe have to look continually to Jesus. In other words, we cannot run the race in self-reliance. Looking to Jesus means that He is our example, and we put our confidence in Him. He is the author - the beginning of our faith.

Remember, this is not a short sprint - it is a long, deliberate race.\nThe primary characteristic that is required is endurance. Many people start off the Christian life as if it were a dash. A little while later, they are panting beside the track; they are finished, and they have hardly begun the race. Ecclesiastes 9:11 wisely points out, <i>“The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong.”</i>\nThe following is the testimony of a victor - the apostle Paul:<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith; in the future there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day; and not only to me, but also to all who have loved His appearing.

Paul went on to say that we rejoice not only in the light of the future, but also in what the present offers: <i>“And not only in that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope”</i> (verses 3–4). Where verse 3 uses the word <i>“glory,”</i>  the original Greek word means “to rejoice, boast, or exult.” We should exult in tribulation because of what tribulation does. The <i>New American Standard Bible</i> says, <i>“Tribulation brings about perseverance; and perseverance, proven character; and proven character, hope.”</i>  Perseverance produces  <i>proven</i>  character in us. This is the heart of endurance—character that has stood the test. As Paul wrote, <i>“Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us”</i> (Romans 5:5).\nLove is a matter of character. In essence, we are dealing with the formation of our characters. We rejoice in tribulation, for tribulation is the only thing that produces perseverance. And perseverance produces proven character. I know men with whom I have walked and shared hardship, opposition, misrepresentation, and misunderstanding. But today, for me, their character is proven; I know I can trust them.

You will get immediate assurance that He is going to continue to be faithful. Just as He has helped and guided you in the past, He will guide you in the future. But the key to this assurance is acknowledging Him by our thanksgiving.\nWhen I was in East Africa, I discovered that in the language of my adopted African daughter’s tribe, they had no word or phrase that meant “thank you.” Can you imagine not being able to say “thank you”?\nI then realised that it is only where the Bible has come that people have learned to say “thank you.” It is part of the grace of God.',

For if those did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, much less shall we [believers in the New Testament]  escape who turn away from Him who warns from heaven.

That is why the writer of Hebrews said,<i>“Let us show gratitude, by which we may offer to God an acceptable service with reverence and awe”</i>  (Hebrews 12:28 nasb). Without gratitude, our services to God will not be acceptable. It is that “attitude of gratitude” that makes our services acceptable and releases our spirits.An unthankful person is bound up in himself. He is self-centered.He really cannot know true liberation.

Now, look at the disintegration of character, morality, and standards. Paul said,<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God—having a form of godliness but denying its power.

I would predict that, if you go over that list again, you will find that most of these character defects are already conspicuous in our contemporary culture. And, right there in the middle of the list, it says that people are <i>“disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love.”</i> Notice the association. The ungrateful are right next door to the unholy. You cannot be holy and remain ungrateful. Since our God is a consuming fire (see, for example, Hebrews 12:29), He requires that we serve Him with holiness, which is appropriate. We also have to serve Him with gratitude. We must come to Him with thankfulness. Let us show gratitude so that we may serve Him acceptably, with reverence and godly fear. (See verse 28.)',

Thankfulness, like most important attitudes of the Christian life, originates in the will, not in the emotions. We do not have to feel thankful in order to be thankful. Those who have children train them to say “thank you.” In Britain, children are expected to say “thank you” even before they receive anything. It is simply a matter of proper conduct.\nGod often deals with us in that way, requiring us to say “thank you” before we actually receive something. Oftentimes, if we wait to receive it first, we will not get it.<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.</i> (Colossians 3:15–17)</p>This passage makes two demands of us: to do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus, and to give thanks while doing them. These instructions apply to every task, whether it’s scrubbing the kitchen floor, cleaning the bathroom, driving the car, or writing a letter.\nThat gives us a pretty good gauge of right and wrong. If there is anything that we cannot honestly do in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks all the while, then we’d better not do it. This method cuts away a whole list of do’s and don’ts.

Giving thanks is a principle that should guide all that we do.

Concerning the giving thanks in everything, Paul said, “This is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.” When we are not giving thanks, we are not fulfilling the will of God. In other words, we are out of God’s will. How important it is to understand that!\nThe second thing I want to say about thankfulness, or thanksgiving, is that it is an essential expression of the fullness of the Spirit. Paul wrote, “Do not quench the Spirit”  (verse 19). Here is what he said to the Ephesians: <i>“So then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled with the [Holy]  Spirit”</i>  (Ephesians 5:17–18 nasb).\nPaul provided us with a negative, followed by a positive, regarding the will of the Lord. If we do not understand these truths about God’s will, then we are foolish. Each exhortation is equally valid. It is wrong for a Christian to get drunk with wine, but it is equally wrong for a Christian not to be filled with the Holy Spirit. Sometimes, as religious people, we focus so much on the negative—not filling ourselves with wine so that we become drunk—that we forget about the positive—being filled with the Holy Spirit. We need to be filled with the Spirit.',

For here we do not have a lasting city, but we are seeking the city which is to come.</i> (Hebrews 13:12–14 nasb)</p>This passage deals with our attitude and relationship to this present world. It is telling us that our home is not in this world. We have no enduring place in this world. The world rejected Jesus. It drove Him out of the city and crucified Him outside the gate.\nThe Scripture always emphasizes the fact that Jesus’ crucifixion took place outside the city wall. Jesus was rejected. He was put out of society; the world did not want Him. And the way in which the world treated Jesus, sooner or later, and in one way or another, is going to be the way in which the world will treat you and me, as believers. We must be willing to go out to Him—to the place of crucifixion, rejection, and shame—bearing His reproach. Elsewhere in Hebrews, it says that the reproach of Christ amounts to greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt. (See <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/114/HEB.11.NKJV?parallel=151">Hebrews 11:26</a>.) So, His reproach becomes our glory.\nThen, the writer gave a beautiful reason:  <i>“For here we do not have a lasting city.”</i>  Other people may think that this world is permanent, but we know that it is not. “But we are seeking the city which is to come.” I like this translation because it says the city.

Even in the church, many people profess allegiance to Christ but reject His cross. Their end is destruction.\nBy our identification with the cross of Jesus, we also rule out pleasing this world. James wrote these stern words to professing believers: <i>“You adulterous people, don’t you know that friendship with the world is hatred toward God? Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God”</i> (James 4:4 niv). James called these people <i>“adulterous.”</i>  Becoming part of the bride of Christ, the church, requires a spiritual commitment—the bride must be single-hearted, totally committed and devoted to Jesus. If that devotion to Jesus is infiltrated by the love of this world, then we are spiritual adulterers. We are not being faithful to the Bridegroom, Jesus Christ.

Not in education, religion, or denomination—none of these things. We can safely boast only in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ, where Jesus won a total, permanent, irreversible victory over all the forces of evil. Through the cross, <i>“the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.”</i>  The cross is the mark of separation between the people of God and the world.

It was led off into an uninhabited land to wander there hopelessly and die of thirst. It never returned.\nJesus was the scapegoat in the figure of the Day of Atonement. He was banished from the presence of Almighty God. Jesus is actually typified by both goats. As the sin offering, He died on the cross. But as the scapegoat, He was banished from the presence of God, enduring our rejection for us. The opposite of banishment is acceptance. That is stated in Ephesians 1:6:  <i>“He made us accepted in the Beloved.”</i>\nWe must all understand that we are accepted. Again, one of the most common problems that people have in modern America is the feeling of rejection. In any given congregation, I can guarantee that there are several people who are struggling with feelings of rejection. In most cases, these feelings are due to their parents—growing up, they may have never believed that their parents really wanted them, and so they never learned to feel accepted. They go through life feeling rejected, unhappy, unable to integrate with other people, and unable to show love, because they have never experienced love.\nI have learned by experience that one of the great keys to helping such people is to impart to them the assurance that they are accepted by God.

To me, this resolution is very appropriate and beautiful because it is something we are instructed to keep on doing. If we continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, all year long, it will make all the difference as to what the year holds for each of us.\nThis final step of offering up a sacrifice of praise to God relates directly, and in a practical way, to the two previous steps, which were, “Let us show gratitude” and “Let us go forth to Him outside the gate.”\nGratitude naturally leads to praise. There are many passages in the Bible in which thanksgiving is related to praise. One of the most beautiful is Psalm 100:4: <i>“Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts with praise.”</i> The first step in gaining access to God is thanksgiving; the second step is praise. Thanksgiving leads to praise. It finds expression in praise, and it flows out in praise.\nThe step just before this one, “Let us go forth to Him outside the camp,” brings us release from the two slaveries of pleasing self and pleasing the world. Again, this step is directly related to offering the sacrifice of praise. You might not see it at first, but there are two hindrances to spontaneous, free-flowing praise in our lives: love of self and love of the world.

According to the principles of Scripture, a sacrifice requires a death. In the Old Testament sacrifices, nothing was ever offered to God that had not passed through death. So, we see that the sacrifice of praise requires a death—the death of the old man. The old man cannot praise God as He deserves to be praised. There has to be a death.\nAgain, we know that a sacrifice costs us something; thus, praise is costly. Let me put it this way: we need to praise God most when we least feel like it.

    "body": 'Let’s look at the example of King David in Psalm 34. The introduction to this psalm says, “A psalm of David when he feigned madness before Abimelech [or Achish],  who drove him away and he departed” (nasb).\nAt this time in his life, David was a fugitive from his own country.\nKing Saul was trying to kill him, so David had to leave his familiar surroundings.\nHe went to the court of a Gentile king for refuge, but the king suspected him of being an enemy. In order to save his own life, he had to feign madness. The historic book of 1 Samuel tells us that he scratched at the door and slobbered on his beard. (See 1 Samuel 21:10–15.) That was the situation. But what was David’s reaction?\nI will bless the Lord at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth. My soul shall make its boast in the Lord; the humble shall hear it and rejoice. O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt His name together.\n(Psalm 34:1–3 nasb)\nRight there, in the midst of such a terrible situation, with his life hanging in the balance and the shame of having to feign madness, David praised the Lord. That is the sacrifice of praise. When he was at his lowest, David decided to go on boasting in the Lord. When there was nothing else to boast about, he decided to boast in the Lord.\nThen, David went on,  “O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt His name together.”  Praise is contagious. If we learn to praise God in this way, others will join in. But grumbling is contagious, too. If we grumble, we will attract fellow grumblers. We must learn to offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually. ',

    "body": 'When I was serving in the British army during World War II, I was stationed in the deserts of North Africa. One negative aspect of desert living conditions is that they tend to provoke murmuring and complaining. This happened with Israel many times, and it often brought God’s judgment and disfavor upon them. I got so weary of the desert, the food, and the blaspheming British soldiers that I began to complain. When I did this, I lost the sense of God’s presence and blessing.\nI decided to set aside a special day to fast and to ask God why His presence seemed to have withdrawn from me. I said, “God, why are You not near to me? Why do I have to continue this monotonous, wearisome life in the desert?” By evening, God had given me the answer. He spoke to me very clearly, saying, “Why have you not thanked Me? Why have you not praised Me?” As I meditated on what God said, I realised that I had lost the sense of His presence because I had become unthankful.\nIn due course, the Holy Spirit directed me to various passages along this line, including 1 Thessalonians 5:16–19: “Rejoice always; pray without ceasing; in everything give thanks; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus. Do not quench the Spirit” (nasb). Again, the implication is that if we do not rejoice always, pray without ceasing, and give thanks in everything, we are quenching the Holy Spirit! By murmuring and complaining instead of praising and giving thanks, I had quenched the Holy Spirit in my life.\nGod expects us to continually offer up a sacrifice of praise from our lips—not just inwardly from our hearts. We have to make our praise vocal by giving thanks to the name of the Lord! ',

    "body": 'As we have seen, thankfulness is a direct command of Scripture and an indispensable mark of being filled with the Holy Spirit.\nThese facts lead to two practical conclusions that apply to each of us personally: first, an unthankful Christian is disobedient; second, an unthankful Christian is not full of the Holy Spirit.\nThanksgiving is also a requirement for entering God’s presence, as we read in Psalm 100:4–5: “Enter His gates with thanksgiving, and His courts with praise. Give thanks to Him; bless His name. For the Lord is good; His lovingkindness is everlasting, and His faithfulness to all generations” (nasb). Two essential stages in our approach to God are entering the gates with thanksgiving and entering the courts with praise.\nAgain, the psalmist also gave three specific reasons that we should thank God. First, “the Lord is good” ; second, “His lovingkindness is everlasting” ; and, third, “His faithfulness [is]  to all generations.”  Each of these is permanent and unchanging. God is always good; His lovingkindness is everlasting; His faithfulness is to all generations. The primary reasons for giving thanks to God never depend on our feelings or circumstances. We may feel up one day, down the next; sometimes we are encouraged, other times discouraged. But there is no reason to change our attitude of thankfulness to God.\nIn order to approach God on the basis of these three eternal facts, we need to change our focus. We need to look away from things that irritate, discourage, or provoke us, looking instead at the eternal things, which we see through eyes of faith. When we come to God with the right focus, we are in a position to hear from God and to receive from Him. ',

    "body": 'Praise is a spiritual weapon that we can use to silence the devil.\nThere is perhaps no more important fact in the Bible than this.\nFrom the point of view of practical Christian living, God has given you a way to silence the devil’s mouth. Psalm 8:2 says, “Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have ordained strength, because of Your enemies, that You may silence the enemy and the avenger.”  The psalmist, addressing God, was speaking about “enemies”  in the plural and “the enemy and the avenger”  in the singular. “The enemy and the avenger”\nis none other than the devil himself;  “enemies”  are the evil spirits that are Satan’s instruments against us. Because of Satan and his evil spirits, God has ordained strength that we might silence the devil.\nThis verse was quoted by Jesus in the gospel of Matthew. The quotation is a revelation of the full meaning of this passage. In this scene, Jesus is in the temple, healing the sick, and the children are running to and fro, crying, “Hosanna to the Son of David!” (Matthew 21:15). This upsets the religious leaders, so they say to Jesus, “Do You hear what they are saying?” Jesus then gives us this revelation: “Yes.\nHave you never read, ‘Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have perfected praise’?” (verse 16). Where the psalmist said, “You have ordained strength,”  Jesus said, “You have perfected praise.”  So, we get a simple, direct inference. The “ordained strength” of God’s people in battle is “perfected praise.” God has made it possible for us to silence the devil and all his evil spirits by perfect praise.\nAs “babes and infants,” if we will but praise God perfectly, out of our mouths will come forth a weapon that silences the devil. And God will be glorified. ',

    "body": 'The climax of the priestly blessing that Aaron and his descendants were instructed to pronounce on the people of Israel came with these words: “So they shall put My name on the children of Israel, and I will bless them”  (Numbers 6:27).\nOften, the most effective prayers we can offer on behalf of others are prayers of praise and thanksgiving, invoking the name of the Lord Jesus on them. When we put the name of Jesus on those for whom we are praying, we invoke God’s blessing on them. Few of us realise how much we uplift people in their spirits when we simply praise God for them. It is a major part of our ministry as intercessors.\n“Praying Hyde” was an outstanding missionary in the Punjab in India in the last century, when India was still under British rule. Hyde’s ministry was prayer; everything else was secondary. Early on, he came across an Indian evangelist whom he considered ineffective and cold.\nAs he began to pray about this man, he said, “Lord, You know—” he was going to say, “—how cold Brother So-and-so is.” But the Holy Spirit stopped him with Proverbs 30:10: “Do not slander a servant to his master”  (niv).\nSo, Brother Hyde changed his approach. He began to think of everything good in that man’s life and to thank God for him. Within a few months, that man became outstandingly successful as an evangelist.\nWhat changed him? Not being accused in prayer, but being the object of thanksgiving.\nGod has taught me that if I cannot thank Him for somebody, I probably have no right to pray for that person. I had better not pray at all because my prayer may do more harm than good. As Numbers 6:27 says, “So they shall put My name on the children of Israel, and I will bless them.”',
