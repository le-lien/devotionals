        "body": 'In Philippians 2, Paul said that we need to follow Jesus’ example. I always say that our attitudes determine our approaches, and our approaches determine the outcome. Here is the attitude we need to cultivate: <i>“Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant”</i> (Philippians 2:5–7 nasb). The Greek word translated “bond-servant”  literally means “slave.” So, we see that Jesus, who was Lord of all, emptied Himself and was willing to become a bondservant, a slave. We must imitate His attitude.\nPaul penned a beautiful, parallel passage in Galatians:\n<i>For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh [do not gratify your own fleshly, selfish desires] , but through love serve one another.\nFor the whole Law is fulfilled in one word, in the statement, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”</i> (Galatians 5:13–14 nasb)\nLooking outward at others is the way in which we free ourselves from indulging in our fleshly natures or yielding to selfishness. We are to serve one another in love. I believe that the Holy Spirit is emphasizing this loving, selfless attitude to God’s people today. Many people talk about serving the Lord but never serve their fellow believers. I do not know how much you can really serve the Lord if you are not willing to serve your fellow believers, because the Lord comes to us in the members of His body. Our attitude toward those members is really our attitude toward the Lord Himself.',

        "body": 'In connection with our being willing to serve others, I want to look at another passage from the apostle Paul—something that he wrote to the Corinthian Christians. By his background, Paul was a strict, observant, orthodox Jew. He was a Pharisee, and he had the qualifications to be a rabbi. His was the kind of righteousness that caused him to separate himself from other people, whom he regarded on a lower level or even despised.\nBut when he came to know Jesus, the most wonderful change took place in his nature. Bear in mind that the people of Corinth were basically the scum of the earth. In this epistle, Paul said that some of them had been homosexuals, some prostitutes, some drunkards, and some revilers. They were just not the best kind of people. Corinth was one of the major seaports of the ancient world, and, like many seaports, the city was filled with these sorts of people.\nBut let’s look at this astonishing statement of Paul: <i>“For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your bondservants for Jesus’ sake”</i> (2 Corinthians 4:5 nasb).\nHere is this proud Pharisee saying, “We are your slaves for the sake of Jesus”—even to the likes of the people of Corinth!\nNotice the three steps. First, dethrone self:  <i>“not...ourselves.”</i> Second, enthrone Christ: <i>“Christ Jesus as Lord.”</i>  Third, serve others:“[we are]  <i>your bond-servants for Jesus’ sake.”</i>  Those three steps are so important. By love, serve others. That’s the message: escape from self-centeredness.',

        "body": 'Serving is a skill that we have to acquire. It is not something that just happens, and it is certainly not ours by nature. For example, a server in a restaurant is a person who, in a sense, is called to serve. But a server needs to be trained. I have a friend who used to be a server, and he once explained to me all that is involved in being a <i>good</i> server.\nOnce I understood the training process, I realised that it does not just happen; serving is a skill we have to acquire. We have to study others to find out what produces a positive response, not a negative one. We are to study others to provoke them to love and good deeds, not to the opposite. Serving requires practice, training, and discipline. \nServing also requires the right environment. After saying, <i>“Let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds”</i> (Hebrews 10:24 nasb), the writer of Hebrews went on to say, <i>“Not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more, as you see the day drawing near”</i> (verse 25 nasb). We must learn to serve in the right environment, which is expressed in the words <i>“our own assembling together.”</i>  It means close, committed, regular fellowship.\n In the next verse, the writer presented the disastrous alternative. Immediately after he warned us not to forsake our own assembling together, he said, <i>“For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a certain terrifying expectation of judgment”</i> (verses 26–27 nasb). The implication is that if we do not stay in the right environment—if we are not in close, committed, regular fellowship—we will go back to sinning.\nThe only safe way is to stay in fellowship, consider other people, and learn to serve them joyfully.',

But I would like to look back to Hebrews 3:1, where the same word, “consider,”  is used. It reads, “Consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Christ Jesus.”  If we consider Jesus, we will end up considering one another. But it is important that we do it in that order. We consider Jesus first; then, we consider one another. It makes a great deal of difference whether I relate to you as just a person or as a person in Christ.\nMy mind goes back to an incident that happened while I was the principal of a college that trained teachers in East Africa. For every vacancy that allowed us to accept one student, there were at least ten suitable applicants. One girl actually walked twenty-four miles barefoot just to get an interview. You can hardly conceive the desperate hunger people in Africa had for getting an education. Education was the key to success in life, as they saw it.\nOne day, an elderly mother came to me on behalf of her son, a prospective student. He was not exactly suitable for the school, however, and we had not accepted him. His mother was pestering me to the point that I was growing annoyed with her. In Africa, they do not believe in democracy; they believe in the chief, the strong man. He is the one who matters. This woman kept telling me, “You are the great one; what you say goes.” I got so irritated that I was about to give her a piece of my mind—and it was not my sanctified mind, either! That is when the Lord spoke to me, very gently, saying, "Remember, she’s one of My children. Be careful how you treat her." I repented. She really was a dear, precious woman, and a child of God.

I think it was used deliberately in order to make us think.\nWhat do we usually provoke from other people? Anger or jealousy. But we are to provoke to <i>“love and to good works.”</i>\nThe Greek word translated <i>“provoke”</i>  is the same word from which the English word <i>paroxysm</i> is derived. Do you know what a paroxysm is? It is an absolutely uncontrollable outburst of emotion, such as anger, or even laughter.\nAlthough the word <i>provoke</i>  often suggests something bad, in this context, it is turned to the good, for we are to provoke one another to love and good works. And let me just point out that there are certain people whom you’ll <i>have</i>  to provoke if you want them to do the right thing. Moreover, you will have to consider <i>how</i> to provoke them.\nThis is one of my weaknesses. I don’t like having to consider people’s personalities. With a military background and a rather logical mind, it is sufficient for me just to tell the person to do something. But the Bible tells us to consider <i>how</i> to tell them, because if you want the right result from one person, you have to tell him in quite a different way from the way in which you might tell another person. Anybody who has children knows this is true—you cannot treat them all the same. You can scold one child and get the right result. But if you scold another child, you might just discourage or defeat him.',

We may find ourselves side-by-side with unbelievers every day—in our homes, in our workplaces, or in other activities of daily life. In such situations, our Christian testimony requires us to be friendly, courteous, and helpful. But we are not free to share with unbelievers that which is morally or spiritually impure or dishonoring to Christ. In this realm, we must follow Paul’s exhortation in 2 Corinthians 6:17: <i>“Do not touch what is unclean.”</i>  If we are sensitive to the Holy Spirit, He will always warn us of these defiling contacts and show us how to protect ourselves from them.\nHowever, the surest protection against wrong fellowship is right fellowship. As God’s children, we are heirs to innumerable joys and blessings of which the world knows nothing. In fact, Paul told us that our Father God <i>“has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ”</i> (Ephesians 1:3).

But it just so happens that, in the original Greek, the first phrase, <i>“let us...lay aside every encumbrance,”</i>  is not found in that form. Instead, it is a participle that reads like this: “Laying aside every encumbrance, let us run with endurance the race.” The real “let us” phrase in the above verse, on which we will need to focus, is <i>“Let us run with endurance the race that is set before us.”</i>\nHere and elsewhere in the New Testament, the Christian life is compared to a race. This analogy implies a specific course marked out before us in advance. Success in the Christian life consists in completing the course in accordance with the rules of the competition.\nIn light of the fact that we are confronted with this race that is set before us, we need to see that there are four requirements for successfully completing the race. Each one of these requirements is found in the New Testament: (1) the right mental attitude, (2) self-control, (3) endurance, and (4) having our eyes fixed on Jesus.

This truth was exemplified by the words of Paul as he spoke about his relationship to Jesus Christ: <i>“That I may know Him, and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death; in order that I may attain to the resurrection from the dead”</i> (Philippians 3:10–11 nasb).\nPaul had a specific objective. He did not run aimlessly. (See 1 Corinthians 9:26.) He had an aim before him. He knew what the goal was, which determined his mental attitude. He continued, <i>“Not that I have already obtained it, or have already become perfect</i> [complete], <i>but I press on in order that I may lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus”</i> (verse 12 nasb). Paul’s vision was that Christ had laid hold of him for a purpose; fulfilling that purpose meant that he would have to relate to this purpose. He had to be determined that the purpose of Christ would become his purpose.\n<i>Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.</i> (verses 13–14 nasb)\nThe phrase <i>“I press on”</i>  occurs twice, once in verse 12 and once in verse 14. That is the mental attitude we need to share with Paul: <i>“I press on. I have a goal. I have not yet arrived, but I know where I’m headed.”</i>\nThe last time Paul used that phrase, he said, “I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.”  There is a reward for those who successfully complete the race.

The same principle still applies.\n<i>Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but only one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may win.</i> (1 Corinthians 9:24 nasb)\nThat is the objective. Then, Paul went on to state the condition:\n <i>And everyone who competes in the games exercises self-control in all things. They then do it to receive a perishable wreath [the prize] , but we an imperishable.</i>(verse 25 nasb)\nIf we are going to win the race, if we are going to win the prize, we must meet the condition of self-control. This truth is so obvious when we think in terms of athletics. Every athlete who succeeds as an athlete today has to exercise the most rigorous self-control. He has to go into training—controlling what he eats, how much sleep he gets, and the amount of exercise he has. He also has to control his psychology, building up the right kind of attitude. He cannot afford to give way to negative thoughts.

When God commits us to something, we have to set our faces to fulfill it and go through with it. There is a close relationship between self-control and endurance.\nWithout self-control, we will not achieve endurance. We must master our weaknesses; otherwise, every time we are tested in the area of endurance, some weakness—whether it is emotional, psychological, or physical—will get us down, and we will give up at the very point where we should have been holding on and enduring.\nYet another condition for a successful race is to have our eyes fixed on Jesus. As is stated in Hebrews, <i>“Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross”</i> (Hebrews 12:2 nasb).\nWe have to look continually to Jesus.

Paul went on to say that we rejoice not only in the light of the future, but also in what the present offers: <i>“And not only in that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope”</i> (verses 3–4). Where verse 3 uses the word <i>“glory,”</i>  the original Greek word means “to rejoice, boast, or exult.” We should exult in tribulation because of what tribulation does. The <i>New American Standard Bible</i> says, <i>“Tribulation brings about perseverance; and perseverance, proven character; and proven character, hope.”</i>  Perseverance produces  <i>proven</i>  character in us. This is the heart of endurance—character that has stood the test. As Paul wrote, <i>“Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us”</i> (Romans 5:5).\nLove is a matter of character. In essence, we are dealing with the formation of our characters. We rejoice in tribulation, for tribulation is the only thing that produces perseverance. And perseverance produces proven character. I know men with whom I have walked and shared hardship, opposition, misrepresentation, and misunderstanding. But today, for me, their character is proven; I know I can trust them.

Therefore, one of the key words that Hebrews emphasizes is this word that we are looking at:  <i>endurance.</i>\n<i>And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope until the end, that you do not become sluggish, but imitate those who through faith and patience</i> <i> inherit the promises.</i> (Hebrews 6:11–12)\nFaith and endurance. Some people will tell you that faith is all you need to claim God’s promise. But that is not true. You need faith and endurance. It takes both. As the author of Hebrews continued, <i>“Therefore do not cast away your confidence, which has great reward. For you have need of endurance, so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise”</i> (Hebrews 10:35–36).\nThe word <i>confidence</i>  means that you have freedom of speech. You can talk boldly about Jesus—about what He has done for you and what He is will do for you. You have done the will of God, but you have not yet received the promises. What do you need? Endurance. You need to hold out from the point where you did God’s will and claimed the promise to the point where you actually receive the promise. Some people do the will of God and claim the promise, but they don’t hold out. Then, they say that it didn’t work. But it will not work without endurance. You need faith and endurance. ',

This brings out the association between grace and thanks.\nThis connection is also found in various modern Romance languages.\nIn French, for instance, they say, “<i>Grâce</i> à Dieu,”  which means “Thanks to God”; in Italian, it is <i>“grazie,”</i>  and in Spanish, it is <i>“gracias.”</i>  All are taken from the same word for <i>grace</i>.\nIt is easy to see this connection between grace and thanks. In light of this fact, I want to tell you that you cannot have the grace of God in your life unless you practice giving thanks. Grace and thanks go together.

How would we feel if they never said “thank you” or showed their gratitude, if they just accepted everything we did for them as if it were by right, merely taking it for granted?\nUnfortunately, that is how many of God’s children treat Him—and it is not pleasing in His sight. We are required to appreciate what God does for us and to take the time to express our appreciation. One of my favorite verses is in Proverbs: <i>“In all your ways acknowledge Him [God],and He shall direct your paths” (Proverbs 3:6).</i>\nI have learned by experience that if I pause at every stage in life to acknowledge God, I can be confident that He will continue to direct my path. You might ask, “How can I acknowledge God?” The simplest and best way is to thank Him—say “Thank You” for all He has done and for His faithfulness. You will get immediate assurance that He is going to continue to be faithful. Just as He has helped and guided you in the past, He will guide you in the future. But the key to this assurance is acknowledging Him by our thanksgiving.\nWhen I was in East Africa, I discovered that in the language of my adopted African daughter’s tribe, they had no word or phrase that meant “thank you.” Can you imagine not being able to say “thank you”?\nI then realised that it is only where the Bible has come that people have learned to say “thank you.” It is part of the grace of God.',

The writer made a parallel application from the Old Testament, when God spoke to the people of Israel through Moses:\n<i>See to it that you do not refuse Him who is speaking. For if those did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, much less shall we [believers in the New Testament]  escape who turn away from Him who warns from heaven. And His voice shook the earth then, but now He has promised, saying, “Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also the heaven.”\nAnd this expression, “Yet once more,” denotes the removing of those things which can be shaken, as of created things, in order that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.</i> (Hebrews 12:25–27 NASB)\nThankfulness is the appropriate response to the particular privileges and benefits that we have in God. We are not dependent on a shakable kingdom. We have an eternal kingdom, an unshakable kingdom, the kingdom of God Himself, the kingdom that is <i>“righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit”</i>  (Romans 14:17 nasb). In the midst of all that is being shaken around us—all the distress, uncertainty, perplexity, confusion, hatred, division, war, and fear - we have an unshakable kingdom. We have peace, security, and purpose. What is the appropriate response? There is only one: it is thankfulness. <i>“Therefore, since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us show gratitude”</i>\n(Hebrews 12:28); let us express our thanks to God.',

    "body": 'Thankfulness, or gratitude, is the appropriate response to what God has done—and is still doing—for us. It is something that we owe to God, something we need to pay. But the expression of our appreciation also does something in our own spirits that nothing else can do.\nI express it in this way: Thankfulness releases our spirits for acceptable worship and service. That is why the writer of Hebrews said,<i>“Let us show gratitude, by which we may offer to God an acceptable service with reverence and awe”</i>  (Hebrews 12:28 nasb). Without gratitude, our services to God will not be acceptable. It is that “attitude of gratitude” that makes our services acceptable and releases our spirits.An unthankful person is bound up in himself. He is self-centered.He really cannot know true liberation. But thankfulness releases our spirits.\n<i>In everything give thanks; for this</i> [giving thanks]  <i>is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus. Do not quench the Spirit.</i> (1 Thessalonians 5:18–19 nasb)\nThat is a clear commandment: if we do not give thanks, we are being disobedient. We are also out of the will of God. In addition, failing to give thanks quenches the Spirit. The only release for the Spirit—to serve God acceptably—is through thanksgiving.\nThen, notice the warning that concludes Hebrews 12: “For our God is a consuming fire” (verse 29).

Now, look at the disintegration of character, morality, and standards. Paul said,\n<i>But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God—having a form of godliness but denying its power.

I would predict that, if you go over that list again, you will find that most of these character defects are already conspicuous in our contemporary culture. And, right there in the middle of the list, it says that people are <i>“disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love.”</i> Notice the association. The ungrateful are right next door to the unholy. You cannot be holy and remain ungrateful. Since our God is a consuming fire (see, for example, Hebrews 12:29), He requires that we serve Him with holiness, which is appropriate. We also have to serve Him with gratitude.

Thankfulness, like most important attitudes of the Christian life, originates in the will, not in the emotions. We do not have to feel thankful in order to be thankful. Those who have children train them to say “thank you.” In Britain, children are expected to say “thank you” even before they receive anything. It is simply a matter of proper conduct.\nGod often deals with us in that way, requiring us to say “thank you” before we actually receive something. Oftentimes, if we wait to receive it first, we will not get it.\n<i>And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.</i> (Colossians 3:15–17)\nThis passage makes two demands of us: to do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus, and to give thanks while doing them. These instructions apply to every task, whether it’s scrubbing the kitchen floor, cleaning the bathroom, driving the car, or writing a letter.\nThat gives us a pretty good gauge of right and wrong. If there is anything that we cannot honestly do in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks all the while, then we’d better not do it. This method cuts away a whole list of do’s and don’ts.

Giving thanks is a principle that should guide all that we do. (See <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/114/COL.3.NKJV?parallel=151">Colossians 3:15–17.</a>) Let’s look at three short but no less important verses, starting with 1 Thessalonians 5:16–18: <i>“Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.”</i> There are three simple instructions in those verses: rejoice always, pray without ceasing, and in everything give thanks. Concerning the giving thanks in everything, Paul said, “This is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.” When we are not giving thanks, we are not fulfilling the will of God. In other words, we are out of God’s will. How important it is to understand that!\nThe second thing I want to say about thankfulness, or thanksgiving, is that it is an essential expression of the fullness of the Spirit. Paul wrote, “Do not quench the Spirit”  (verse 19). Here is what he said to the Ephesians: <i>“So then do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled with the [Holy]  Spirit”</i>  (Ephesians 5:17–18 nasb).\nPaul provided us with a negative, followed by a positive, regarding the will of the Lord. If we do not understand these truths about God’s will, then we are foolish. Each exhortation is equally valid. It is wrong for a Christian to get drunk with wine, but it is equally wrong for a Christian not to be filled with the Holy Spirit. Sometimes, as religious people, we focus so much on the negative—not filling ourselves with wine so that we become drunk—that we forget about the positive—being filled with the Holy Spirit. We need to be filled with the Spirit.',

Hence, let us go out to Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach. For here we do not have a lasting city, but we are seeking the city which is to come.\n(Hebrews 13:12–14 nasb)\nThis passage deals with our attitude and relationship to this present world. It is telling us that our home is not in this world. We have no enduring place in this world. The world rejected Jesus. It drove Him out of the city and crucified Him outside the gate.\nThe Scripture always emphasizes the fact that Jesus’ crucifixion took place outside the city wall. Jesus was rejected. He was put out of society; the world did not want Him. And the way in which the world treated Jesus, sooner or later, and in one way or another, is going to be the way in which the world will treat you and me, as believers. We must be willing to go out to Him—to the place of crucifixion, rejection, and shame—bearing His reproach. Elsewhere in Hebrews, it says that the reproach of Christ amounts to greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt. (See Hebrews 11:26.) So, His reproach becomes our glory.\nThen, the writer gave a beautiful reason:  “For here we do not have a lasting city.”  Other people may think that this world is permanent, but we know that it is not. “But we are seeking the city which is to come.”\nI like this translation because it says the city. There is one specific city that is the destination and the home of all true believers. It is where we really belong.\nThank You, Lord, that You are calling me to leave this world behind.

Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God” (James 4:4 niv). James called these people “adulterous.”  Becoming part of the bride of Christ, the church, requires a spiritual commitment—the bride must be single-hearted, totally committed and devoted to Jesus.

The other goat, which was called azazel, or “scapegoat”  (Leviticus 16:8), was led away into the wilderness. It was led off into an uninhabited land to wander there hopelessly and die of thirst. It never returned.\nJesus was the scapegoat in the figure of the Day of Atonement.\nHe was banished from the presence of Almighty God. Jesus is actually typified by both goats. As the sin offering, He died on the cross. But as the scapegoat, He was banished from the presence of God, enduring our rejection for us. The opposite of banishment is acceptance. That is stated in Ephesians 1:6:  “He made us accepted in the Beloved.”\nWe must all understand that we are accepted. Again, one of the most common problems that people have in modern America is the feeling of rejection. In any given congregation, I can guarantee that there are several people who are struggling with feelings of rejection.\nIn most cases, these feelings are due to their parents—growing up, they may have never believed that their parents really wanted them, and so they never learned to feel accepted. They go through life feeling rejected, unhappy, unable to integrate with other people, and unable to show love, because they have never experienced love.\nI have learned by experience that one of the great keys to helping such people is to impart to them the assurance that they are accepted by God.

It indicated ahead of time that through Jesus Christ Himself, God would intervene to bring salvation to His people. All this was fulfilled in Jesus. He came to reveal God and to bring His salvation and healing to everyone. Peter, an eyewitness of the earthly ministry of Jesus, summed it up: “God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him” (Acts 10:38).\nThe gospel of John applies Isaiah’s prophecy directly to Jesus: But although He had done so many signs [miracles] before them, they did not believe in Him, that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke: “Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”\n(John 12:37–38)\nWe must hold fast to our belief in Him who fulfilled the Old Testament prophecies. Even many of those who witnessed firsthand the miracles of Jesus were incredulous. Let us not demand signs and wonders, which do not guarantee belief, but let us maintain faith in the One who earned our salvation, the greatest miracle of all. ',

    "body": 'Isaiah 53:2 gives a prophetic description of Jesus’ early years on earth:\n“For He shall grow up before Him as a tender plant, and as a root out of dry ground. He has no form or comeliness; and when we see Him, there is no beauty that we should desire Him.”  From youth to adulthood, Jesus grew up like a sturdy plant, upright and God-fearing in all His ways.\nThis fact is also described in Luke 2:40: “And the Child grew and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.”\nAt the same time, Jesus was “a root out of dry ground.”  He came forth as God’s messenger to Israel at a period of prolonged spiritual poverty.\nIsrael had not received any prophetic revelation for nearly three hundred years. This prophetic silence was broken only by John the Baptist, then Jesus Himself, who both proclaimed the coming of God’s kingdom.\nJesus had no special outward splendor that would reveal His true identity to people. They saw in Him nothing more than the son of Joseph the carpenter. (See Matthew 13:54–55.) When Peter acknowledged Him as the Messiah and Son of God, Jesus said that this revelation came not through Peter’s natural senses; rather, it was given to him by God the Father. (See Matthew 16:17.) The prophecy continues, “He is despised and rejected by men, a Man of sorrows [pains]  and acquainted with grief\n[disease].  And we hid, as it were, our faces from Him; He was despised, and we did not esteem Him” (Isaiah 53:3). Jesus did not seek the favor of the wealthy. Instead, He devoted Himself tirelessly to helping the poor and the suffering. He faced pain and disease, eventually taking upon Himself the pain and disease of the whole human race. Hanging on the cross in shame and agony, He became “like one from whom men hide their face” (Isaiah 53:3 nasb).\nThank You, Lord, that You are calling me to leave this world behind. I proclaim that although Jesus was despised and rejected by men, I receive Him and esteem Him as Messiah, the Son of God. I shall go forth to Him outside the camp.

    "body": 'This is the twelfth and final “Let us” resolution from the book of Hebrews: “Through Him [Jesus]  then, let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that give thanks to His name” (Hebrews 13:15 nasb). To me, this resolution is very appropriate and beautiful because it is something we are instructed to keep on doing. If we continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, all year long, it will make all the difference as to what the year holds for each of us.This final step of offering up a sacrifice of praise to God relates directly, and in a practical way, to the two previous steps, which were,\n“Let us show gratitude” and “Let us go forth to Him outside the gate.”\nGratitude naturally leads to praise. There are many passages in the Bible in which thanksgiving is related to praise. One of the most beautiful is Psalm 100:4: “Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts with praise.”  The first step in gaining access to God is thanksgiving; the second step is praise. Thanksgiving leads to praise. It finds expression in praise, and it flows out in praise.\nThe step just before this one, “Let us go forth to Him outside the camp,” brings us release from the two slaveries of pleasing self and pleasing the world. Again, this step is directly related to offering the sacrifice of praise. You might not see it at first, but there are two hindrances to spontaneous, free-flowing praise in our lives: love of self and love of the world. As long as our affections are centered in ourselves or in the world, we are not really free to praise God. The cross removes these two hindrances and sets us free to praise God.\nThank You, Lord. I give You praise. I proclaim that I remove all hindrances and that I offer up praise to God—“the fruit of lips that give thanks to His name.” I shall continually offer up a sacrifice of praise. Amen. ',

    "body": 'The cross of Jesus removes the hindrances of pleasing ourselves and pleasing the world. Then, when we are no longer affected by what happens to ourselves, we cease to be significantly affected by our moods, problems, or apparent adversity. What goes on in the world around us no longer affects us.\nWe may sit and listen to the news, and, afterwards, get up thinking that the situation in the world is pretty bad—there are crises, disasters, crime, immorality. But we need to see that the world does not dominate us, that it does not dominate our thinking. We are in the world but not of the world. When we are released from slavery to the world—when the world no longer controls our thinking and we have been liberated by the cross in our inner attitude toward the world—then there is nothing left to hinder our praise.\nWe do not praise God just when things are going right in the world or with ourselves. We praise God because He is worthy to be praised.\nOur liberated spirits are not entangled with self-love and the love of the world.\nYou can find out a lot about a person when you study how much praising he does. Is he a slave to the old man, or has he entered into the resurrected life of the new man? The old man is a grumbler. When we hear a person grumbling, we know that is the old man speaking. But the new man is a praiser. Which are you? The old man says, “I can’t take this any longer,” “Things are getting too bad,” “Nobody treats me right,” “What’s wrong with the world?” The new man says, “Hallelujah!\nPraise the Lord! I’m free. I’m a child of God. Heaven is my home. God loves me.”\nWhich of these attitudes is yours? ',

    "body": 'Let’s look at a verse from the book of Proverbs that points to the importance of what we say with our mouths:\nDeath and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruit.\n(Proverbs 18:21)\nTwo things come from the use of the tongue: death and life. If we grumble, or if we are negative or self-centered, our tongues will bring forth death. But if we are liberated from all of that negativity and are walking in the praise and worship of God, our tongues will bring forth life. Additionally, whatever fruit our tongues bring forth, whether sweet or bitter, we are going to eat of it.\nLet’s go back to our pattern verse for this week. I’d like to bring out one more important point from it. The writer said, Through Him [Jesus]  then, let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God.\n(Hebrews 13:15 nasb)\nOne very significant word in this verse is “sacrifice.”  Praise is a sacrifice. According to the principles of Scripture, a sacrifice requires a death. In the Old Testament sacrifices, nothing was ever offered to God that had not passed through death. So, we see that the sacrifice of praise requires a death—the death of the old man. The old man cannot praise God as He deserves to be praised. There has to be a death.\nAgain, we know that a sacrifice costs us something; thus, praise is costly. Let me put it this way: we need to praise God most when we least feel like it. Praise cannot depend on our feelings. It is a sacrifice of our spirits.\nThank You, Lord. I give You praise. I proclaim that praise is a sacrifice, praise is costly, and, whether I feel like it or not, I give God praise. I shall continually offer up a sacrifice of praise. Amen. ',

    "body": 'Let’s look at the example of King David in Psalm 34. The introduction to this psalm says, “A psalm of David when he feigned madness before Abimelech [or Achish],  who drove him away and he departed” (nasb).\nAt this time in his life, David was a fugitive from his own country.\nKing Saul was trying to kill him, so David had to leave his familiar surroundings.\nHe went to the court of a Gentile king for refuge, but the king suspected him of being an enemy. In order to save his own life, he had to feign madness. The historic book of 1 Samuel tells us that he scratched at the door and slobbered on his beard. (See 1 Samuel 21:10–15.) That was the situation. But what was David’s reaction?\nI will bless the Lord at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth. My soul shall make its boast in the Lord; the humble shall hear it and rejoice. O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt His name together.\n(Psalm 34:1–3 nasb)\nRight there, in the midst of such a terrible situation, with his life hanging in the balance and the shame of having to feign madness, David praised the Lord. That is the sacrifice of praise. When he was at his lowest, David decided to go on boasting in the Lord. When there was nothing else to boast about, he decided to boast in the Lord.\nThen, David went on,  “O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt His name together.”  Praise is contagious. If we learn to praise God in this way, others will join in. But grumbling is contagious, too. If we grumble, we will attract fellow grumblers. We must learn to offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually. ',

    "body": 'When I was serving in the British army during World War II, I was stationed in the deserts of North Africa. One negative aspect of desert living conditions is that they tend to provoke murmuring and complaining. This happened with Israel many times, and it often brought God’s judgment and disfavor upon them. I got so weary of the desert, the food, and the blaspheming British soldiers that I began to complain. When I did this, I lost the sense of God’s presence and blessing.\nI decided to set aside a special day to fast and to ask God why His presence seemed to have withdrawn from me. I said, “God, why are You not near to me? Why do I have to continue this monotonous, wearisome life in the desert?” By evening, God had given me the answer. He spoke to me very clearly, saying, “Why have you not thanked Me? Why have you not praised Me?” As I meditated on what God said, I realised that I had lost the sense of His presence because I had become unthankful.\nIn due course, the Holy Spirit directed me to various passages along this line, including 1 Thessalonians 5:16–19: “Rejoice always; pray without ceasing; in everything give thanks; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus. Do not quench the Spirit” (nasb). Again, the implication is that if we do not rejoice always, pray without ceasing, and give thanks in everything, we are quenching the Holy Spirit! By murmuring and complaining instead of praising and giving thanks, I had quenched the Holy Spirit in my life.\nGod expects us to continually offer up a sacrifice of praise from our lips—not just inwardly from our hearts. We have to make our praise vocal by giving thanks to the name of the Lord! ',

    "body": 'As we have seen, thankfulness is a direct command of Scripture and an indispensable mark of being filled with the Holy Spirit.\nThese facts lead to two practical conclusions that apply to each of us personally: first, an unthankful Christian is disobedient; second, an unthankful Christian is not full of the Holy Spirit.\nThanksgiving is also a requirement for entering God’s presence, as we read in Psalm 100:4–5: “Enter His gates with thanksgiving, and His courts with praise. Give thanks to Him; bless His name. For the Lord is good; His lovingkindness is everlasting, and His faithfulness to all generations” (nasb). Two essential stages in our approach to God are entering the gates with thanksgiving and entering the courts with praise.\nAgain, the psalmist also gave three specific reasons that we should thank God. First, “the Lord is good” ; second, “His lovingkindness is everlasting” ; and, third, “His faithfulness [is]  to all generations.”  Each of these is permanent and unchanging. God is always good; His lovingkindness is everlasting; His faithfulness is to all generations. The primary reasons for giving thanks to God never depend on our feelings or circumstances. We may feel up one day, down the next; sometimes we are encouraged, other times discouraged. But there is no reason to change our attitude of thankfulness to God.\nIn order to approach God on the basis of these three eternal facts, we need to change our focus. We need to look away from things that irritate, discourage, or provoke us, looking instead at the eternal things, which we see through eyes of faith. When we come to God with the right focus, we are in a position to hear from God and to receive from Him. ',

    "body": 'Praise is a spiritual weapon that we can use to silence the devil.\nThere is perhaps no more important fact in the Bible than this.\nFrom the point of view of practical Christian living, God has given you a way to silence the devil’s mouth. Psalm 8:2 says, “Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have ordained strength, because of Your enemies, that You may silence the enemy and the avenger.”  The psalmist, addressing God, was speaking about “enemies”  in the plural and “the enemy and the avenger”  in the singular. “The enemy and the avenger”\nis none other than the devil himself;  “enemies”  are the evil spirits that are Satan’s instruments against us. Because of Satan and his evil spirits, God has ordained strength that we might silence the devil.\nThis verse was quoted by Jesus in the gospel of Matthew. The quotation is a revelation of the full meaning of this passage. In this scene, Jesus is in the temple, healing the sick, and the children are running to and fro, crying, “Hosanna to the Son of David!” (Matthew 21:15). This upsets the religious leaders, so they say to Jesus, “Do You hear what they are saying?” Jesus then gives us this revelation: “Yes.\nHave you never read, ‘Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have perfected praise’?” (verse 16). Where the psalmist said, “You have ordained strength,”  Jesus said, “You have perfected praise.”  So, we get a simple, direct inference. The “ordained strength” of God’s people in battle is “perfected praise.” God has made it possible for us to silence the devil and all his evil spirits by perfect praise.\nAs “babes and infants,” if we will but praise God perfectly, out of our mouths will come forth a weapon that silences the devil. And God will be glorified.\nThank You, Lord. I give You praise. I proclaim that by my ',

    "body": 'The climax of the priestly blessing that Aaron and his descendants were instructed to pronounce on the people of Israel came with these words: “So they shall put My name on the children of Israel, and I will bless them”  (Numbers 6:27).\nOften, the most effective prayers we can offer on behalf of others are prayers of praise and thanksgiving, invoking the name of the Lord Jesus on them. When we put the name of Jesus on those for whom we are praying, we invoke God’s blessing on them. Few of us realise how much we uplift people in their spirits when we simply praise God for them. It is a major part of our ministry as intercessors.\n“Praying Hyde” was an outstanding missionary in the Punjab in India in the last century, when India was still under British rule. Hyde’s ministry was prayer; everything else was secondary. Early on, he came across an Indian evangelist whom he considered ineffective and cold.\nAs he began to pray about this man, he said, “Lord, You know—” he was going to say, “—how cold Brother So-and-so is.” But the Holy Spirit stopped him with Proverbs 30:10: “Do not slander a servant to his master”  (niv).\nSo, Brother Hyde changed his approach. He began to think of everything good in that man’s life and to thank God for him. Within a few months, that man became outstandingly successful as an evangelist.\nWhat changed him? Not being accused in prayer, but being the object of thanksgiving.\nGod has taught me that if I cannot thank Him for somebody, I probably have no right to pray for that person. I had better not pray at all because my prayer may do more harm than good. As Numbers 6:27 says, “So they shall put My name on the children of Israel, and I will bless them.”\nThank You, Lord. I give You praise. I proclaim that I do not\n“slander a servant” but instead invoke God’s blessing on him or her. I shall continually offer up a sacrifice of praise.

He also studied several modern languages, including Hebrew and Aramaic, at Cambridge University and the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.\nWhile serving with the British army in World War II, he began to study the Bible and experienced a life-changing encounter with Jesus Christ. Out of this encounter he formed two conclusions: first, that Jesus Christ is alive; second, that the Bible is a true, relevant, up-to-date book. These conclusions altered the whole course of his life, which he then devoted to studying and teaching the Bible.\nDerek’s main gift of explaining the Bible and its teaching in a clear and simple way has helped build a foundation of faith in millions of lives. His non-denominational, non-sectarian approach has made his teaching equally relevant and helpful to people from all racial and religious backgrounds.\nHe is the author of over 50 books, 600 audio and 100 video teachings, many of which have been translated and published in more than 100\nlanguages. His daily radio broadcast is translated into Arabic, Chinese (Amoy, Cantonese, Mandarin, Shanghaiese, Swatow), Croatian, German, Malagasy, Mongolian, Russian, Samoan, Spanish, Bahasa Indonesian and Tongan. The radio program continues to reach many people around the world.\nDerek Prince Ministries continues its ministry of reaching out to believers in over 140 countries with Derek’s teachings, fulfilling the mandate to keep on “until Jesus returns”.
