So we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (Romans 5:1).\nPeace with God. What will that be like? Have you even been in a gym filled with people screaming for their favorite team? Or at a concert filled with loud music and loud fans? Or stuck between two people arguing at the top of their voices? And then … you stepped outside. Your heart stopped pounding, your breathing slowed. How quiet, how … peaceful.\nPeace with God will be a zillion times better than that. When you get to heaven, there will be no more screaming, loudness, or arguing. There will be only love and joy and peace. It will be better than peace between countries, better than peace between friends, and better than peace at home.\nWe will have peace with God. ',

But “those who were sick.”\nSurely, among the many thousands, there were a few people who didn’t deserve good health. The same God who gave Jesus the power to heal also gave Him the power to see into people’s hearts. I wonder if Jesus was ever tempted to say to the liar, “Get out of here, buddy, and take your tales with you.”\nAnd Jesus could not only see their past, but He could also see their future. There were surely those in the crowds who would use their new health to hurt others. Jesus healed tongues that might someday curse. He gave sight to eyes that could covet their neighbor’s things. He healed hands that could kill.\nEach time Jesus healed, He had to overlook the future and the past.\nSomething, by the way, that He still does today—for us. ',

Revelation says that, in heaven, Jesus “was dressed in a long robe. He had a gold band around his chest” (1:13). That is the type of robe and gold band that only priests used to wear. Jesus was wearing the clothing of a priest.\nYou have known other priests. They may or may not have been church leaders, but they were all people who wanted to bring you to God. But even these people needed a priest. These people, like you, were sinful. But not Jesus. “Jesus is the kind of high priest that we need. He is holy; he has no sin in him. He is pure and not influenced by sinners. And he is raised above the heavens” (Hebrews 7:26).\nJesus is the perfect Priest. ',

We are thirsty for God and His goodness.\nMatthew 5:6 says, “Those who want to do right more than anything else are happy.”\nThose who want to do right—that’s righteousness. That’s it. That’s what we are actually thirsty for. We’re thirsty for a clean heart. We crave a “do over.” When we mess up, we want a fresh start.

For “every perfect gift is from God.” And salvation is God’s greatest, most perfect gift of all. We just have to accept it.\nWrite this down and remember it: Salvation is given by God, powered by God, and created by God. It’s not something that we can earn.

One minute the shepherds were sound asleep; the next they were rubbing their eyes and staring into the face of an angel.\nThe night was no longer ordinary.\nThe angel came in the night because that is when lights are best seen and most needed.

Because the happiness and joys of this world don’t last forever. Because they aren’t true joy. <i>True joy</i>—the kind that lasts forever, through good times and bad—comes only from God.\nTrue joy doesn’t come from getting to do things; it comes from admitting that there are some things you can’t do—like forgive your own sins or save yourself.\nIt’s kind of funny.
