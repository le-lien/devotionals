        "body": 'In Philippians 2, Paul said that we need to follow Jesus’ example. I always say that our attitudes determine our approaches, and our approaches determine the outcome. Here is the attitude we need to cultivate: <i>“Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus, who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant”</i> (Philippians 2:5–7 nasb). The Greek word translated “bond-servant”  literally means “slave.” So, we see that Jesus, who was Lord of all, emptied Himself and was willing to become a bondservant, a slave. We must imitate His attitude.\nPaul penned a beautiful, parallel passage in Galatians:\n<i>For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh [do not gratify your own fleshly, selfish desires] , but through love serve one another.\nFor the whole Law is fulfilled in one word, in the statement, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”</i> (Galatians 5:13–14 nasb)\nLooking outward at others is the way in which we free ourselves from indulging in our fleshly natures or yielding to selfishness. We are to serve one another in love. I believe that the Holy Spirit is emphasizing this loving, selfless attitude to God’s people today. Many people talk about serving the Lord but never serve their fellow believers. I do not know how much you can really serve the Lord if you are not willing to serve your fellow believers, because the Lord comes to us in the members of His body. Our attitude toward those members is really our attitude toward the Lord Himself.',

        "body": 'In connection with our being willing to serve others, I want to look at another passage from the apostle Paul—something that he wrote to the Corinthian Christians. By his background, Paul was a strict, observant, orthodox Jew. He was a Pharisee, and he had the qualifications to be a rabbi. His was the kind of righteousness that caused him to separate himself from other people, whom he regarded on a lower level or even despised.\nBut when he came to know Jesus, the most wonderful change took place in his nature. Bear in mind that the people of Corinth were basically the scum of the earth. In this epistle, Paul said that some of them had been homosexuals, some prostitutes, some drunkards, and some revilers. They were just not the best kind of people. Corinth was one of the major seaports of the ancient world, and, like many seaports, the city was filled with these sorts of people.\nBut let’s look at this astonishing statement of Paul: <i>“For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your bondservants for Jesus’ sake”</i> (2 Corinthians 4:5 nasb).\nHere is this proud Pharisee saying, “We are your slaves for the sake of Jesus”—even to the likes of the people of Corinth!\nNotice the three steps. First, dethrone self:  <i>“not...ourselves.”</i> Second, enthrone Christ: <i>“Christ Jesus as Lord.”</i>  Third, serve others:“[we are]  <i>your bond-servants for Jesus’ sake.”</i>  Those three steps are so important. By love, serve others. That’s the message: escape from self-centeredness.',

        "body": 'Serving is a skill that we have to acquire. It is not something that just happens, and it is certainly not ours by nature. For example, a server in a restaurant is a person who, in a sense, is called to serve. But a server needs to be trained. I have a friend who used to be a server, and he once explained to me all that is involved in being a <i>good</i> server.\nOnce I understood the training process, I realised that it does not just happen; serving is a skill we have to acquire. We have to study others to find out what produces a positive response, not a negative one. We are to study others to provoke them to love and good deeds, not to the opposite. Serving requires practice, training, and discipline. \nServing also requires the right environment. After saying, <i>“Let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds”</i> (Hebrews 10:24 nasb), the writer of Hebrews went on to say, <i>“Not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more, as you see the day drawing near”</i> (verse 25 nasb). We must learn to serve in the right environment, which is expressed in the words <i>“our own assembling together.”</i>  It means close, committed, regular fellowship.\n In the next verse, the writer presented the disastrous alternative. Immediately after he warned us not to forsake our own assembling together, he said, <i>“For if we go on sinning willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a certain terrifying expectation of judgment”</i> (verses 26–27 nasb). The implication is that if we do not stay in the right environment—if we are not in close, committed, regular fellowship—we will go back to sinning.\nThe only safe way is to stay in fellowship, consider other people, and learn to serve them joyfully.',

I think it was used deliberately in order to make us think.\nWhat do we usually provoke from other people? Anger or jealousy. But we are to provoke to <i>“love and to good works.”</i>\nThe Greek word translated <i>“provoke”</i>  is the same word from which the English word <i>paroxysm</i> is derived. Do you know what a paroxysm is? It is an absolutely uncontrollable outburst of emotion, such as anger, or even laughter.\nAlthough the word <i>provoke</i>  often suggests something bad, in this context, it is turned to the good, for we are to provoke one another to love and good works. And let me just point out that there are certain people whom you’ll <i>have</i>  to provoke if you want them to do the right thing. Moreover, you will have to consider <i>how</i> to provoke them.\nThis is one of my weaknesses. I don’t like having to consider people’s personalities. With a military background and a rather logical mind, it is sufficient for me just to tell the person to do something. But the Bible tells us to consider <i>how</i> to tell them, because if you want the right result from one person, you have to tell him in quite a different way from the way in which you might tell another person. Anybody who has children knows this is true—you cannot treat them all the same. You can scold one child and get the right result. But if you scold another child, you might just discourage or defeat him.',

Or what harmony has Christ with Belial, or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever? Or what agreement has the temple of God with idols?

We may find ourselves side-by-side with unbelievers every day—in our homes, in our workplaces, or in other activities of daily life. In such situations, our Christian testimony requires us to be friendly, courteous, and helpful. But we are not free to share with unbelievers that which is morally or spiritually impure or dishonoring to Christ. In this realm, we must follow Paul’s exhortation in 2 Corinthians 6:17: <i>“Do not touch what is unclean.”</i>  If we are sensitive to the Holy Spirit, He will always warn us of these defiling contacts and show us how to protect ourselves from them.\nHowever, the surest protection against wrong fellowship is right fellowship. As God’s children, we are heirs to innumerable joys and blessings of which the world knows nothing. In fact, Paul told us that our Father God <i>“has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ”</i> (Ephesians 1:3). As we regularly share these blessings with the rest of God’s family, we are no longer attracted by the tawdry, impure pleasures of a world that is walking in darkness.',

But it just so happens that, in the original Greek, the first phrase, <i>“let us...lay aside every encumbrance,”</i>  is not found in that form. Instead, it is a participle that reads like this: “Laying aside every encumbrance, let us run with endurance the race.” The real “let us” phrase in the above verse, on which we will need to focus, is <i>“Let us run with endurance the race that is set before us.”</i>\nHere and elsewhere in the New Testament, the Christian life is compared to a race. This analogy implies a specific course marked out before us in advance. Success in the Christian life consists in completing the course in accordance with the rules of the competition.\nIn light of the fact that we are confronted with this race that is set before us, we need to see that there are four requirements for successfully completing the race. Each one of these requirements is found in the New Testament: (1) the right mental attitude, (2) self-control, (3) endurance, and (4) having our eyes fixed on Jesus.

He did not run aimlessly. (See 1 Corinthians 9:26.) He had an aim before him. He knew what the goal was, which determined his mental attitude. He continued, <i>“Not that I have already obtained it, or have already become perfect</i> [complete], <i>but I press on in order that I may lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus”</i> (verse 12 nasb). Paul’s vision was that Christ had laid hold of him for a purpose; fulfilling that purpose meant that he would have to relate to this purpose. He had to be determined that the purpose of Christ would become his purpose.\n<i>Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.</i> (verses 13–14 nasb)\nThe phrase <i>“I press on”</i>  occurs twice, once in verse 12 and once in verse 14. That is the mental attitude we need to share with Paul: <i>“I press on. I have a goal. I have not yet arrived, but I know where I’m headed.”</i>\nThe last time Paul used that phrase, he said, “I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.”  There is a reward for those who successfully complete the race.

The same principle still applies.\n<i>Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but only one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may win.</i> (1 Corinthians 9:24 nasb)\nThat is the objective. Then, Paul went on to state the condition:\n <i>And everyone who competes in the games exercises self-control in all things. They then do it to receive a perishable wreath [the prize] , but we an imperishable.</i>(verse 25 nasb)\nIf we are going to win the race, if we are going to win the prize, we must meet the condition of self-control. This truth is so obvious when we think in terms of athletics. Every athlete who succeeds as an athlete today has to exercise the most rigorous self-control. He has to go into training—controlling what he eats, how much sleep he gets, and the amount of exercise he has. He also has to control his psychology, building up the right kind of attitude. He cannot afford to give way to negative thoughts.

When God commits us to something, we have to set our faces to fulfill it and go through with it. There is a close relationship between self-control and endurance.\nWithout self-control, we will not achieve endurance. We must master our weaknesses; otherwise, every time we are tested in the area of endurance, some weakness—whether it is emotional, psychological, or physical—will get us down, and we will give up at the very point where we should have been holding on and enduring.\nYet another condition for a successful race is to have our eyes fixed on Jesus. As is stated in Hebrews, <i>“Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross”</i> (Hebrews 12:2 nasb).\nWe have to look continually to Jesus.

Remember, this is not a short sprint - it is a long, deliberate race.\nThe primary characteristic that is required is endurance. Many people start off the Christian life as if it were a dash. A little while later, they are panting beside the track; they are finished, and they have hardly begun the race.

        "body": 'Let’s consider some simple principles that will help us to cultivate endurance, reading first what Paul wrote in Romans 5:1–2:\n<i>“Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.”</i>  We rejoice because of what the future holds for us. Paul went on to say that we rejoice not only in the light of the future, but also in what the present offers: <i>“And not only in that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope”</i> (verses 3–4). Where verse 3 uses the word <i>“glory,”</i>  the original Greek word means “to rejoice, boast, or exult.” We should exult in tribulation because of what tribulation does. The <i>New American Standard Bible</i> says, <i>“Tribulation brings about perseverance; and perseverance, proven character; and proven character, hope.”</i>  Perseverance produces  <i>proven</i>  character in us. This is the heart of endurance—character that has stood the test. As Paul wrote, <i>“Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us”</i> (Romans 5:5).\nLove is a matter of character. In essence, we are dealing with the formation of our characters. We rejoice in tribulation, for tribulation is the only thing that produces perseverance. And perseverance produces proven character. I know men with whom I have walked and shared hardship, opposition, misrepresentation, and misunderstanding. But today, for me, their character is proven; I know I can trust them. In the midst of treachery and lawlessness, I want to know whom I can trust.',

        "body": 'One of the consistent themes of Hebrews is the danger of going back on your profession of faith in Christ. There are five distinct passages in Hebrews that warn us of the danger of going back. These are some of the most solemn words in Scripture. Therefore, one of the key words that Hebrews emphasizes is this word that we are looking at:  <i>endurance.</i>\n<i>And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope until the end, that you do not become sluggish, but imitate those who through faith and patience</i> <i> inherit the promises.</i> (Hebrews 6:11–12)\nFaith and endurance. Some people will tell you that faith is all you need to claim God’s promise. But that is not true. You need faith and endurance. It takes both. As the author of Hebrews continued, <i>“Therefore do not cast away your confidence, which has great reward. For you have need of endurance, so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise”</i> (Hebrews 10:35–36).\nThe word <i>confidence</i>  means that you have freedom of speech. You can talk boldly about Jesus—about what He has done for you and what He is will do for you. You have done the will of God, but you have not yet received the promises. What do you need? Endurance. You need to hold out from the point where you did God’s will and claimed the promise to the point where you actually receive the promise. Some people do the will of God and claim the promise, but they don’t hold out. Then, they say that it didn’t work. But it will not work without endurance. You need faith and endurance. ',

        "body": 'The tenth “Let us” step in the book of Hebrews is found near the end of chapter 12:\n<i>Therefore, since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us show gratitude, by which we may offer to God an acceptable service with reverence and awe; for our God is a consuming fire.</i> (Hebrews 12:28–29 nasb)\nWhere the version above says <i>“Let us show gratitude,”</i>  the King James and <i>New King James</i> Versions say, <i>“Let us have grace”</i> —and it is important that we understand the connection between grace and thanks.\nThe King James translation is a literal translation of the words—the phrase “to have grace” is commonly used in Greek to express the giving of thanks. This brings out the association between grace and thanks.\nThis connection is also found in various modern Romance languages.\nIn French, for instance, they say, “<i>Grâce</i> à Dieu,”  which means “Thanks to God”; in Italian, it is <i>“grazie,”</i>  and in Spanish, it is <i>“gracias.”</i>  All are taken from the same word for <i>grace</i>.\nIt is easy to see this connection between grace and thanks. In light of this fact, I want to tell you that you cannot have the grace of God in your life unless you practice giving thanks. Grace and thanks go together. There is nothing more ungracious than an unthankful person, whereas a thankful person will always experience the grace of God.\nGod requires two things of us as His people. First of all, He requires that we appreciate what He does for us. Second, He requires that we express our appreciation. It is important to understand our need to express appreciation to God.',
