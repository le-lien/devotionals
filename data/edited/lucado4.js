Because we cannot defend ourselves against the evil lion—the devil—who prowls around seeking some lost soul to devour. And because we sometimes lose our way in life. We need a Shepherd to care for us, to protect us, and to guide us. And we have one Jesus! He knows each of His sheep by name. He knows your  name.',
