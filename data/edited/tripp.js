        "body": 'I wish I could say that I am always content. I wish I could say that I never complain. I wish I could say that I never want what others have. I wish I could say that I have never envied the life of another. I wish I could say that I have never thought that God gave something to someone else that he meant for me. I wish I could say that I am better at counting my blessings than I am at assessing what I don’t have. I wish I could say that my appetite for things wasn’t so large. \n I wish my heart would finally be satisfied. These are all wishes because they are not yet completely true of me. Envy still lurks in my heart. It is one of the dark results of the sin that still resides there. \n Why does the Bible speak so strongly against envy? Here it is: when envy rules your heart, the love of God doesn’t. Let’s think about what envy does. It assumes that you deserve blessings that you don’t deserve. When your heart is ruled by envy, the attitude of “I am blessed” gets replaced with the attitude of “I deserve.” Envy is selfish to the core. Envy always puts you in the center of the world. It makes everything all about you. It causes you to examine life from the sole perspective of your wants, needs, and feelings.\nSadly, envy causes you to question the goodness, faithfulness, and wisdom of God. Envy accuses God of not knowing what he’s doing or of not being faithful to what he’s promised to do. When you are convinced that a blessing that another person has ought to belong to you, you don’t just have a problem with that person, you have a problem with God. When you begin to question God’s goodness, you quit going to him for help. Why? Because you don’t seek the help of someone you’ve come to doubt.\n Envy does something else that is spiritually deadly. It assumes understanding that no one has. Envy not only assumes that you know more about that other person’s life than you could ever know, it assumes that you have a clearer understanding of what is best than God does. Furthermore, envy causes you to forget God’s amazing rescuing, transforming, empowering, and delivering grace.\n You become so occupied with accounting for what you do not have that the enormous blessings of God’s grace—blessings that we could not have earned, achieved, or deserved—go unrecognized and uncelebrated. And because envy focuses more on what you want than it does on the life that God has called you to, it keeps you from paying attention to God’s commands and warnings, and therefore leaves you in moral danger. \nThe only solution to envy is God’s rescuing grace—grace that turns self-centered sinners into joyful and contented worshipers of God.',

        "body": 'The person next to you doesn’t need the gospel more than you do; he just needs it differently than you do. All people sin and fall short.\nThe indictment of Romans 3 puts us all in the same boat: What then? Are we Jews any better off? No, not at all. For we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin, as it is written:\n“None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands;no one seeks for God.\nAll have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one.”\n“Their throat is an open grave; they use their tongues to deceive.” \n“The venom of asps is under their lips.”\n“Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness.”\n“Their feet are swift to shed blood; in their paths are ruin and misery, and the way of peace they have not known.”\n“There is no fear of God before their eyes.” (Rom. 3:9–18) Yes, we are all sinners. We are all in the same desperate condition. None of us is better off than any other. None of us is more righteous. None of us is more deserving. None of us has anything to point to that would commend us to God. We all need to be rescued from the dark rebellion of our own hearts. There is only one hope for us all—the amazing, forgiving, rescuing, transforming, and delivering grace of Jesus. The problem is that we often don’t see it that way.\nPart of the blindness of sin is our tendency to be more irritated by and more concerned about the sin of the people next to us than our own. Because we are blind to our own sin and our eyes are open to theirs, we tend to see our neighbors as bigger sinners than we are. And when you fall into comparing yourself to another person, you almost always conclude that you are more righteous than he is, and when you conclude that you are more righteous than he is, you begin to minimize you own need for grace. In this way, false spiritual comparisons put you in spiritual danger. They make you think that you’re better off than you are and weaken your resolve to seek and celebrate redeeming grace. We must cry out for grace to deliver us from this tendency.\nYes, we all stand before God deserving of his anger. How grateful we ought to be that Christ bore our penalty so that we could bask in God’s grace.',

        "body": 'Your world is dramatically broken and you are still riddled with flaws, but Jesus is present, gracious, and faithful.\nYou and I have two big problems. First, we live in a dramatically broken world that does not function the way God intended. You will not live in this fallen world without suffering in some way. Perhaps it will be a situation of heartbreaking injustice. Maybe you’ll be the victim of an act of violence. Perhaps you’ll suffer a divorce or the betrayal of a friend. Maybe you’ll be robbed or mugged. Perhaps, like many, you’ll suffer under the weight of corrupt government. Maybe a disease will infect and weaken your body. But even if none of these things comes your way, you’ll suffer the hardship and toil of living in a world where things simply don’t work in the way that God designed. But that’s not all. You’ll also be required to deal with the endless temptations that wait for you around every corner. What God says is ugly will be presented to you as beautiful. Seductive voices will whisper untruths in your ears. You’ll be tempted to desire things that are outside God’s plan for you. If you don’t take the fallenness of your world seriously, you’ll live with unrealistic expectations and be naive to temptation.\nBut we have a second and even more fundamental problem. It is far more troublesome than the evil that is outside us. It’s the evil inside us. If you’re God’s child, the power of sin has been broken in God’s justifying grace, but the presence of sin still remains and is being progressively eradicated by sanctifying grace. This means sin still lives inside you. Your trouble is never just environmental, it is always also internal. If you were completely pure in heart, life in this fallen world would be infinitely easier. But if you embrace the theology of the heart that is in Scripture, you know that sin is first a heart problem before it is ever a behavior problem.\nHere’s what you and I need to understand and never forget: it is only ever the evil inside us that hooks us to the evil outside us. Sin makes me susceptible to the lure of temptation. Temptation plays to the evil desires and idolatrous cravings that still live in my heart. Temptation appeals to my selfishness and greed. Temptation targets my laziness and impatience. Temptation hooks my materialism and discontent. Temptation goes after my desire to have my own way and write my own rules.\nBut in his grace, Jesus is present to help us overcome both of these problems:\n“Where sin increased, grace abounded all the more” (Rom. 5:20). Isn’t it good to know that “as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord” (v. 21)?',

        "body": 'You were created to be dependent. God welcomes your dependency with his grace, so why would you want to go it on your own?\nWrapped into the devious temptation of the Serpent in the garden were two foundational lies. These lies have been believed somehow, some way by every person who has ever lived. If you’re a parent, you’ve seen the acceptance of them in your children from a very early age.\nThe first lie is the lie of autonomy. This lie tells you that you are an independent human, that your life belongs to you, and that you have the right to live your life as you please. It is an attractive and seductive lie. Believing this lie makes a little child protest when he’s told to go to bed or to eat his peas.\nHowever, the doctrine of creation destroys the lie of autonomy. Think with me.\nCreation depicts ownership. I am a painter by avocation. Once I have composed, painted, and completed a painting, it belongs to me because I made it. You can buy it from me or I can gift it to you, but until I relinquish it, it is mine because I created it. Since God created you and me, we belong to him. We don’t own our mentality, our spirituality, our emotionality, our psychology, our personality, or our physicality. We are not independent beings and we do not have a natural right to do with our physical and spiritual selves whatever we desire to do.Autonomy is a life-destroying lie.\nThe second lie is the lie of self-sufficiency.  This lie tells you that you have everything within yourself to be what you’re supposed to be and to do what you’re supposed to do. This lie explains why a little child struggling to tie his shoelaces will slap his mom’s hand away when she tries to help, even though he has no idea how to make a bow. However, the doctrine of creation destroys this lie as well. Creation depicts dependency. The flower you plant in your garden is not self-sufficient. If it is not weeded and not watered, it will not grow. You and I were created to be dependent, first on God and second on others in interdependent relationships. Immediately after creating Adam and Eve, God began to talk to them because he knew they had no capacity to figure life out on their own. The lie of self-sufficiency is also life-destroying because it causes us to resist the help of our Creator—the very help we were designed to need and he is willing to give.\nGoing it on your own simply does not work. The self-made man is always poorly made. Here is an argument for how much we need grace. It takes an act of grace to release us from our bondage to these lies so that we will confess our need for grace and then seek the grace that is our only hope in life and death. It really does take grace to know how much you need grace. ',

It separates us from the rest of creation.\nIt causes us much anxiety and much joy. It shapes the decisions and investments that we make. It calms our fears or leaves us scared and feeling alone. It turns all of us into theologians and philosophers. Where we land in this pursuit shapes the way we look at life and interpret the things that happen to us. It proves that we don’t live by instinct or by impersonal determinative forces. It exposes the fact that we are deeply spiritual beings. It is one of our most foundational quests. As different as we are one from another, in this way we are all the same. We all are looking for something in which to place our hope. We’re all in search of security.\nI don’t know if you’ve thought about this, but there are only two places to look for hope. You can search for it horizontally, thinking that something in creation will give you the security, peace, and inner sense of well-being that you seek, or you can seek it vertically, entrusting your life into the loving hands of your Creator. People put their hope in the creation all the time. They seek satisfaction of heart in the love of other human beings or in the success of their careers. They think their hearts will be satisfied by a certain set of achievements or by a certain catalog of possessions. But none of these things has the power to satisfy your heart. They are all meant to point you to the one place where you heart will find secure rest. You and I need to face this reality—creation will never be our savior!\nSo where is hope to be found, hope that will never disappoint or shame you?\nIt really is found in three of the most glorious words ever penned in human language. These words have the power to transform you and everything about you. These words can end your frantic search and give your weary heart rest.\nThese words describe the One who alone is capable of carrying your hope: “God is love” (1 John 4:16). Because he is love and because he has placed his love on you, you have security and hope even in those scary moments when it feels as if you have neither. The One who is love sent his Son of love to be a sacrifice of love so you and I could be rescued by his love and rest in that love forever and ever.',

It doesn’t find its way into our theological outlines.\nIt’s not the typical way we think about our Redeemer. Yet it is an observation that not only gives you hope, but defines for you what your Lord is doing right here, right now. Here it is—you serve a dissatisfied Redeemer. You ought to be very thankful that your Lord isn’t easily satisfied. He does not do his work poorly or incompletely. He does not walk away from what he has begun until it is perfectly finished. He does not grow bored, tired, discouraged, or distracted.\nHe does not have a short attention span. He does not suffer from redemptive attention deficit disorder. He never grows impatient. He isn’t irritated by how long his work is taking. He never wishes that he hadn’t begun in the first place.\nHe never tries to rush what takes time. He never uses his power to turn what must be a process into an event. He never wonders if it’s worth it and contemplates calling it all off.\nYour Redeemer is zealous for one goal—the final renewal of all things.\nUltimate salvation from all that sin is and all that sin has broken is his unrelenting pursuit. He will continue to unleash his power to accomplish redemption and he will not be satisfied until the last enemy is under his feet and the final kingdom has come. Yes, there is great and eternal hope for you in the dissatisfaction of your Redeemer.\nOur problem is that we are all too easily satisfied. We’re satisfied with a little bit of theological knowledge, a degree of biblical literacy, occasional moments of ministry, and a measure of personal spiritual growth. We’re sadly satisfied with being a little bit better when God’s goal is that we be completely remolded into his image. In fact, it is even worse than that. Not only are we too easily satisfied, willing to stop before the Redeemer’s work is fully accomplished in us, we are all very easily distracted. We get distracted by the temporary glories of the created world, and we actually begin to think that we can find our satisfaction there. So we quit pressing on because our Redeemer is pressing on. While he, in glorious dissatisfaction, still works to redeem us from us, we are out chasing other lovers. We begin to believe that they can do for us what he alone can do. We begin to invest our time, energy, and hope in things that can never deliver.\nHope is not found in the places where our hearts look for satisfaction, but in the dissatisfaction of our Redeemer. He will complete his work even in those moments when we don’t care that he does.',

        "body": 'Corporate worship is a regular, gracious reminder that it’s not about you.\nYou’ve been born into a life that is a celebration of another.\nCorporate worship is a celebration that serves as a very important reminder for us all. We gather together to celebrate the One who created, controls, and sits at the center of all things. Every biblical worship service is guided and shaped by the words of Romans 11:33–36:\nOh, the depths of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!\n“For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor?” \n“Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid?”\nFor from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen.\nThe final verse says it all. It is not only a prescription for every worship service, but also a powerful statement about what life is all about. Life is not about us. It is not about our wants, our needs, or our feelings. It is not about our comfort, pleasure, and ease. It is not about us getting our personal definition of happiness. It’s not about our satisfaction and contentment. It’s not about how many of our dreams we actually get to experience. It’s not about our successes and achievements. It’s not about how successfully we avoid difficulty and suffering. It’s not about how well our relationships are working.\nIt’s not wrong to desire personal happiness, peace, a healthy body, and healthy relationships. The issue is this—these things must not rule our hearts, because when they do, they place us at the center of our world and make it all about us. It is sad that many people, even professing Christians, live in a way that is God-forgetting and God-replacing. We put ourselves in the center, we decide for ourselves what we want life to be like, and we reduce God to little more than the delivery system for our catalog of self-oriented dreams.\nSo corporate worship calls us back again and again to remember and to celebrate. It calls us to remember that all that exists, including us, is from God, exists through him, and points to him. He is the beginning, the center, and the end of all things. His will is preeminent and will be done. His kingdom will come. Grace decimates our lordship and causes us to bow to the one true Lord. It is only by grace that we celebrate a lordship other than our own. Corporate worship points us to our need for and the availability of that grace.',

It is a theme that cannot be repeated too much. It is a practical concern that touches everything that we think, desire, say, and do. It reaches to the deepest levels of human motivation. It sits at the epicenter of our spiritual struggles. It is one of the underlying causes of the most important battles of the heart. It exposes the deepest wishes of our souls. It is at the heart of why we were created. It expresses God’s will for everyone who has ever taken a breath. It is the great moral dividing line.

Submission and rebellion are all about glory. Love and hatred are all about glory. A life of demand and a life of service are both propelled by glory. Contentment and craving are both motivated by glory. Every word you speak and every action you take is directed by glory. Glory causes you to want some things and despise others. Glory makes you arrogant and causes you to be humble. Glory reduces you to a thief or motivates you to give. Glory makes your heart glad or causes it to be eaten with envy. Glory makes you constantly thankful for a Savior or causes you to forget he exists.\n\nWe human beings were hardwired for glory. Glory orientation was woven into the fabric of our hearts. We were designed this way so that we would be able to take in all the glories of creation and so that those glories would point us to the one glory that is truly glorious and alone able to satisfy our hearts, the glory of God. This means that we are always living in pursuit of some kind of glory. Either our hearts have been captured by the temporary glories of the created world or by grace they have been captured by the eternally satisfying glory of God. We are working for our own glory, pursuing some created glory, or living for God’s glory. But we are always living for glory. \n\nJesus came to liberate us from our addiction to glories that will never satisfy our hearts. He came to free us from our bondage to our own glory and our obsession with the shadow glories of the created world. He willingly died for glory thieves (us) so that we would find our satisfaction in and live in service of the glory of God. Jesus not only revealed God’s glory on earth; he died so that that glory would be the final resting place of our hearts.',

Live as his disciple; he’s got your true needs covered.\nWe place many things in our “I just can’t live without” category, but the reality is that many of them are not things we actually require for life. These things may be wonderful to enjoy and sweet blessings from a tender and loving Father, but they are not needs and must not be named as such. When we call them needs, we tell ourselves that we have to have them, that we cannot live without them, and that we have a right to demand them. So we end up evaluating the love of God on the basis of how many of the things that we have christened as needs he has delivered to us. As we do this, our lives get shaped by a needs focus, and we spend so much time thinking about and working toward acquiring our needs that we have little personal time left for the larger pursuits of the kingdom of God.\nBecause of this, Philippians 4:10–20 is very instructive for us: I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length you have revived your concern for me. You were indeed concerned for me, but you had no opportunity. Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content. I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need. I can do all things through him who strengthens me.\nYet it was kind of you to share my trouble. And you Philippians yourselves know that in the beginning of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church entered into partnership with me in giving and receiving, except you only. Even in Thessalonica you sent me help for my needs once and again.\nNot that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that increases to your credit. I have received full payment, and more. I am well supplied, having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God. And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus. To our God and Father be glory forever and ever.Amen.\nYou quit worrying about your catalog of “I must haves” and therefore are freed to give yourself to the work of God’s kingdom when: 1. you are convinced that God will give you the strength you need to face whatever he has ordained you to face (“I can do all things through him who strengthens me”) and 2. you really do believe that God is actively committed to meeting every one of your true needs (“And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus”). \nWhen grace causes your heart to rest in these truths, you no longer live a need-obsessed life and are free to give yourself to the worship and service of God.',

The heart-convicting ministry of the Holy Spirit.\nI love the hymn, “Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing.” I especially appreciate the honest admission and plea of the third verse:\nO to grace how great a debtor\ndaily I’m constrained to be!\nLet thy goodness, like a fetter, bind my wandering heart to thee.\nProne to wander, Lord, I feel it, prone to leave the God I love; here’s my heart, O take and seal it, seal it for thy courts above.\nHere is an honest, excuse-free expression of the spiritual struggle we experience between the grace of conversion and the grace of eternity. It is what we all deal with every day. It’s what causes us to lose our way. It’s what leads us to live in a way that is contradictory to what we profess to believe. It’s what makes us susceptible to temptation. We are all still in possession of wandering hearts. We would like to think that our hearts are perfectly faithful and true, but they are not. We would like to think that nothing could lure us away from our loyalty to our Lord. We would like to think that our moral commitments are unshakable. We would like to think that what God says is wrong would not be attractive to us. We would like to think that we always think God’s thoughts after him and that our desires are always in the right place. We would like to think all of these things. But the problem is that we still have fickle hearts.\nYou see, our biggest problem is not that we live with flawed people who bring trouble our way. Our great difficulty is not that we live in a fallen world where temptation tends to greet us around every corner. The big issue for us is not that we live in a world that isn’t operating the way God intended, as a result of which we face difficulty, disease, suffering, loss, and grief. No, our big difficulty is that sin still resides in our hearts. It still distorts our thoughts and redirects our desires. The less-than-perfect people, the temptations around us, and the broken world in which we live are problems for us because we have this problem in our hearts. It is humbling, but it is important to remember that it is only ever the sin inside us that hooks us to the sin outside of us. So what we need most is not a change of location or relationship, but a fundamental rescue of heart, and that is exactly what God’s grace in the person of the Holy Spirit provides for us.',

        "body": 'No one knows you more deeply and fully than your Savior, so no one offers you help formfitted for your deepest needs like he does.\nIt is one of the most comforting passages in all of the New Testament. It is one that you and I should meditate on again and again:\nSince then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. (Heb. 4:14–16)\nThis passage is a call to live with hope, encouragement, courage, and confidence. Why? Not only because you have a High Priest who has passed through the heavens and now sits at the right hand of the Father on high, but also because he is sympathetic to your weaknesses. But there is more. He is sympathetic to your weaknesses because he hears and answers you from the vantage point of an experiential basis of knowledge of exactly what you are going through. He came to earth and, from the time he was an infant until he ascended after his resurrection, he faced the full range of the sufferings and temptations that we face. He knows what it is like to be homeless, hungry, and rejected. He is acquainted with disease and physical pain. He knows the power of accusation and injustice. He faced the siren voice of temptation. He knows what it is like to be forsaken by loved ones. He understands suffering and death.\nHe stared evil in the face. He knows us and has a firsthand understanding of what we deal with day in and day out.\nThe word translated as “weaknesses” in this passage is profound. It’s almost untranslatable. It is used in many ways. It’s probably best understood as “the human condition.” Our High Priest understands what it is like to be a human being in this fallen world because, in an act of shocking, condescending love, he took on human flesh and lived with us as a man. Now, as the resurrected and ascended man, he sits next to the Father as our High Priest. This means that our struggles and prayers are not greeted with harshness, condemnation, or impatience, but with understanding and sympathy.\nAll of this means that we can rest assured that we will receive from his hand mercy that is formfitted for the particular needs in which we find ourselves. We can be confident that he hears us with the sympathy of shared experience and, because he does, he will provide for us exactly what we need. Now, that’s amazing grace!',

        "body": ' If Christ is your life, you are free from the desperate quest to find life in situations, locations, and relationships.\nIt is a wonderful freedom that we just don’t think about and discuss enough. It liberates you from the stress, fear, and anxiety that so many people live with every day. It is a sweet gift of grace that is given to you right here, right now.\nYou never could have found it on your own. You never could have earned or achieved it. You still can’t stand before God and say that you deserve it. It is a gift that is not to be ignored or misunderstood.\nYou have been given Christ, and in being given Christ, you have been given life. You don’t need to search for meaning and purpose. You don’t need to search for identity. You don’t need to look for something to give you the inner sense of well-being that every person wants. You don’t have to wonder if you’ll ever be loved. You don’t have to worry that your life and work will result in nothing. You don’t have to wonder if you’ll have what you need to face what will be on your plate today. You don’t have to worry about your future. You will never be left to the limited range of your own resources. You will never, ever be left alone. There is always someone who understands you and offers you the help that you need. You don’t have to worry about whether your wrongs will be forgiven and your weaknesses greeted with patience and grace. You don’t have to worry, because you have a Savior who has invaded your life with his grace and has made you the place where he dwells.\nSo you have been freed from the endless quest for life that consumes so many people. So many look for life where it cannot be found. They hope their marriages will give them the happiness they have not yet found. They look to their jobs to give them identity. They look to people and possessions to give them peace. They don’t know it, but they are asking the situations, locations, and relationships of everyday life to be their saviors. Sadly, they’re drinking from wells that are dry and eating bread that will never satisfy. The situations, locations, and relationships of daily life are wonderful to enjoy, but we must understand that they will never, ever satisfy our hearts. For that, we have been given a true Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.\nSo instead of wasting time on that endless quest for life, you have been invited to enter into God’s rest for the rest of your life. Rest in your identity as his child. Rest in his eternal love. Rest in his powerful grace. Rest in his constant presence and faithful provision. Rest in his patience and forgiveness. Rest.',

        "body": 'God harnessed the forces of nature and controlled the events of history to redeem you. Will he abandon you now in your moment of need?\nThe Bible isn’t a series of stories. It isn’t a catalog of interesting characters. It isn’t a manual of theology. It isn’t a book of interesting wisdom principles. One story, with one hero, forms the cord that holds the whole Bible together. The Bible is essentially the story of redemption. This grand redemptive story, with God’s essential explanatory notes, is the main content of the Word of God.\nThe Bible displays for us the extent to which God has gone in order to provide salvation for us. He really controlled every event in human history, and he really harnessed the forces of nature so that at a certain time his Son would come and live, suffer, die, and rise again to provide salvation for us. It is a stunning story that should provide the interpretive grid for everything you face in your life in this broken world.\nIf God went to such lengths as to control the events of the world and to sacrifice his one and only Son, would it make any sense at all for him to abandon you between the “already” of your justification and the “not yet” of your final glorification? Would it make any sense for him to turn his back on you now?\nWould it make any sense for him to ignore you in your hour of need? Would you expend a great amount of personal effort and sacrifice to secure something of value and then not work to keep, maintain, and protect it?\nThe fact that you are precious in God’s sight is clear because he purchased you at a great price. No higher price could be paid than the death of the Messiah.\nBut that’s exactly the price that God paid to redeem you and me. Since he paid such a price, we can rest assured he will expend his divine power and grace to protect, mature, provide for, and keep us until we are with him in a place where the dangers of sin and death are no more. Paul says it this way: “If he freely gave us Jesus, doesn’t it make sense that he will also give us everything that we need?” (see Rom. 8:31–33).\nSo don’t let any evil enemy whisper lies into your ear. Don’t let him tell you that you are alone, that you’re left to your own resources, or that God doesn’t hear or care. Don’t let yourself doubt God’s presence and his goodness. Don’t let yourself wonder if you’ll make it through. God unleashed his power to make you his own, and he will continue to unleash his power to keep and protect you until you are with him forever in that place where you will need his protection no more because the final enemy will be under his feet.',

        "body": 'It is a grace to be willing to listen to and consider criticism. It takes grace to quiet the mind and settle the heart to hear.\nWe are not naturally open to criticism. Most of us don’t like to be confronted. It is natural for us to rise to our own defenses when we are questioned. It is natural for us to work to convince ourselves and others that we are righteous. When questioned, it is natural for us to get out our catalogs of righteousness as evidence to convince others that they must have misjudged or misunderstood us.\nIt is natural for us to be more focused on and concerned about the sin of others than our own. It is natural for us to confront others with things that we excuse in ourselves. It is natural for us to see our wrongs as less than wrong. It is natural for us to swindle ourselves into believing that we are far more righteous than we really are. For sinners, self-righteousness is more natural than humility.\nIn short, it is more natural for us to have hard hearts that are resistant to change than hearts that are open, humble, and crying out for change. So if you are open to loving confrontation, if you are ready to admit your sin, if you are thankful for those who have loved you enough to help you see what you would not see on your own, and if you are ready to confess and seek forgiveness, you know that you have been visited by the grace of Jesus, because none of these attitudes is natural for us apart from divine intervention.\nIt takes powerful redeeming grace to remove the hearts of stone from us and replace them with hearts of flesh—hearts that are sensitive to sin, sensitive to the grace of conviction, sensitive to the need for change, and resting in the forgiveness that is found only in Jesus. It takes grace that guarantees that the blood of Jesus has covered everything about us that could ever be known or exposed to give us the courage to look at ourselves in the searching mirror of the Word of God. It takes grace for us to let go of excuses, rationalizations, self-atoning arguments, and our tendency to shift the blame to others. It takes grace for us to be able to stand as sinners before a holy God and admit that there are ways in which we are still rebels against his lordship and his commands.\nConfession is not intuitive for sinners. Humility is not our natural first response. Love of God more than love of self is not a first instinct. The glory of God isn’t naturally the core motivator of what we do and say. So if you are willing to say, “God, show me my heart,” and willing to speak these words, “Please forgive me,” you know that you have been showered with amazing grace —grace that has already changed your heart and grace that promises more change to come.',
