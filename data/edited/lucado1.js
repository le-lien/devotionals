They have no natural defense—no claws, no horns, no fangs. They are helpless. Sheep need a shepherd with a “rod and … walking stick” (Ps. 23:4) to protect them. They have no sense of direction. They need someone to lead them “on paths that are right” (Ps. 23:3).\nSo do we. We, too, tend to be swept away by waters we should have avoided. We have no defense against the evil lion who prowls about seeking whom he might devour. We, too, get lost.\nWe need a shepherd. We need a shepherd to care for us and to guide us.\nAnd we have one. One who knows us by name.',

He went to the cage to feed the bird and noticed for the first time that the parakeet had only one leg.\nHe felt cheated that he’d been sold a one-legged bird, so he called and complained.\n“What do you want,” the store owner responded, “a bird who can sing or a bird who can dance?”\nGood question for times of disappointment.',
