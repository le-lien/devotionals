Your boat is where you spend your day, make your living, and to a large degree live your life.\nThe taxi you drive, … the dental office you manage, the family you feed and transport—this is your boat. Christ shoulder-taps us and reminds:\n“You drive my truck.”\n“You work on my job site.”\n“You serve my hospital wing.”\nTo us all, Jesus says, “Your work is my work.” ',

Death on a cross was usually reserved for the most vile offenders: slaves, murderers, assassins, and the like. The condemned person was marched through the city streets, shouldering his crossbar and wearing a placard about his neck that named his crime. At the execution site he was stripped and mocked.\nCrucifixion was so abhorrent that Cicero wrote, “Let the very name of the cross be far away, not only from the body of a Roman citizen, but even from his thoughts, his eyes, his ears.”\nJesus was not only shamed before people, he was shamed before heaven.\nSince he bore the sin of the murderer and adulterer, he felt the shame of the murderer and adulterer. Though he never lied, he bore the disgrace of a liar. Though he never cheated, he felt the embarrassment of a cheater. Since he bore the sin of the world, he felt the collective shame of the world.

Perhaps underlined Bible passages regarding it. But have you received it?\nThe proof is in your patience. Patience deeply received results in patience freely offered… .\nGod does more than demand patience from us; he offers it to us. Patience is a fruit of his Spirit. It hangs from the tree of Galatians 5:22: “The Spirit produces the fruit of love, joy, peace, patience.” Have you asked God to give you some fruit? Well I did once, but … But what? Did you, h’m, grow impatient? Ask him again and again and again. He won’t grow impatient with your pleading, and you will receive patience in your praying. ',

One of the men gestured widely and his arm struck the serving maid’s tea tray, sending the teapot flying into the whitewashed wall.\nThe innkeeper surveyed the damage and sighed, “The whole wall will have to be repainted.”\n“Perhaps not,” offered a stranger. “Let me work with it.”\nHaving nothing to lose, the proprietor consented. The man pulled pencils, brushes, and pigment out of an art box. . . . In time, an image began to emerge: a stag with a great rack of antlers. The man inscribed his signature at the bottom, paid for his meal, and left. His name: Sir Edwin Landseer, famous painter of wildlife.\nIn his hands, a mistake became a masterpiece. God’s hands do the same, over and over. He draws together the disjointed blotches in our life and renders them an expression of his love. ',

Though eulogized by Paul for his faith, this Father of a Nation wasn’t without his weaknesses. He had a fibbing tongue that wouldn’t stop! One time, in order to save his neck, he let the word get out that Sarah wasn’t his wife but his sister, which was only half true. And then, not long later, he did it again! “And there Abraham said of his wife Sarah, ‘She is my sister.’”\nTwice he traded in his integrity for security. That’s what you call confidence in God’s promises? Can you build a nation on that kind of faith?\nGod can. God took what was good and forgave what was bad and used “old forked tongue” to start a nation. ',

It figuratively means “taking a long time to boil.” Think about a pot of boiling water. What factors determine the speed at which it boils? The size of the stove? No. The pot? The utensil may have an influence, but the primary factor is the intensity of the flame. Water boils quickly when the flame is high. It boils slowly when the flame is low. Patience “keeps the burner down.”\nHelpful clarification, don’t you think? Patience isn’t naive. It doesn’t ignore misbehavior. It just keeps the flame low. It waits. It listens. It’s slow to boil.

To consider others better than yourself, then, is not to say you have no place; it is to say that you know your place. “Don’t cherish exaggerated ideas of yourself or your importance, but try to have a sane estimate of your capabilities by the light of the faith that God has given to you” (Rom. 12:3\nPHILLIPS).

The contents of this tomb belong to Rome.” Their seal, of course, proved futile.\nThe seal of the Spirit, however, proves forceful. When you accepted Christ, God sealed you with the Spirit. “Having believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit.” When hell’s interlopers come seeking to snatch you from God, the seal turns them away.

The hurricane that wrecks the coast, the rain that nourishes the desert, the infant’s first heartbeat, the elderly person’s final breath— all can be traced back to the hand of Christ, the firstborn of creation.\nFirstborn in Paul’s vernacular has nothing to do with birth order.\nFirstborn refers to order of rank. As one translation states: “He ranks higher than everything that has been made” (v.15 NCV). Everything? Find an exception. Peter’s mother-in-law has a fever; Jesus rebukes it. A tax needs to be paid; Jesus pays it by sending first a coin and then a fisherman’s hook into the mouth of a fish. Jesus … bats an eyelash, and nature jumps. ',

Not, “your prophets,” “your teachers,” or “your counselors.”\nYour second step is to assume the right posture.

Peter urges us to “be humble under God’s powerful hand so he will lift you up when the right time comes” (1 Pet.\n5:6).\nWhen we come to God, we make requests; we don’t make demands. We come with high hopes and a humble heart. We state what we want, but we pray for what is right.\nWe go to him. We bow before him, and we trust in him. ',

He watched two goats traversing a narrow path from opposite directions, one ascending, the other descending. At one point the narrow trail prevented them from passing each other. When they saw each other, they backed up and lowered their heads, as though ready to lunge. But then a wonderful thing happened.\nThe ascending goat lay down on the path. The other stepped over his back.\nThe first animal then arose and continued his climb to the top. Zwingli observed that the goat made it higher because he was willing to bend lower.\nDidn’t the same happen to Jesus? “God made his name greater than every other name so that every knee will bow to the name of Jesus.” ',

Heaven enjoys a maternity-ward reaction to funerals. Angels watch body burials the same way grandparents monitor delivery-room doors. “He’ll be coming through any minute!” They can’t wait to see the new arrival. While we’re driving hearses and wearing black, they’re hanging pink and blue streamers and passing out cigars. We don’t grieve when babies enter the world. The hosts of heaven don’t weep when we leave it. ',

    "body": 'Look at the first word: surely. David didn’t say, “<i>Maybe</i> goodness and mercy shall follow me.” Or “<i>Possibly</i> goodness and mercy shall follow me.” Or “I <i>have a hunch</i> that goodness and mercy shall follow me.” David could have used one of those phrases. But he didn’t. He believed in a sure God, who makes sure promises and provides a sure foundation. David would have loved the words of one of his great-great-grandsons, the apostle James. He described God as the one “with whom there is never the slightest variation or shadow of inconsistency” (James 1:17 PHILLIPS).\nOur moods may shift, but God’s doesn’t. Our minds may change, but God’s doesn’t. Our devotion may falter, but God’s never does. Even if we are faithless, he is faithful, for he cannot betray himself (2 Tim. 2:13). He is a sure God.',
