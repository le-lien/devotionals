    "body": 'ay the Lord help us to understand His word. I see the truth as it was brought to the Israelites in the law. Paul M had something to glory in when he kept the law and was blameless, but he said he threw that to one side to win Him who is even greater than that (Phil. 3:8).\n\nNow we come to the question: what is in the law that isn‘t glorious? Nothing. It was so glorious that Moses was filled with joy in the expectation of what it was. But what is ours in the excellence of glory? It is this: we live, we move, we reign over all things. It is not "Do, do, do"; it is "Will, will, will." I rejoice to do. It is no longer "Thou shalt not"; it is "I will." “I delight to do Your will, O my God”  (Ps. 40:8). So the glory is far exceeding. And, beloved, in our hearts there is exceeding glory. Oh, the joy of this celestial touch!\n\nOh yes, the glory is exceeding. The glory is excellent. When Peter was describing that wonderful day on the Mount of Transfiguration, he said, “Such a voice came to Him [Christ] from the Excellent Glory”  (2 Pet. 1:17). And so we are hearing from the Excellent Glory. It is so lovely.\n\nIf I were to say to you, "Whatever you do, you must try to exercise self-control in order to be holy," I would miss it. I would be altogether outside of His plan. But by the Holy Spirit, I take the words of the epistle that says, “Be holy”  (1 Pet. 1:16). For when you lose your heart and Another takes your heart, and you lose your desires and He takes the desires, then you live in that sunshine of bliss that no mortal can ever touch.\n\nDivine immortality swallows up all natural mortality. It is lovely to walk in the Spirit; then we will not fulfill any part of the law without the Spirit causing us to dwell in safety, rejoice inwardly, praise God reverently, and know that we are an increasing force of immortality swallowing up life. Hallelujah!',
