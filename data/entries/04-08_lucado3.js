Those who talk about their need for respect sound like people with a head bigger than their hat size.\nTheir efforts to boost their standing come off as empty bragging.\nThe French philosopher Blaise Pascal asked, “Do you wish people to speak well of you? Then never speak well of yourself.” Maybe that’s why the Bible says, “Don’t praise yourself. Let someone else do it.”\nDo you feel a need for affirmation? Does your self-esteem need attention? You don’t need to drop names or show off. You need only pause at the base of the cross and be reminded of this: the maker of the stars would rather die for you than live without you. And that is a fact. So if you need to brag, brag about that.\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
