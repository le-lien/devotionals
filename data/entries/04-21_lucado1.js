Apparently, Jesus did.\nHe made a deliberate effort to spend time with God.\nSpend much time reading about the listening life of Jesus and a distinct pattern emerges. He spent regular time with God, praying and listening.\nMark says, “Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed” (Mark 1:35\nNIV)… .\nLet me ask the obvious. If Jesus, the Son of God, the sinless Savior of humankind, thought it worthwhile to clear his calendar to pray, wouldn’t we be wise to do the same? ',
