You can’t fall if you don’t take a stand, right?\nYou can’t lose your balance if you never climb, right? So don’t try it. Take the safe route.\nOr you can hear the voice of adventure—God’s adventure. Instead of building a fire in your hearth, build a fire in your heart. Follow God’s impulses. Adopt the child. Move overseas. Teach the class. Change careers.\nRun for office. Make a difference. Sure it isn’t safe, but what is? ',
