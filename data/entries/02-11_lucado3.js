But one of the sweetest reasons God saves you is because he is fond of you. He likes having you around. He thinks you are the hottest song he’s seen on the charts in quite a while.\nWhen you’re crazy about another guy or gal, what do you do? You think about him all the time. Your heart skips a beat when you get a text from her.\nYou can’t wait to see him next. That’s how God feels about you. If he had a refrigerator, your picture would be on it. If he had a wallet, your photo would be in it. He sends you flowers every spring and a sunrise every morning.\nWhenever you want to talk, he’ll listen. He can live anywhere in the universe, and he chose your heart.\nFace it, friend. He’s crazy about you.\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
