Nothing but smoke and mirrors and tin-drum thunder. Is that the kind of god you need?\nYou don’t need to carry the burden of a lesser god … a god on a shelf, a god in a box, or a god in a bottle. No, you need a God who can place 100\nbillion stars in our galaxy and 100 billion galaxies in the universe. You need a God who can shape two fists of flesh into 75 to 100 billion nerve cells, each with as many as 10,000 connections to other nerve cells, place it in a skull, and call it a brain.\nAnd you need a God who, while so mind-numbingly mighty, can come in the soft of night and touch you with the tenderness of an April snow.
