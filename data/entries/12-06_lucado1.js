Look how he defined his family: “My true brother and sister and mother are those who do what God wants” (Mark 3:35).\nWhen Jesus’ brother didn’t share his convictions, he didn’t try to force them. He recognized that his spiritual family could provide what his physical family didn’t...\nWe can’t control the way our family responds to us. When it comes to the behavior of others toward us, our hands are tied. We have to move beyond the naive expectation that if we do good, people will treat us right. The fact is they may and they may not—we cannot control how people respond to us...\nLet God give you what your family doesn’t. If your earthly father doesn’t affirm you, then let your heavenly Father take his place...\n[And] don’t lose heart. God still changes families.',
