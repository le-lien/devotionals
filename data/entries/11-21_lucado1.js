    "body": 'One translation renders Hebrews 11:6: “God … rewards those who earnestly seek him” (NIV). I like the King James translation: “He is a rewarder of them that diligently  seek him” (italics mine).\nDiligently—what a great word. Be diligent in your search. Be hungry in your quest, relentless in your pilgrimage. Let this book be but one of dozens you read about Jesus… . Step away from the puny pursuits of possessions and positions, and seek your king.\nDon’t be satisfied with angels. Don’t be content with stars in the sky.\nSeek him out as the shepherds did. Long for him as Simeon did. Worship him as the wise men did. Do as John and Andrew did: ask for his address.\nDo as Matthew: invite Jesus into your house. Imitate Zacchaeus. Risk whatever it takes to see Christ. ',
