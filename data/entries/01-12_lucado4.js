    "body": 'Martha was a dear friend of Jesus. But the Bible tells us about a time when she was worried. She was having Jesus over for dinner. She was really  going to be serving God! She wanted everything to be just right for Jesus. But she made one very big mistake. She was working so hard for Jesus that she let her work become more important than her Lord.\nYou see, Martha wanted Jesus to praise her  for all her work. She forgot that she was supposed to be praising <i>Him</i>  with her work. She forgot that the meal was to honor Jesus. What began as a way to serve Jesus turned into a way to serve herself.\nIt is important to serve Jesus. But don’t serve Him just so that others will see you. Don’t serve Him so that others will be pleased with you or say nice things about you. Remember—you are the servant, and He is the One to be served.',
