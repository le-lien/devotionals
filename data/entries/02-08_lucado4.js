So did He. Do people seem to want you to do more and more? Jesus understands.\nHave your feelings been hurt? Are you ever sad or frightened? Jesus knows all about that. Does it sometimes seem that even your family isn’t paying attention to you? That your friends have turned against you? Jesus knows how you feel.\nYou are precious to Him. So precious that He became a human just like you so that you would come to Him. ',

But even before you talk to them, talk to Jesus. He’s faced that problem before too. And He, too, can show you answers you hadn’t thought of.'
