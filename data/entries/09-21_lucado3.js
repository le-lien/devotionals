There is nothing unique about this ball. For all I know it was bought at a discount sports store. What makes it unique is the signatures.\nThe same is true with us. When you just look at all of nature, humans are not entirely unique. We aren’t the only creatures with flesh and hair and blood and hearts. What makes us special is not only our body but the signature of God on our lives. We are his works of art. We are created in his image to do good deeds. We are significant, not because of what we do, but because of whose we are.\nGod has put his autograph on you. That makes you valuable beyond measure.\nONE MORE THOUGHT\nA signature means everything to collectors. A baseball signed by Babe Ruth? ',
