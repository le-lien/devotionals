    "body": 'The word holy  means “to separate.” The ancestry of the term can be traced back to an ancient word which means “to cut.” To be holy, then, is to be a cut above the norm, superior, extraordinary… . The Holy One dwells on a different level from the rest of us. What frightens us does not frighten him. What troubles us does not trouble him.\nI’m more a landlubber than a sailor, but I’ve puttered around in a bass boat enough to know the secret for finding land in a storm… . You don’t aim at another boat. You certainly don’t stare at the waves. You set your sights on an object unaffected by the wind—a light on the shore—and go straight toward it… .\nWhen you set your sights on our God, you focus on one “a cut above”\nany storm life may bring… . You find peace. ',
