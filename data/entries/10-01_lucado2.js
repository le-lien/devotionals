    "body": 'Maybe you’ve gone through the acts of religion and faith and yet found yourself more often than not at a dry well. Prayers seem empty. Goals seem unthinkable. Christianity becomes a warped record full of highs and lows and off-key notes.\nIs this all there is? Sunday attendance. Pretty songs. Faithful tithings.\nGolden crosses. Three-piece suits. Big choirs. Leather Bibles. It is nice and all, but … where is the heart of it? …\nThink about these words from Paul in 1 Corinthians, chapter 15. “For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures” (NIV).\nThere it is. Almost too simple. Jesus was killed, buried, and resurrected.\nSurprised? The part that matters is the cross. No more and no less. ',
