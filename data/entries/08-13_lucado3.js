Yet David, the man after God’s own heart, said, “I’m asking GOD for one thing, only one thing: to live with him in his house my whole life long” (Psalm 27:4 MSG).\nWhat is this house of God that David seeks? Is David describing a physical structure? Does he long for a building with four walls and a door through which he can enter but never exit? No. Our Lord “does not live in temples built by human hands” (Acts 17:24 NIV). When David says, “I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever” (Psalm 23:6 NIV), he’s not saying he wants to get away from people. He’s saying that he yearns to be in God’s presence, wherever he is.\nThe great thing about being with God? Wherever we are, we’re home. ',
