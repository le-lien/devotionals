    "body": 'If you lose your faith, you will probably do so gradually. You will let a few days slip by without consulting your compass. Your sails will go untrimmed. Your rigging will go unprepared. And worst of all, you will forget to anchor your boat. And, before you know it, you’ll be bouncing from wave to wave in stormy seas.\nAnd unless you anchor deep, you could go down.\nHow do you anchor deep? Look at the verse again: “We must pay more careful attention … to what we have heard… . ”\nThe most reliable anchor points are not recent discoveries, but are time-tested truths that have held their ground against the winds of change. Truths like: My life is not futile.\nMy failures are not fatal.\nMy death is not final.\nAttach your soul to these boulders and no wave is big enough to wash you under. ',
