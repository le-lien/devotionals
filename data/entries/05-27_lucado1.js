    "body": 'Jesus didn’t act unless he saw his father act. He didn’t judge until he heard his father judge. No act or deed occurred without his father’s guidance… .\nBecause Jesus could hear what others couldn’t, he acted differently than they did. Remember when everyone was troubled about the man born blind? Jesus wasn’t. Somehow he knew that the blindness would reveal God’s power (John 9:3). Remember when everyone was distraught about Lazarus’s illness? Jesus wasn’t… . It was as if Jesus could hear what no one else could… . Jesus had unbroken communion with his father.\nDo you suppose the Father desires the same for us? Absolutely! … God desires the same abiding intimacy with you that he had with his son. ',
