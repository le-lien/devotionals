I know every English teacher would like to pluralize it to read: The most difficult pursuits are those of truth and love. But that’s not what I mean to say.\nLove is a difficult pursuit.\nTruth is a tough one, too.\nBut put them together, pursue truth and love at the same time and hang on baby, you’re in for the ride of your life.\nLove in truth. Truth in love. Never one at the expense of the other. Never the embrace of love without the torch of truth. Never the heat of truth without the warmth of love… .\nTo pursue both is our singular task.
