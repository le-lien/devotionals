Jesus taught people that “it was necessary for them to pray consistently and never quit”\n(Luke 18:1 MSG). Paul told believers, “Devote yourselves to prayer with an alert mind and a thankful heart” (Col. 4:2 NLT). James declared, “Are any among you suffering? They should keep on praying about it” (James 5:13\nNLT).\nRather than worry about anything, “pray about everything.” Everything?\nDiaper changes and dates? Business meetings and broken bathtubs?\nProcrastinations and prognostications? Pray about everything. ',
