    "body": 'Jesus motions for his guest to sit. Nicodemus does and initiates the most famous conversation in the Bible: “Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him” (John 3:2).\nNicodemus begins with what he “knows.” I’ve done my homework, he implies. Your work impresses me. Nicodemus expects some hospitable chitchat. None comes. Jesus makes no mention of Nicodemus’s VIP status, good intentions, or academic credentials. To Jesus, they don’t matter. He simply issues this proclamation: “Unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God” (v. 3).\nBehold the Grand Canyon of Scripture. Nicodemus stands on one side, Jesus on the other, and Christ pulls no punches about their differences.\nNicodemus inhabits a land of good efforts and hard work. Give God your best, his philosophy says, and God does the rest.\nJesus’ response? Your best won’t do. Your works don’t work. Your finest efforts don’t mean squat. Unless you decide to live your life for Christ, you can’t even see what God is up to. ',
