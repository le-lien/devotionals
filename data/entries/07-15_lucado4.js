Noah’s faith sees the rainbow.\n• Human eyes see a giant. David’s faith sees the giant Goliath fall.\n• Your eyes see your faults. Your faith sees Jesus your Savior.\nWhen you look in the mirror, do you see your mistakes, your sins? It’s easy for our human eyes to only see what is wrong. We need to use our\n“eyes of faith”—the way God sees things—to see what is right. Look in the mirror again, using your eyes of faith. I can tell you what God sees there—\nHis beloved child, the one He has promised all of heaven to. ',

Can you think of others? You may not be able to see them, but you can see what they do—just like you can see what God does.'
