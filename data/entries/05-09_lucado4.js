Pick a time in your day and a corner of your world, and make that your time and place for God. You may want to listen to God first thing in the morning. Or you may like nighttime better.\nA second tool you need is an open Bible. God speaks to you through His Word. The first step in reading the Bible is to ask God to help you understand it. Search God’s Word for what He is really telling you, not what you want Him to say. ',
