Especially agape  love—\nthe kind of love that wants the best for others.\nTruth is a tough one too. Not the who-really-broke-the-glass kind of truth. But the kind of truth that wants to lead others to God.\nBut put them together, try to have truth and love at the same time, and—\nwhew!—you’ve got your work cut out for you.\nLove in truth. Truth in love. Never one without the other. ',

But it’s important to help for the right reason—because you love them—and not just because you want to be right.',
      "text": 'Growing in Grace When you are tempted to tell someone they’re wrong about something they believe, ask yourself why you are doing it. Is it because you love that person and want to build up his or her faith? Or because you love yourself and want to feel that you’re better than someone else? Ask yourself,  What would Jesus say?'
