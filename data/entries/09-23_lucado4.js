Our minds simply don’t have the hooks on which to hang those kinds of thinking caps. So God becomes like the parent who says, “Just trust Me.”\nDon’t be troubled by when or how Jesus will return. Don’t be worried about things you can’t understand. Many people look for clues and hidden messages, trying to figure out exactly when Christ will come back and exactly what that day will look like. But for the Christian, the return of Christ is not a riddle to be solved or a code to be broken. It is a day to be hoped for and waited for with joy and excitement. And until that day comes, we will trust God with our future. ',
