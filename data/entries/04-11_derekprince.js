    "body": 'There is tremendous potential in giving thanks. Not only does it release the miracle-working power of God, but also after God’s miracle-working power has been set in operation, giving thanks sets the seal on the blessings received.\nAs he [Jesus]  was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy met him. They stood at a distance and called out in a loud voice,\n“Jesus, Master, have pity on us!” When he saw them, he said,\n“Go, show yourselves to the priests.” And as they went, they were cleansed. One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice. He threw himself at Jesus’ feet and thanked him—and he was a Samaritan. Jesus asked, “Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine? Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?” Then he said to him, “Rise and go; your faith has made you well.”\n(Luke 17:12–19 niv)\nAll ten lepers were healed physically. But something extra happened to the one who returned to give thanks. Jesus said, “Rise and go; your faith has made you well.”  The word for “well”  in Greek is sozo, meaning\n“to save.” Again, it nearly always indicates something more than mere physical or temporary provision from God. It is the all-inclusive word for salvation.\nThere was one important difference between the lepers. Nine were healed in an exclusively physical sense. The tenth, who came back to give thanks to God, was healed not only physically, but also spiritually—\nhis soul was saved. He was brought into a right, eternal relationship with God. The nine others received a partial, temporary blessing; the tenth received total, permanent blessing. The difference was the giving of thanks.\nThank You, Jesus, for Your work on the cross. I proclaim that giving thanks brings total, permanent blessing and that Jesus was wounded that I might be healed. Amen. ',
