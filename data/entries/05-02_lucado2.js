    "body": 'Someone you love or respect slams you to the floor with a slur or slip of the tongue. And there you lie, wounded and bleeding. Perhaps the words were intended to hurt you, perhaps not; but that doesn’t matter. The wound is deep. The injuries are internal. Broken heart, wounded pride, bruised feelings.\nIf you have suffered or are suffering because of someone else’s words, you’ll be glad to know that there is a balm for this laceration. Meditate on these words from 1 Peter 2:23: “When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate. . . . Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.”\nDid you see what Jesus did? … He left the judging to God. He did not take on the task of seeking revenge. He demanded no apology… . He, to the astounding contrary, spoke on their defense. “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing” (Luke 23:34 NIV). ',
