Do you ever think to yourself: There’s no way out of this mess.  Or , God can’t help me. This problem is just too big.\nIf you’ve had thoughts like that, listen to what His Word says: “With God’s power working in us, God can do much, much more than anything we can ask or think of ” (Ephesians 3:20).\nDid you get that? You can’t even begin  to imagine what God will do for you and through you—when you let His power work in you. When your problems seem bigger than the answers, ask your big God to help. Keep praying and trusting Him with everything in your life. See what He will do! ',

I don’t know how You can fix this problem, but I know that You can —and I can’t wait to see how You do it! Thank You, God, for answering my prayer—because I know that You will. In Jesus’ name, amen.”'
