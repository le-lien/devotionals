Another on your shoulder during a trial? A handshake of welcome at a new job? …\nCan’t we offer the same?\nMany of you already do. Some of you have the master touch of the Physician himself. You use your hands to pray over the sick and minister to the weak. If you aren’t touching them personally, your hands are writing letters, dialing phones, baking pies. You have learned the power of a touch.\nBut others of us tend to forget. Our hearts are good; it’s just that our memories are bad. We forget how significant one touch can be… .\nAren’t we glad Jesus didn’t make the same mistake? ',
