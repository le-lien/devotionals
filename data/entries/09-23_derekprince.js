    "body": 'Let’s take a closer look at the relationship of the Father to His children: “For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, from whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named”\n(Ephesians 3:14–15).\nThe J. B. Phillips translation of verse 15 reads, “From whom all fatherhood, earthly or heavenly, derives its name.”  This verse contains a tremendous revelation—that the fatherhood of God is eternal, named after the fatherhood of God in heaven and deriving its sanctity and authority from being a projection on earth of the divine, eternal fatherhood of God in heaven.\nBefore creation ever took place, God was already a Father—the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. This relationship of fatherhood and sonship within the Godhead is eternal. Before creation was brought into being, God was eternally a Father and Christ was eternally His Son. Every fatherhood in creation is named after the eternal fatherhood of God.\nIn a familiar verse from the gospel of John, Jesus said,  “In My Father’s house are many mansions” (John 14:2). This verse reveals the fact that God is a Father, and He has a house. In Scripture, however, the word  house  is never used primarily to indicate a physical, material building. Rather, it is always used of a family and the building they occupy. When Jesus said, “In My Father’s house,”  He was talking about God’s heavenly family. God is eternally a Father, and family life has its origin in eternity in the father/son relationship within the Godhead.\nThank You, Father, that I am Your child. I proclaim that the fatherhood of God is eternal, and I am part of God’s heavenly family. I have received the Spirit of sonship, and by Him, I cry, “Abba, Father.” Amen.\nFatherhood (audio)\n312\nDECLARING GOD’S WORD\nDeclaring God’s Word text_vNZ.indd 312\n4/09/2013 11:38:28 a.m.\nWEEK 39:\nMy Father has\nmade me.\nDo you thus deal with the Lord, O foolish\nand unwise people?
