Those are God’s mountains, the ones that only He can climb. It’s not that you aren’t welcome to try; it’s just that you aren’t able.\nYou aren’t supposed to fix all your own problems, or run the whole world, or get yourself to heaven. ',

But you can’t work hard enough or climb fast enough to get over the mountain of your own sins and mistakes. You don’t have that kind of power. You need God to map out the way, to guide your hands and feet, and to hold the ropes so that you don’t fall.',
      "text": 'Growing in Grace Have you ever noticed all the gear that mountain climbers have? They have all kinds of safety harnesses and ropes that protect them from falling. God is kind of like that safety gear. He gives you the strength and confidence to climb, and He keeps you safe from falling.'
