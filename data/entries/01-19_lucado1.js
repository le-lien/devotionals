    "body": 'David, the man after God’s own heart, said: “I’m asking Yahweh for one thing, only one thing: to live with him in his house my whole life long”\n… (Ps 27:4 MSG).\nWhat is this house of God which David seeks? Is David describing a physical structure? Does he long for a building with four walls and a door through which he can enter but never exit? No. “Our Lord does not live in temples built by human hands” (Acts 17:24). When David says, “I will live in the house of the LORD forever” (Ps. 23:6), he’s not saying he wants to get away from people. He’s saying that he yearns to be in God’s presence, wherever he is. ',
