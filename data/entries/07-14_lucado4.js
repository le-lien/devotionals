You are a gift to the world, a divine work of art signed by God.\nOne of the greatest gifts I ever received is a football signed by thirty former professional quarterbacks. There is nothing unique or special about the ball itself. For all I know it was bought at a discount sporting goods store. What makes it special are the signatures. ',

What makes us special is not our body but the signature of God on our lives. We are His works of art. We are created in His image to do good deeds. We are important and valuable, not because of what we do but because of whose we are.',
