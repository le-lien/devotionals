When was the last time you did something kind for someone in your family—got a blanket, cleaned off the table, made the coffee—without being asked?\nThink about your school. Which person is the most overlooked or avoided? A shy student? A grumpy secretary? Maybe he doesn’t speak the language. Maybe she doesn’t fit in. Are you kind to this person?\nKind hearts are quietly kind. They let the car cut into traffic and the young mom with three kids move up in the checkout line. They pick up the neighbor’s trash can that rolled into the street. And they are especially kind at church. They understand that perhaps the neediest person they’ll meet all week is the one standing in the foyer or sitting in the row behind them in worship. Paul writes, “When we have the opportunity to help anyone, we should do it. But we should give special attention to those who are in the family of believers” (Galatians 6:10 NCV). ',
