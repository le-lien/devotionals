Look past the finish line — that’s God clapping.\nListen for Him in the bleachers, shouting your name. Too tired to finish?\nHe’ll carry you. Too hopeless to keep going? He’ll pick you up. God is for you.\nGod is for you. If He had a calendar, your birthday would be circled. If He drove a car, your name would be on His bumper sticker. If there’s a tree in heaven, He’s carved your name in it.\n“Can a woman forget the baby she nurses? Can she feel no kindness for the child she gave birth to?” God asks in Isaiah 49:15. Can you imagine your mom feeding you and then asking, “What is that kid’s name?” No.\nMothers don’t do that. They stroke your hair, touch your face, sing your name over and over. Do mothers forget? No way. But “even if she could forget … I will not forget you,” God promises (Isaiah 49:15).',
