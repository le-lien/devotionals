As a result, your sin brings no guilt, and the grave brings no fear.\nHis energy: it’s not up to you. You can do all things through Christ, who gives you strength.\nHis lordship: he is in charge of you and looks out for you.\nHis love: what can separate you from it?\nWho could imagine such gifts? Who could imagine not opening them? ',
