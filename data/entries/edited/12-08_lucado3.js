I believe in love, even when it isn’t shown. I believe in God, even when he doesn’t speak.”\nI try to imagine the person who etched those words. I try to picture his skeleton-like hand gripping the broken glass or stone that cut into the wall. I try to imagine his eyes squinting through the darkness as he carved each letter. What hand could have cut such a conviction? What eyes could have seen good in such horror?\nThere is only one answer: Eyes that understand the words of Paul. “So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal” (2 Corinthians 4:18 NIV). Do you see the unseen?',
