You plead with him to keep your business afloat. You implore him to remove the cancer from your body. What if his answer is, “My grace is enough”? Would you be content?nYou see, from heaven’s perspective, grace is enough. If God did nothing more than save us from hell, could anyone complain?... Having been given eternal life, dare we grumble at an aching body? Having been given heavenly riches, dare we bemoan earthly poverty?..\nIf you have eyes to read these words, hands to hold this book, the means to own this volume, he has already given you grace upon grace.',
