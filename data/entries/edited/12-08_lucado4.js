It is only by His mercy that we are lifted up and saved. Prayer reminds us of who God is (the One in charge) and who we are (the one He loves enough to help).\nI believe there’s great power in prayer. I believe that God heals the sick and wounded and that He can raise the dead. But I don’t believe we tell God what to do and when to do it.\nGod knows that sometimes we don’t even know what we should pray for.\nWhen we trust our prayers to Him, we trust Him to do what is right for us - even if it’s not what we asked for. We let God decide what is best.',

The Spirit speaks to God with deep feelings that words cannot explain” (Romans 8:26). Just open your heart to God, and let the Holy Spirit speak.'
