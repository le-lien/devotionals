Not just those who know every memory verse but those who let His verses change their lives.\nNot just those who lead the prayers but those who trust God to answer their prayers. And not just those who sing every note perfectly but those who sing praises to Him with all their heart.\nThe heavenly reward goes to those who truly look for Jesus. And what is the heavenly reward? Nothing less than being like Jesus. “And as the Spirit of the Lord works within us, we become more and more like him” (2 Corinthians 3:18 TLB).\nCan you think of a greater gift than to be like Jesus? Jesus had no guilt; God wants to wash away yours. Jesus had kindness for the sick and courage for the challenges. God wants you to have the same. He wants you to be just like Jesus.',
