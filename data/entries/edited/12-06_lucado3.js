        "body": 'You’ve daydreamed about getting married someday. But how will you choose a lifelong partner?\nA person makes two big decisions in life. The first has to do with faith.\nThe second has to do with family. The first defines the second. Your God defines your family. If your God is yourself, then you call your own shots because your marriage is for your pleasure and nothing more. But if your God is Christ, then he calls the shots because your marriage is for his honor. And he has an opinion about your choice in a mate. “Don’t become partners with those who reject God. How can you make a partnership out of right and wrong?” (2 Corinthians 6:14 MSG).\nMarry someone who loves God more than you do. The longer you date a nonbeliever, the longer you postpone the opportunity for God to bring the right person your way. If you are a child of God and you marry a child of the Devil, you’re going to have trouble with your father-in-law.',
