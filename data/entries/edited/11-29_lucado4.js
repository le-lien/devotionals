Maybe it was a test or your parents’ trust. Yes, you’ve told God you’re sorry. You know that He has forgiven you and forgotten all about it. But still you can’t seem to let it go. You keep remembering the mistake.\nHear this: Even if you’ve messed up, even if you’ve failed, even if everyone else has turned their back on you, Jesus will never turn away from you. He wants to take all your worries away - whether you’re worried about past mistakes or something that might happen in the future.\nBut only you can let go of your worries. No one else can do it for you.\nOnly you can give all your worries to the One who cares for you (1 Peter 5:7). Say a prayer today and ask God to take your worries away... and then let Him!',

But the Bible says, “Give all your worries to him, because he cares for you” (1 Peter 5:7). Give your worries to God —and don’t snatch them back again. He will do what’s right for you. '
