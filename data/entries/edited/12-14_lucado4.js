And he calls them by name.\nWhen we see a crowd of people, we see just that—a crowd. We see people, not each person, but people. A herd of humans. A flock of faces. That’s what we see.\nBut not so with Jesus, the Good Shepherd. He knows each of His sheep. Each face is special to Him. Each face is different. Each face has a story. Each face is a child. And each child has a name.\nThe Shepherd knows His sheep. He knows each one by name. The Shepherd knows you. He knows your name. And He will never forget it.',
