Would you be happy?\nMaybe you’ve begged God to help you pass a test. Or find your lost pet.\nOr even heal someone you love. What if His answer is, “No. My grace is enough. Saving you is enough”? Would you be happy?\nYou see, from heaven’s point of view, grace is  enough. If the only thing God did was save us, could we really complain? If He only gave us eternal life, would we dare grumble about a hurting body? If He only gave us all the riches of heaven, would we dare whine about being poor on earth?\nIf you have eyes to read these words and hands to hold this book, God has already given you a mountain of grace. But because He loves you so much, He doesn’t just give you grace. He answers your prayers too.',
