Everything from acne to anorexia leaves us feeling like the kid with no date to the prom.\nWe react. We validate our existence with a flurry of activity. We do more, buy more, achieve more. We try to say the right things, get the right look, hang with the right people. We try to fit in. All of it is a way of asking the burning question in our hearts: “Do I belong?”\nGod has an answer. His grace—outrageous, overflowing, stretching beyond the stars and back again—is the definitive reply. “Be blessed, my child. I love you. I accept you. I have adopted you into my family.”\nAdopted children are chosen children.',
