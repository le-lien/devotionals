        "body": 'One essential requirement for running a successful race is having a right mental attitude. This truth was exemplified by the words of Paul as he spoke about his relationship to Jesus Christ: <i>“That I may know Him, and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death; in order that I may attain to the resurrection from the dead”</i> (Philippians 3:10–11 nasb).\nPaul had a specific objective. He did not run aimlessly. (See 1 Corinthians 9:26.) He had an aim before him. He knew what the goal was, which determined his mental attitude. He continued, <i>“Not that I have already obtained it, or have already become perfect</i> [complete], <i>but I press on in order that I may lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus”</i> (verse 12 nasb). Paul’s vision was that Christ had laid hold of him for a purpose; fulfilling that purpose meant that he would have to relate to this purpose. He had to be determined that the purpose of Christ would become his purpose.\n<i>Brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.</i> (verses 13–14 nasb)\nThe phrase <i>“I press on”</i>  occurs twice, once in verse 12 and once in verse 14. That is the mental attitude we need to share with Paul: <i>“I press on. I have a goal. I have not yet arrived, but I know where I’m headed.”</i>\nThe last time Paul used that phrase, he said, “I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.”  There is a reward for those who successfully complete the race. Always keep the goal in mind, for we do not want to lose our God-appointed reward.',
