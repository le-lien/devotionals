Each time he said, ‘My grace is all you need’” (2 Corinthians 12:7–9 NLT).\nSuch vivid imagery. The sharp end of a thorn pierces the soft skin of life and lodges beneath the surface. Every step is a reminder of the thorn in the flesh. The disease in the body. The sadness in the heart. The sister in the rehab center. The dad moving out. The D on the report card. The craving to be one of the cool crowd.\n“Take it away,” you’ve pleaded. This wound oozes pain, and you see no sign of tweezers coming from heaven. But what you hear is this: “My grace is all you need.”\nGod’s grace is not a gentle shower washing away the problem. It is a raging, roaring river whose current knocks you off your feet and carries you into the presence of God.',
