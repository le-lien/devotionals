You take vitamins, get your shots, look both ways before crossing the street, and avoid playing in traffic. Why?\nBecause you are worried about staying alive. That won’t be a worry in heaven, because you’ll live forever.\nIn fact, you won’t be worrying at all. Some of us worry about getting hurt. We won’t worry in heaven, because in heaven we’ll feel no pain.\nSome of us worry about getting sick. We won’t worry in heaven, because in heaven we’ll be healthy forever.\nOn earth we are made of dust. Our physical bodies grow old and wear out. But in heaven our bodies will be different. They will never grow old or wear out. Jesus promises that if we will believe in Him, if we will “be faithful,” then He will give us “the crown of life” (Revelation 2:10).',

Adopt a shut-in from your church this Christmas.\nBake some cookies and take them with you when you go for a visit. The gift of your time can be the very best gift of all to someone who is lonely.'
