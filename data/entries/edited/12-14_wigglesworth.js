    "body": 'Lots of people desire to have faith; many desire to have prophecy; some long to know mysteries. Who knows mysteries? “The secret of the LORD is with those who fear Him” (Ps. 25:14). Don‘t change the Scriptures. “The just shall live by faith”  (Rom. 1:17). Do not alter the Scriptures.\n\nDo not forget that prophecy is beautiful when you understand the principle of it. Prophecy is the sixth gift mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12. What fruit or grace do you think would coincide with prophecy? Why, goodness, of course.\n\nWhy goodness? Because if you are living in holiness, entire sanctification, perfection, you would never take advantage of the Holy Spirit and would speak only as the Spirit gave prophecy. You would never say human things just because you had the gift of prophecy. You would speak according to the Spirit, giving prophecy because you had been holy.\n\nWhen you speak in the natural after you have received the gift of prophecy, it is because you have come to be nothing; you are nothing; you are not counted in the great plan of the great purpose of God. But if you are hidden in Christ and your whole heart is perfected in God, and you will prophesy only when the Spirit of the Lord is upon you, then it will be something that lasts forever. People will be blessed forever and God will be glorified forever.\n\nSuppose that I have all faith so that I could move mountains. Now, suppose that I also have a big farm, but that some of my farmland is not very profitable. It is stony; it has many rocks on it as well as some little mountains that are absolutely untillable and do no good. But because I have faith without love, I say, "I will use my faith and I will move this land. I do not care where it goes as long as my land is clean."\n\nSo I use my faith to clear my land. The next day, my poor next-door neighbor comes and says, "I am in great trouble. All your wasteland and stony, rocky land has been tipped onto mine, and my good land is ruined."\n\nAnd I, who have faith without love, say to him, "You get faith and move it back!"\n\nThat profits nothing. If God brings you into a place of faith, let it be for the glory of God. Then, when you pray, God will wonderfully answer you; nothing will hinder your being used for God, for God delights to use us.\n\nGifts are not only given; they are also increased to those who can be used, who can keep in a place of usefulness. God keeps these yielded ones in a place of being continually supplanted—a new place that is deeper, higher, holier, richer, more heavenly.\n\nIn addition, gifts are not only usable, but God is also glorified in Jesus when you pray the prayer of faith. Jesus Himself said, "When you pray and believe, the Father will be glorified in the Son." (See <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/114/JHN.14.NKJV?parallel=151">John 14:12–13</a>.)',
