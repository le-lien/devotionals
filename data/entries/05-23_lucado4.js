Could it be that unity—loving one another and sticking together—is the way we can tell the world about Jesus?\nIf unity is the key to reaching others, shouldn’t it have an important place in our prayers? Shouldn’t we, as Paul said, “do all [we] can to continue together” (Ephesians 4:3)? If sticking together matters to God, then shouldn’t sticking together matter to us? If unity is important in heaven, then shouldn’t it be important on earth? ',

      "title": 'Nobody wants to be around people who fuss and fight. So if God’s people want to help others learn about Jesus, we must first show them that we love each other. That means we don’t talk badly about each other. We treat each other with kindness and respect. We help each other, and we stick together. God’s people must love each other before  they can love others.',
      "text": 'Growing in Grace Unity—sticking together—is important for churches, but it’s also important for families and friendships. Ephesians 4:2 is the perfect recipe for keeping unity: “Always be humble and gentle. Be patient and accept each other with love.”'
