    "body": 'For all its strange names and unusual events, the Bible has a simple story: God made people. People turned away from God. God won’t give up until He wins His people back. God will whisper. He will shout. He will touch and tug. He will take away our worries and fears. He will even take away our blessings. If there are 1,000 steps between us and Him, He will take 999. But He will leave the last step for us to take. The choice is ours.\nPlease understand. God’s goal is not to make you happy. His goal is to make you His. His goal is not to get you what you want. It is to get you what you need—a faith in His Son that will get you to heaven.\nGrowing in Grace\nUse a roll of craft paper or sheets of paper taped together to make a mural of the story of Jesus. Begin with His birth and go all the way to the Resurrection. But don’t stop there. Draw what Jesus means to you. Hang your mural on the wall or roll it into a scroll.\nSeptember ',
