But to think that your name is on God’s hand and on God’s lips … my, could it be?\nOr perhaps you have never seen your name honored. And you can’t remember when you heard it spoken with kindness. If so, it may be more difficult for you to believe that God knows your name.\nBut he does. Written on his hand. Spoken by his mouth. Whispered by his lips. Your name. ',
