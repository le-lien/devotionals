Healing begins when we reach out.\nHealing starts when we take a step.\nGod’s help is near and always available, but it is only given to those who seek it. Nothing results from sitting around, waiting for God to notice us.\nSometimes the whole purpose of our problems is to get us to move closer to him. To pray to him. To praise him. To shout, “God, do something!” We must request his help and have faith that he will act.\nGod honors radical, risk-taking faith. When arks are built, lives are saved.\nWhen staffs are raised, seas still open. When a lunch is shared, thousands are fed. And when in faith you call on him to provide courage to confront a friend or healing to cure a sick sibling, you can expect an amazing response. He is always near, ready to step in. The first move is up to us.\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
