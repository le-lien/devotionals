    "body": 'The Scripture does not say "the gift of wisdom" but the gift of “the word of wisdom.”  You have to “rightly [handle] the T word of truth”  (2 Tim. 2:15). The gift of the word of wisdom is necessary in many instances. For example, when you want to build another church building, maybe larger than the one you are in, so that everybody can speak and be heard without any trouble, a word of wisdom is needed regarding how to build the place for God‘s service.\n\nWhen you are faced with a choice and it is difficult for you to know in what direction to go, that word can come to you in a moment and prepare you for the right way.\n\nThe gift of the word of wisdom is meant for a needy hour when you are under great stress concerning some business transaction; provided it is a godly transaction, you can ask God what to do, and you will receive wisdom.\n\nI have been trying to show you that if you are filled with the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit can manifest any gift. At the same time, you are not to forget that the Word of God urges you to desire earnestly the best gifts; so while the best gift might be to you the word of wisdom, or some other gift, you should not be lacking in any gift.\n\nThis is a remarkable statement for me to make, but Scripture lends itself to me to be extravagant. When God speaks to me He says, "Anything you ask." (See John 15:7.) When God is speaking of the world‘s salvation He says, "Whosoever believes." (See John 3:16.) So I have an extravagant God with extravagant language to make me an extravagant person—in wisdom.\n\nTo this end, we pray that God will show us now why we really need the word of wisdom and how we may be in a place in which we will surely know it is of God.',
