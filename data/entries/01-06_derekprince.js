    "passage": 'The blood alone could offer propitiation for the sins of God’s people, and it had to be brought into the presence of Almighty God in the Holy of Holies. I want you to notice in particular that the blood was sprinkled seven times. This frequency was no coincidence, for in the Bible, seven is the number that indicates the work of the Holy Spirit. Seven is also the number of completeness, or perfection.',
