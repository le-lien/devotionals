So it’s smart to be prepared.\nAs you grow up, you’ll start making more and more decisions for yourself. You’ll face some tough choices. And you’ll have to decide which way your life will go and which way it won’t. But God doesn’t leave you on your own. “I made you and will take care of you,” He promises.\nLook in His Word; He gives you plenty of advice. And look around you; He gives you plenty of good examples to follow. ',
