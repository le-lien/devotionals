Is she popular? These things don’t matter to God. He sees two kinds of people: the saved and the lost.\nFrom His point of view, every person is either:\n• Entering through the narrow gate or the wide gate (Matthew 7:13-14).\n• Called to heaven or headed for hell (Mark 16:15-16).\nAsk God to help you look at others the way He does. To have a heart like God’s is to look into the faces of the saved and be happy. They are headed for heaven. To have a heart like God’s is to look into the faces of the lost and pray. For unless they turn to God, they are headed for an eternity without Him. ',
