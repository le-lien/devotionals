    "body": 'In my closet hangs a sweater that I seldom wear. It is too small… .\nI should throw that sweater away… . But love  won’t let me… .\nIt’s the creation of a devoted mother expressing her love… . Each strand was chosen with care. Each thread was selected with affection. . . . It is valuable not because of its function, but because of its maker.\nThat must have been what the psalmist had in mind when he wrote, “You knit me together in my mother’s womb.”\nThink on those words. You were knitted together. You aren’t an accident.\nYou weren’t mass-produced. You aren’t an assemblyline product.\nYou were deliberately planned, specifically gifted, and lovingly positioned on this earth by the Master Craftsman… . In a system that ranks the value of a human by the figures of his salary or the shape of her legs …\nlet me tell you something: Jesus’ plan is a reason for joy! ',
