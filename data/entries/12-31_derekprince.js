    "body": 'The climax of the priestly blessing that Aaron and his descendants were instructed to pronounce on the people of Israel came with these words: “So they shall put My name on the children of Israel, and I will bless them”  (Numbers 6:27).\nOften, the most effective prayers we can offer on behalf of others are prayers of praise and thanksgiving, invoking the name of the Lord Jesus on them. When we put the name of Jesus on those for whom we are praying, we invoke God’s blessing on them. Few of us realise how much we uplift people in their spirits when we simply praise God for them. It is a major part of our ministry as intercessors.\n“Praying Hyde” was an outstanding missionary in the Punjab in India in the last century, when India was still under British rule. Hyde’s ministry was prayer; everything else was secondary. Early on, he came across an Indian evangelist whom he considered ineffective and cold.\nAs he began to pray about this man, he said, “Lord, You know—” he was going to say, “—how cold Brother So-and-so is.” But the Holy Spirit stopped him with Proverbs 30:10: “Do not slander a servant to his master”  (niv).\nSo, Brother Hyde changed his approach. He began to think of everything good in that man’s life and to thank God for him. Within a few months, that man became outstandingly successful as an evangelist.\nWhat changed him? Not being accused in prayer, but being the object of thanksgiving.\nGod has taught me that if I cannot thank Him for somebody, I probably have no right to pray for that person. I had better not pray at all because my prayer may do more harm than good. As Numbers 6:27 says, “So they shall put My name on the children of Israel, and I will bless them.”\nThank You, Lord. I give You praise. I proclaim that I do not\n“slander a servant” but instead invoke God’s blessing on him or her. I shall continually offer up a sacrifice of praise. Amen.\nHusbands and Fathers (book)\nDECEMBER 425\nDeclaring God’s Word text_vNZ.indd 425\n4/09/2013 11:38:38 a.m.\nDeclaring God’s Word text_vNZ.indd 426\n4/09/2013 11:38:38 a.m.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nDerek Prince (1915–2003) was born in India of British parents.\nEducated as a scholar of Greek and Latin at Eton College and Cambridge University, England, he held a Fellowship in Ancient and Modern Philosophy at King’s College. He also studied several modern languages, including Hebrew and Aramaic, at Cambridge University and the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.\nWhile serving with the British army in World War II, he began to study the Bible and experienced a life-changing encounter with Jesus Christ. Out of this encounter he formed two conclusions: first, that Jesus Christ is alive; second, that the Bible is a true, relevant, up-to-date book. These conclusions altered the whole course of his life, which he then devoted to studying and teaching the Bible.\nDerek’s main gift of explaining the Bible and its teaching in a clear and simple way has helped build a foundation of faith in millions of lives. His non-denominational, non-sectarian approach has made his teaching equally relevant and helpful to people from all racial and religious backgrounds.\nHe is the author of over 50 books, 600 audio and 100 video teachings, many of which have been translated and published in more than 100\nlanguages. His daily radio broadcast is translated into Arabic, Chinese (Amoy, Cantonese, Mandarin, Shanghaiese, Swatow), Croatian, German, Malagasy, Mongolian, Russian, Samoan, Spanish, Bahasa Indonesian and Tongan. The radio program continues to reach many people around the world.\nDerek Prince Ministries continues its ministry of reaching out to believers in over 140 countries with Derek’s teachings, fulfilling the mandate to keep on “until Jesus returns”. This is effected through the outreaches of more than 30 Derek Prince Offices around the world, including primary work in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Russia, South Africa, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States and the Islands of the Pacific.\nFor current information about these and other worldwide locations, visit www.derekprince.com\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n427\nDeclaring God’s Word text_vNZ.indd 427\n4/09/2013 11:38:38 a.m.\n428\nDECLARING GOD’S WORD\nDeclaring God’s Word text_vNZ.indd 428\n4/09/2013 11:38:38 a.m.\nBOOKS BY DEREK PRINCE\nAppointment in Jerusalem\nAt the End of Time\nAuthority and Power of God’s Word, The\nBaptism in the Holy Spirit\nBlessing or Curse: You Can Choose\nBought with Blood (formerly Atonement)\nBurial by Baptism\nBy Grace Alone\nCalled to Conquer\nComplete Salvation and How to Receive It\nDeclaring God’s Word: A 365-Day Devotional\nDerek Prince: A Biography\nDestiny of Israel and the Church, The\nDivine Exchange, The\nDoctrine of Baptisms, The\nDoes Your Tongue Need Healing?\nEmpowered for Life (formerly Rules of Engagement) End of Life’s Journey, The\nEntering the Presence of God\nExpelling Demons\nExtravagant Love\nFaith and Works\nFaith to Live By\nFasting Successfully\nFatherhood\nFinal Judgment\nFoundations for Life (formerly Foundations for Righteous Living) Founded on the Rock\nGateway to God’s Blessing\nGifts of the Spirit, The\nGod is a Matchmaker\nGod’s Medicine Bottle\nGod’s Plan for Your Money\nGod’s Remedy for Rejection\nGod’s Word Heals\nGrace of Yielding, The\nHarvest Just Ahead, The\nHoly Spirit in You, The\nHow to Pass from Curse to Blessing\nHusbands and Fathers\nDeclaring God’s Word text_vNZ.indd 429\n4/09/2013 11:38:38 a.m.\nIf You Want God’s Best\nImmersion in the Spirit\nLife’s Bitter Pool\nLife-Changing Spiritual Power (6 Book Compilation) Living in God’s Abundance (8 Book Compilation) Lucifer Exposed\nMarriage Covenant, The\nObjective for Living\nOur Debt to Israel\nPages from My Life’s Book\nPartners for Life\nPhilosophy, the Bible, and the Supernatural\nPower in the Name\nPower of Proclamation, The\nPower of the Sacrifice, The\nPraying for the Government\nPromise of Provision, The\nPromised Land\nProphetic Guide to the End Times\nProtection from Deception\nRediscovering God’s Church\nResurrection of the Body\nSecrets of a Prayer Warrior\nSelf-Study Bible Course\nSet Apart for God\nShaping History through Prayer and Fasting\nSound Judgement (formerly Judging)\nSpiritual Warfare\nSurviving the Last Days\nTesting\nThanksgiving, Praise & Worship\nThey Shall Expel Demons\nThree Most Powerful Words, The\nThrough Repentance to Faith\nThrough the Psalms\nTransformed for Life (9 Book Compilation)\nTransmitting God’s Power\nWar in the Heavenlies\nWho Cares for Orphans, Widows, the Poor and Oppressed?\nWho is the Holy Spirit?\nYou Matter to God\nYou Shall Receive Power\nDeclaring God’s Word text_vNZ.indd 430\n4/09/2013 11:38:38 a.m.\nDPM OFFICES\nFor further information about Derek Prince Ministries or to obtain Derek’s teaching materials, please contact your nearest DPM office.\nDPM-ASIA/PACIFIC\nDPM-MALAYSIA\nPO Box 2029\nPh: +60 3 4251 6882\nChristchurch 8140\nEmail: ygmdpm@gmail.com\nNEW ZEALAND\nDPM-NEPAL\nPh: +64 3 366 4443\nC/o The Lord’s Assembly\nFax: +64 3 366 1569\nPO Box 1083\nadmin@dpm.co.nz\nKathmadu\nwww.derekprince.co.nz\nNEPAL\nDPM-AUSTRALIA\nPh: +97 71 411 1729\nUnit 21,\nFax: +97 71 4106 0866\n317-321 Woodpark Road\ntla@wlink.com.np\nSmithfield NSW 2164\nDPM-SOLOMON ISLANDS\nAUSTRALIA\nPO Box 1619\nPh: +61 2 9604 0670\nHoniara\nFax: +61 2 9606 4255\nSOLOMON ISLANDS\nEmail:\nPh: +67 722 151\nenquiries@au.derekprince.com\nFax: +67 739 006\nwww.derekprince.com.au\ndpmsi@solomon.com.sb\nDPM-INDIA\nDPM-SOUTH AFRICA\nNo. 1C, E.V.R.
