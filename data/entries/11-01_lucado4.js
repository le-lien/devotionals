We don’t have what it takes to heal ourselves. Our only hope is that God will do for us what He did for the man at the pool of Bethesda—that He will step out of the temple and step into our world of hurt and helplessness. That He  will heal us. Which is exactly what He has done.\nI wish we would believe what Jesus tells us: When He says we’re forgiven, let’s let go of the guilt and shame. When He says we’re valuable, let’s believe Him. When He says He’ll take care of our needs, let’s stop worrying. ',
