    "body": 'Some years ago, a dear friend of mine was called to the funeral home to identify the body of his father, who had been shot in the middle of the night by his ex-wife. The shotgun blast was just another in a long line of angry outbursts and violent family moments. My friend remembers standing near the body and making this resolution: “It stops with me.”\nMake the same resolve. Your family history may have some sad chapters, but your history doesn’t have to be your future. Talk to God and adult Christians you trust about it. Bring it out in the open. Revealing leads to healing. Don’t just pray: Lord, help me forgive. Give God and others the details: Every day I come home from school to find Mom drunk, lying on the couch. I have to make dinner, take care of baby brother, do homework on my own. It’s not right, God!\nDifficult, for certain. But let God do his work. There is always hope in choosing his future for you.\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
