That’s what the Jews did for people who had died. And it was the last thing that the women could do for their Lord. Peter didn’t offer to do it. Andrew didn’t volunteer to do it. So the two Marys decided to do it (Mark 16:1–2).\nWhat would have happened if, on the way to the tomb, they had changed their minds? What if they had given up? What if one had thrown up her hands and moaned, “I’m tired of being the only one who cares. Let Andrew do something for a change. Let Nathanael take a turn”?\nIt would have been so sad if they had given up and decided to quit. You see, we know something they didn’t. We know the Father was watching. ',
