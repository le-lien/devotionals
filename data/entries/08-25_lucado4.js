If you haven’t needed God to rescue you, you might have an easier time keeping Him at a distance. Sure He’s important, but so are your grades. Your friends. Your sports and hobbies.\nBut maybe you have  seen some of life’s storms, some of its troubles. The move to a new school. The divorce. The lost friend. Sadness might have fallen over you like a fog. In your heart, you weren’t sure where to turn to feel better.\nTurn to your friends for help? Only if you want to hide from the storm instead of escape it. Lean on your grades for strength? A storm isn’t impressed with how much you know.\nOnly God can help you through all of life’s storms. ',
