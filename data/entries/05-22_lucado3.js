You don’t often hear,\n“Could you hand me a napkin, and by the way, are you going to heaven or hell?” Yet God is counting on you to spread his Good News.\nYou don’t have to put a collar around your neck or preach long, boring sermons to be a minister. According to Paul, ministers talk about the gospel everywhere they go and about what God is doing in their lives. It’s not always easy to live your faith out loud, but your courage now can make a difference for eternity.\nWhen you arrive in heaven, I wonder if Christ might say these words to you: “I’m so proud that you let me use you. Because of you, others are here today. Would you like to meet them?” Friends, neighbors, even family members all step forward.\nAre you a minister? You bet. Are you making a difference? Absolutely.
