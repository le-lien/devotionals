But the child of God needn’t fear—for the Father has promised to take us to be with him.\nBut dare we believe the promise? Dare we trust his loyalty? Isn’t there a cautious part of us that wonders how reliable these words may be? …\nHow can we know he will do what he said? How can we believe he will move the rocks and set us free?\nBecause he’s already done it once.\nWhen Christ Comes\nAugust\nBut grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. ',
