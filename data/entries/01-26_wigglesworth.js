Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them.'

    "body": 'These are days when we need to have our faith strengthened, when we need to know God. God has designed that the just will live by faith (Rom. 1:17), no matter how they may be fettered. I know that God‘s Word is sufficient. One word from Him can change a nation. His Word is " from everlasting to everlasting” (Ps. 90:2). It is through the entrance of this everlasting Word, this incorruptible seed, that we are born again and come into this wonderful salvation. “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God”  (Matt. 4:4). This is the food of faith. “Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God”  (Rom. 10:17).\n\nEverywhere people are trying to discredit the Bible and remove its miracles. One preacher says, "Well, you know, Jesus arranged beforehand to have that colt tied where it was and for the men to say just what they did." (See Matthew 21:2–3.) I tell you, God can arrange everything. He can plan for you, and when He plans for you, all is peace. All things are possible if you will believe.\n\nAnother preacher says, "It was an easy thing for Jesus to feed the people with five loaves. The loaves were so big in those days that it was a simple matter to cut them into a thousand pieces each." (See John 6:5–13.) But he forgets that one little boy brought those five loaves all the way in his lunch basket. There is nothing impossible with God.',
