Worship is the awareness that were it not for his touch, you’d still be hobbling and hurting, bitter and broken.\nWorship is the half-glazed expression on the parched face of a desert pilgrim as he discovers that the oasis is not a mirage.\nWorship is the “thank you” that refuses to be silenced.\nWe have tried to make a science out of worship. We can’t do that. We can’t do that any more than we can “sell love” or “negotiate peace.”\nWorship is a voluntary act of gratitude offered by the saved to the Savior, by the healed to the Healer, and by the delivered to the Deliverer.
