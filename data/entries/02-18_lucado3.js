    "body": 'Years ago, my wife, Denalyn, battled a dark cloud of depression. Not just a bad mood, but deep dejection. Every day was gray. One Sunday, when the depression was suffocating, she armed herself with honesty and went to church. If people ask me how I am doing, I’m going to tell them. She answered each “How are you?” with a candid “Not well. I’m depressed. Will you pray for me?”\nCasual chats became long conversations. Brief hellos became heartfelt moments of ministry. By the time she left the worship service, she’d signed up dozens of people to join with her in prayer. She traces the healing of her depression to that Sunday morning service. She found God’s presence in the middle of God’s people.\nAre you struggling with depression? This is no time to be a hermit. Tell the people you trust: friends, parents, teachers, counselors. And tell God! No matter how bad life gets, he’ll be with you. He wants you to know the joy found only in him.\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
