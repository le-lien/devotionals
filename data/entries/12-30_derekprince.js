    "body": 'Praise is a spiritual weapon that we can use to silence the devil.\nThere is perhaps no more important fact in the Bible than this.\nFrom the point of view of practical Christian living, God has given you a way to silence the devil’s mouth. Psalm 8:2 says, “Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have ordained strength, because of Your enemies, that You may silence the enemy and the avenger.”  The psalmist, addressing God, was speaking about “enemies”  in the plural and “the enemy and the avenger”  in the singular. “The enemy and the avenger”\nis none other than the devil himself;  “enemies”  are the evil spirits that are Satan’s instruments against us. Because of Satan and his evil spirits, God has ordained strength that we might silence the devil.\nThis verse was quoted by Jesus in the gospel of Matthew. The quotation is a revelation of the full meaning of this passage. In this scene, Jesus is in the temple, healing the sick, and the children are running to and fro, crying, “Hosanna to the Son of David!” (Matthew 21:15). This upsets the religious leaders, so they say to Jesus, “Do You hear what they are saying?” Jesus then gives us this revelation: “Yes.\nHave you never read, ‘Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have perfected praise’?” (verse 16). Where the psalmist said, “You have ordained strength,”  Jesus said, “You have perfected praise.”  So, we get a simple, direct inference. The “ordained strength” of God’s people in battle is “perfected praise.” God has made it possible for us to silence the devil and all his evil spirits by perfect praise.\nAs “babes and infants,” if we will but praise God perfectly, out of our mouths will come forth a weapon that silences the devil. And God will be glorified. ',
