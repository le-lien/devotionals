We speak of a short life, but compared to eternity, who has a long one? A person’s days on earth may appear as a drop in the ocean. Yours and mine may seem like a thimbleful. But compared to the Pacific of eternity, even the years of Methuselah filled no more than a glass… .\nIn God’s plan every life is long enough and every death is timely. And though you and I might wish for a longer life, God knows better. ',
