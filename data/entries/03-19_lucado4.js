    "body": 'John told us that the blood of Jesus “is making  us clean from every sin.”\nThat means, He is always making  us clean. This cleansing is not just a promise for someday in the future. It is a fact for right now.\nJust let a speck of sin fall on your soul, and it is washed away. Let a spot of filth land on the heart of God’s child, and the filth is wiped away.\nJesus kneels down and looks at the most terrible things we have ever said and done. But He doesn’t step back in horror. Instead, He reaches out in kindness and says, “I can clean that if you want.” And from the bowl of His grace, He scoops out a handful of mercy and washes away our sin. ',

Think of it this way: the next time it rains, wipe off the windshield of your family car while it’s still raining. Did you get tired of wiping away those raindrops? Aren’t you glad that Jesus never tires of washing away our sins?'
