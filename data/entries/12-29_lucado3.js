What if your parents could’ve done this with you? “I’ll take a plate of good grades and cute smiles, and I’m passing on the teenage identity crisis and tuition bills.” What if you could’ve done the same with your parents? “Please give me a helping of allowances and free lodging but no rules or curfews, thank you.”\nAnd your future spouse? “Hmm, how about a bowl of good health and good moods. But job transfers, in-laws, and laundry are not on my diet.”\nWouldn’t it be great if love were like a cafeteria line? It would be easier. It would be neater. It would be painless and peaceful. But you know what? It wouldn’t be love. Love doesn’t accept just a few things. Love is willing to accept all things. ',
