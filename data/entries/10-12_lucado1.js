To regard him as Father is to go a step further. Ideally, a father is the one in your life who provides and protects.\nThis is exactly what God has done.\nHe has provided for your needs (Matt. 6:25–34).\nHe has protected you from harm (Ps. 139:5).\nHe has adopted you (Eph. 1:5). And he has given you his name (1 John 3:1).\nGod has proven himself as a faithful father. Now it falls to us to be trusting children. ',
