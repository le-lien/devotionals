    "body": 'nly believe! God will not fail you, beloved. It is impossible for God to fail. Believe God; rest in Him. The Bible is the most O important book in the world. But some people have to be pressed in before they can be pressed on. Oh, this glorious inheritance of holy joy and faith, this glorious baptism in the Holy Spirit— it is a perfected place. “All things have become new”  (2 Cor. 5:17), because “you are Christ‟s, and Christ is God‟s”  (1 Cor. 3:23).\n\nGod means for us to walk in this royal way. When God opens a door, no man can shut it (Rev. 3:8). John made a royal way, and Jesus walked in it. Jesus left us the responsibility of allowing Him to bring forth through us the greater works (John 14:12). Jesus left His disciples with much and with much more to be added until God receives us in that Day.\n\nWhen we receive power, we must stir ourselves up with the truth that we are responsible for the need around us. God will supply all our need so that the need of the needy may be met through us. God has given us a great indwelling force of power. If we do not step into our privileges, it is a tragedy.\n\nThere is no standing still. “As He is, so are we in this world”  (1 John 4:17). “We are the offspring of God”  (Acts 17:29), and we have divine impulses. After we have received, we will have power. We have been focusing too much on feeling the power. God is waiting for us to act. Jesus lived a life of perfect activity. He lived in the realm of divine appointment.\n\nWe must dare to press on until God comes forth in mighty power. May God give us the hearing of faith so that the power may come down like a cloud. Press on until Jesus is glorified and multitudes are gathered in.',
