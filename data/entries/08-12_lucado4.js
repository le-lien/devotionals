If we struggle and stumble, then we aren’t really His children. We are supposed to be “made new” when we belong to Christ (2\nCorinthians 5:17). So if we sometimes still fall back to our old selfish ways, then we might think, Uh-oh. Maybe I wasn’t made new after all.\nIf you are worried about these things, please remember that “God began doing a good work in you. And he will continue it until it is finished when Jesus Christ comes again” (Philippians 1:6).\nIn other words, don’t worry. God’s still working on you. ',
