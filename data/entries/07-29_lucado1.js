Jesus scattered the butterflies out of the stomachs of his nervous disciples… .\nWe need to remember that the disciples were common men given a compelling task. Before they were the stained-glassed saints in the windows of cathedrals, they were somebody’s next-door-neighbors trying to make a living and raise a family. They weren’t cut from theological cloth or raised on supernatural milk. But they were an ounce more devoted than they were afraid and, as a result, did some extraordinary things.\nEarthly fears are no fears at all. Answer the big question of eternity, and the little questions of life fall into perspective. ',
