    "body": 'Think for a moment of your heart as a greenhouse. Green vines instead of valves and veins. Divided into sections of beans and tomatoes instead of atria and ventricles. What do a greenhouse and your heart have in common?\nBoth have to be managed.\nConsider for a moment your thoughts as seed. Some thoughts become flowers. Others become weeds. Sow seeds of hope and enjoy optimism. Sow seeds of doubt and expect insecurity.\nThe proof is everywhere you look. Ever wonder how some people resist negative ideas and remain patient, optimistic, and forgiving? Could it be that they daily sow seeds of goodness and are able to enjoy the harvest? Ever wonder why others have such a gloomy attitude? You would too if your heart were a greenhouse of weeds and thorns.\nJesus is the master gardener. He knows when to cut back a vine and when to uproot the whole thing and throw it away. Is it time to let him go to work in the greenhouse of your heart?\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
