    "body": 'Blind ambition. Success at all cost. Becoming a legend in one’s own time.\nClimbing the ladder to the top. King of the mountain. Top of the heap. “I did it my way.”\nWe make heroes out of people who are ambitious. We hold them up as models and put their pictures on the covers of our magazines. And rightly so.\nThis world would be in sad shape without people who dream of touching the heavens. Ambition is that grit in the soul that creates disenchantment with the ordinary and puts the dare into dreams.\nBut without God’s guiding hand it becomes an addiction to power and fame; a roaring hunger for achievement that devours people as a lion devours an animal, leaving behind only the skeletal remains of relationships.\nGod won’t tolerate it. Blind ambition is a giant step away from God and one step closer to catastrophe. ',

      "text": 'What does blind ambition look like in your life? Classmates who copy an essay off the Internet? Guys who take steroids to muscle up? People who put down others to make themselves look better? Whatever the case, it’s a road to ruin. Walk God’s way instead.'
