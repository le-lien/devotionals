But they are like saltwater in the desert. They won’t quench our thirst—they just make us thirstier. Why? Because we aren’t thirsty for the things of this world. We are thirsty for God and His goodness.\nMatthew 5:6 says, “Those who want to do right more than anything else are happy.” ',

We crave a “do over.” When we mess up, we want a fresh start. So we pray that God will reach down and do for us the one thing we can’t do for ourselves—make us right again. And when we ask Him to, He promises that He will.',

Feel your throat tighten, your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth. That’s how your soul feels without God. That’s thirsting for righteousness.'
