    "body": 'e must acknowledge our helplessness and nothingness. Although laboring in the Spirit is painful, God can lift the W burden from us. I have had those days when I feel burdened. I have had it this morning, but now God is lifting the heavi-ness. And I say, brother and sister, unless God brings us into a place of brokenness of spirit, unless God remolds us in the great plan of His will for us, the best of us will utterly fail. But when we are absolutely taken in hand by the almighty God, God turns even our weakness into strength. He makes even that barren, helpless, groaning cry come forth, so that men and women are reborn in the travail. There is a place where our helplessness is touched by the power of God and where we come out shining as “gold refined in the fire”  (Rev. 3:18).\n\nIt was on the cross that our Lord died with a broken heart. Pentecost came out of jeering and sneering. It included being mocked and beaten and an offer of sour wine. Jesus received an unfair judgment and a cross that He had to bear. But, glory to God, Pentecost rings out today for you through the words, “It is finished!” (John 19:30). And now because it is finished, we can take the same place that He took and rise out of that death in majestic glory with the resurrection touch of heaven. People will know that God has done something for us.',
