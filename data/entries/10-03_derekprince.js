    "body": 'The call to pray for Jerusalem is directed at everyone who accepts the Bible as God’s authoritative Word. God requires all of His people, from every nation and every background, to be concerned about the peace of one particular city: Jerusalem. There is a practical reason for this. God’s purpose for this age will climax in the establishment of His kingdom. Each time we pray the familiar words, “Thy kingdom come,”\nwe are aligning ourselves with this purpose. (See, for example, Matthew 6:10 kjv.)\nWe must remember, however, that the prayer continues, “Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven”  (verse 6:10 kjv). It is on earth that God’s kingdom is to be established. His kingdom is invisible as yet to human eyes, but it is not vague or amorphous. It will ultimately have a tangible, earthly realization. The capital and center of God’s kingdom on earth will be the city of Jerusalem. The administration of righteous government will go forth from Jerusalem to all nations on earth.\nIn response, the gifts and worship of these nations will flow back to Jerusalem. Thus, the peace and prosperity of all nations depend on that of Jerusalem. Until Jerusalem enters into her peace, no nation on earth can know true, lasting peace.\nTo all who heed God’s call to love Jerusalem and pray for her peace, God gives a special, precious promise:  “They shall prosper” (Psalm 122:6\nkjv). The word translated  “prosper”  goes beyond the material realm. It denotes a deep, inner well-being, a freedom from care and anxiety. As we align ourselves with God’s plan by praying for Jerusalem, we experience a foretaste of His peace. A sense of inner rest and peace comes to those who, in the midst of all the turmoil of this world, associate themselves actively with God’s plans to restore His people. ',
