He uncommons the common by turning kitchen sinks into shrines, cafes into convents, and nine-to-five workdays into spiritual adventures.\nWorkdays?  Yes, workdays. He ordained your work as something good.\nBefore he gave Adam a wife or a child, even before he gave Adam britches, God gave Adam a job. “Then the LORD God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to cultivate it and keep it” (Gen. 2:15 NASB).\nInnocence, not indolence, characterized the first family… .\nGod unilaterally calls all the physically able to till the gardens he gives.\nGod honors work. So honor God in your work. ',
