But sometimes it’s in the most surprising way!\nLook at what He did for these faithful folks… .\nJust when everyone said it was impossible, ninety-year-old Sarah had a baby (Genesis 17:17; 21:2). Just when no one else had the courage to even try, David took down a giant with just a stone (1 Samuel 17:50). And even though it didn’t make sense, Joshua marched around Jericho, and the walls came tumbling down (Joshua 6).\nWhat’s the lesson for you? Just three words: Don’t give up!\nDo you think you’ve got a problem too big for God? A test too hard? A fear too scary? A friendship too broken? Keep praying! God is watching.\nAnd the God who surprised Sarah, David, and Joshua is already working on an answer to your prayers. ',
