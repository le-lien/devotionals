You are assured that someday you will enter a world where there will be no more pain, no more tears, no more sorrow.\nIf you have no faith in the future, then you have no power in the present.\nIf you have no faith in the life beyond this life, then your present life is going to be powerless. But if you believe in the future and are assured of victory, then there should be a dance in your step and a smile on your face. ',
