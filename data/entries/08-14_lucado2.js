To John, Jesus was a friend.\nYou don’t abandon a friend—not even when that friend is dead. John stayed close to Jesus.\nHe had a habit of doing this. He was close to Jesus in the upper room. He was close to Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane. He was at the foot of the cross at the crucifixion, and he was a quick walk from the tomb at the burial.\nDid he understand Jesus? No.\nWas he glad Jesus did what he did? No.\nBut did he leave Jesus? No.\nWhat about you? ',
