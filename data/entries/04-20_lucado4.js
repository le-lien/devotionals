Is it helping orphans? Or the homeless? Or people who don’t know Jesus?\nPay attention to the fire in your heart! Do you love to sing more than anything? Then sing! Does your heart hurt for the sick and the lonely? Then comfort them!\nAs a young man, I felt that God wanted me to preach. But I wasn’t sure if I understood God’s will correctly. So I talked to a minister whom I looked up to. His advice to me was, “Don’t preach unless you have  to.”\nAs I thought about his words, I found my answer. “I have to preach. If I don’t, this fire in my heart will burn me up. If I don’t preach, I’ll spend the rest of my life wishing that I had.” ',
