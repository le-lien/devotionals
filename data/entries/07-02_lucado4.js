By giving God your thoughts during these moments, the ordinary becomes extraordinary. Your prayers don’t need to be out loud. Your eyes don’t have to be closed.\nPrayers can simply be silent whispers—just between you and God. ',

Just pray where you are. Let the kitchen become a church and the classroom become a chapel. Give God your whispering thoughts.',
