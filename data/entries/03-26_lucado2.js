    "body": 'As long as you hate your enemy, a jail door is closed and a prisoner is taken. But when you try to understand and release your foe from your hatred, then the prisoner is released and that prisoner is you.\nPerhaps you don’t like that idea. Perhaps the thought of forgiveness is unrealistic. Perhaps the idea of trying to understand the Judases in our world is simply too gracious.\nMy response to you then is a question. What do you suggest? Will harboring the anger solve the problem? Will getting even remove the hurt?\nDoes hatred do any good? Again, I’m not minimizing your hurt or justifying their actions. But I am saying that justice won’t come this side of eternity. And demanding that your enemy get his or her share of pain will, in the process, be most painful to you.\nMay I gently but firmly remind you of something you know but may have forgotten? Life is not fair. That’s not pessimism; it’s fact. ',
