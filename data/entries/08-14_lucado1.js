The problem is, it wouldn’t give the same satisfaction to my audience… .\nPaul gives good advice in Romans 12:3: “Have a sane estimate of your capabilities” (PHILLIPS).\nIn other words, be aware of your strengths. When you teach, do people listen? When you lead, do people follow? When you administer, do things improve? Where are you most productive? Identify your strengths, and then\n. . . major in them. . . . Failing to focus on our strengths may prevent us from accomplishing the unique tasks God has called us to do. ',
