    "body": 'One of our Brazilian church leaders met Christ during a stay in a drug-rehab center. His therapy included three one-hour sessions of prayer a day.\nPatients didn’t have to pray, but they had to attend the prayer meeting. Dozens of recovering drug addicts spent sixty uninterrupted minutes on their knees.\nI was amazed. I admitted that my prayers were short and formal. He invited (dared?) me to meet him for prayer. We knelt on the concrete floor of our small church auditorium and began to talk to God. Change that. I talked; he cried, wailed, and pleaded. He pounded his fists on the floor, shook a fist toward heaven, confessed and reconfessed every sin. He recited every promise in the Bible as if God needed a reminder.\nOur passionate prayers move the heart of God. “The prayer of a person living right with God is something powerful to be reckoned with” (James 5:16\nMSG). Prayer does not change God’s nature. Prayer does, however, impact the flow of history. God has wired his world for power, but he calls on us to flip the switch. ',
