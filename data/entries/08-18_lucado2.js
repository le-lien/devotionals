Will standing beneath the downpour of his grace change the way we feel about others?\nPaul says absolutely! It’s not enough to keep the bad stuff out. We’ve got to let the good stuff in. It’s not enough to keep no list of wrongs. We have to cultivate a list of blessings: “Whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is gracious, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.” Thinking conveys the idea of pondering— studying and focusing, allowing what is viewed to have an impact on us.\nRather than store up the sour, store up the sweet.
