And don’t listen to people who promise that happiness is in having the right friends, the right clothes, or the right house. Happiness is not just a puppy away.\nTry this. Imagine a perfect world. Whatever that means to you, imagine it. Does that mean peace? Then imagine the place where you feel safest.\nDoes it mean perfect joy? Then imagine your greatest happiness. Is there love in your perfect world? Then imagine a place where everyone is completely loved. Whatever heaven means to you, imagine it. Get a good picture in your mind.\nAnd then smile as God reminds you that “no one has ever imagined what God has prepared for those who love him” (1 Corinthians 2:9).\nWhen it comes to heaven, you can’t begin to imagine how wonderful it will be.
