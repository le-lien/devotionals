    "body": 'The State of Texas is rebuilding a highway overpass near my house. Three lanes have been reduced to one, transforming a morning commute into a daily stew. Cranes daily hover overhead. Workers hold signs and shovels, and several million of us grumble. Well, at least I do. How long is this going to last?\nMy next-door neighbors have a different attitude toward the project. The husband and his wife are highway engineers. They endure the same traffic jams and detours as the rest of us, but do so with a better attitude. Why? They know how these projects develop. “It will take time,” they respond to my grumbles, “but it will get finished.” They’ve seen the plans.\nAs you honor workers on Labor Day, also honor God for his work in your life. His plans for you are grander than any highway project. “My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I too am working” (John 5:17 NIV).\nIt will take time. But it will get finished.\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
