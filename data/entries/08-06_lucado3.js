    "body": 'Jesus created what we might call the Society of the Second Mile. He presented a new option. Serve the ones who hate you; forgive the ones who hurt you. Take the lowest place, not the highest; seek to serve, not to be served. Retaliate, not in kind, but in kindness.\nRoman soldiers could legally force Jewish citizens into carrying a soldier’s load for one mile. 7 With nothing more than a command, the soldiers could pull a farmer out of his field or a merchant out of his shop.\nIn such a case, Jesus said, “Give more than requested.” At the end of one mile, keep going. Surprise the sandals off the soldier by saying, “I haven’t done enough for you. I’m going a second mile.” Do more than demanded.\nAnd do so with joy and grace!\nHow can you join the Society of the Second Mile? When your parents ask you to clean the kitchen, pick up your bedroom too. When your sister steals your best T-shirt, offer her two more. You’ll shock them. You’ll make Jesus smile. ',

      "text": 'Going a second mile might sound like a grim assignment. It isn’t. The more you do it, the more you’ll enjoy the surprised reactions of those you unexpectedly serve. More important, each mile will warm your own heart and move you a little closer to Jesus.'
