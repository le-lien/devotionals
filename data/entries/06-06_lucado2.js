How can you share grace if you are full of guilt? How can you offer comfort if you are disheartened? How can you lift someone else’s load if your arms are full with your own?\nFor the sake of those you love, travel light.\nFor the sake of the God you serve, travel light.\nFor the sake of your own joy, travel light.\nThere are certain weights in life you simply cannot carry. Your Lord is asking you to set them down and trust him. ',
