    "body": 'In this world, some people will try to get you to go a different way. A way that doesn’t include God. Sometimes those people are on TV. Sometimes their messages are in the songs you listen to. Sometimes they are sitting right next to you at the lunch table.\nThey will tell you to swap your honesty for a good grade on a test. They will tell you it’s okay to wear clothes that show too much. They will tell you it’s okay to make fun of others if it makes you look good. They will even tell you it’s okay to turn away from God in order to be more popular.\nThey will whisper, tease, and torment. “Go ahead. It’s okay,” they say.\n“Don’t worry. No one will know.”\nWhen some people tempt and tease you to do wrong, remember what God says: “Be careful. Continue strong in the faith … and be strong” (1\nCorinthians 16:13). God will give you the strength to stand strong against\n“some people.” ',
