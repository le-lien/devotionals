    "body": 'To pray “Your will be done” is to search for what God wants for you in your life. The word will  means “strong desire.” So what is  God’s strong desire for your life? What is His will? What is His heart’s greatest hope? It’s no secret. God’s greatest desire is to save you. God doesn’t hide what He is going to do. In fact, He has gone to a lot of trouble to show us His will. He sent His Son to lead us. He gave us His Word to teach us. And He sent His Holy Spirit to guide us. He even placed the stars in the heavens to prove to us that He is real.\nGod is not the God of confusion or doubt. Wherever He sees someone who is truly seeking Him, whenever He knows someone’s heart is filled with questions, God is there. And you can bet He is doing whatever it takes to help that person see His will. Because when you look for God, He lets you find Him. ',

      "text": 'God’s will can be wrapped up in two commands: “Love the Lord your God. Love him with all your heart, all your soul, all your strength, and all your mind” and also “You must love your neighbor as you love yourself” (Luke 10:27). Do these two things, and you’ll always be doing the will of God.'
