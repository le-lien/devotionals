    "body": 'Every Christmas I read this reminder from Roy Lessin that came in the mail several years ago:\n“If our greatest need had been information, God would have sent an educator. If our greatest need had been technology, God would have sent us a scientist. If our greatest need had been money, God would have sent us an economist. But since our greatest need was forgiveness, God sent us a Savior.”\nDo Christmas card messages strike you as corny? Maybe they are. Yet their simple phrases can cut through the chaos and capture the reason for the season. God knew what we needed. He became like us so that we could become like him. Angels still sing and the star still signals us to come closer.\nAnd he still loves each one of us like there was only one of us to love. ',
