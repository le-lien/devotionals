Not our strength.\nSalvation is God’s sudden, calming presence during the stormy seas of our lives. We hear his voice; we take the step.\nWe, like Paul, are aware of two things: We are great sinners and we need a great savior.\nWe, like Peter, are aware of two facts: We are going down and God is standing up. So we … leave behind the Titanic  of self-righteousness and stand on the solid path of God’s grace.\nAnd, surprisingly, we are able to walk on water. Death is disarmed.\nFailures are forgivable. Life has real purpose. And God is not only within sight, he is within reach. ',
