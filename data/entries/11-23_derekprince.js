    "body": 'Whenever I have conducted a healing service, I have usually required the people to make the above confession, because it would qualify them for healing. Let me explain. If you have a problem in your kidneys, then you would confess, “Jesus Himself [remember, the emphasis is on Him] took my infirmities and bore my sicknesses; with His wounds, I am healed.” Afterward, if you still have the problem in your kidneys, what do you do? Hold fast your confession. Do you still have the problem in your kidneys? Hold fast your confession without wavering. This is a battle. Believe me, I know from experience that pressing your way into healing can be a tremendous battle.\nThe writer of Hebrews said to the Hebrew Christians, “You have not yet resisted to bloodshed, striving against sin”  (Hebrews 12:4). We are used to the idea that we have to strive against sin, but we sometimes forget that we have to strive against sickness, too. We must fight. We are soldiers. We do not lie down and let the devil walk over us, for easy surrender does not give glory to God.\nIn regard to holding fast our confession without wavering, let us not focus exclusively on physical healing, even though the need for it is something that touches almost all people. What about financial needs?\nFor me—and this is not just a ritual—holding fast my confession is my way to release the treasures that God has in His storehouse for my ministry. God spoke to me and told me that He had made full provision for everything He would ask us to do. But to obtain the full provision, we had to believe and confess. And I make it personal. This confession is taken from 2 Corinthians 9:8: “God is able to make all grace abound toward [us],  that [we],  always having all sufficiency in all things, may have an abundance for every good work.”  Glory to God!
