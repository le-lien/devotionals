You can’t come to God on Sunday morning and say, “Okay, I’ve been nice to fifteen people this week, obeyed my parents twenty-one times, and done twelve good deeds.\nI’ll trade You all that for one ticket to heaven.”\nSounds silly, doesn’t it? That’s because it is silly. You can’t trade your good works for His salvation. Yes, God wants you to do good things, but the truth is you can never do enough  good things to trade your way into heaven.\nWhat does  get you into heaven? The apostle Paul answered that question:\n“You have been saved by grace because you believe. You did not save yourselves. It was a gift from God. You cannot brag that you are saved by the work you have done” (Ephesians 2:8–9). Heaven is God’s gift to those who believe  that His grace will get them there. ',
