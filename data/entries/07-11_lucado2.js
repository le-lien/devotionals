    "body": 'The most notorious road in the world is the Via Dolorosa, “the Way of Sorrows.” According to tradition, it is the route Jesus took from Pilate’s hall to Calvary. The path is marked by stations frequently used by Christians for their devotions. One station marks the passing of Pilate’s verdict. Another, the appearance of Simon to carry the cross. There are fourteen stations in all, each one a reminder of the events of Christ’s final journey.\nIs the route accurate? Probably not. . . . No one knows the exact route Christ followed that Friday.\nBut we do know where the path actually began.\nThe path began, not in the court of Pilate, but in the halls of heaven. The Father began his journey when he left his home in search of us. . . . His desire was singular—to bring his children home… .\nThe path to the cross tells us exactly how far God will go to call us back. ',
