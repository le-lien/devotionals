    "body": 'The night that Jesus was arrested, there were many people gathered at Gethsemane. Judas with his kiss of betrayal. Peter with his sword. The soldiers with their weapons. And though these are important, they aren’t the most important. The true battle is not between Jesus and the soldiers; it is between God and Satan. Satan has dared to enter yet another garden—the Garden of Gethsemane this time—just as he did in Eden. But God stands up to him, and Satan doesn’t have a chance.\nThere in Gethsemane, Jesus speaks just three simple words—“I am Jesus”—and sends both the devil and members of the world’s finest army falling to the ground (John 18:5–6). Neither Satan nor those who do his will can stand before Christ.\nWhen Jesus says He will keep you safe, He means it. The devil will have to get through Him to get to you. Jesus is able to protect you. When He says He will get you home to heaven, He will get you home. ',
