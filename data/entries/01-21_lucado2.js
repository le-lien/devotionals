    "body": 'God never gives up.\nWhen Joseph was dropped into a pit by his own brothers, God didn’t give up.\nWhen Moses said, “Here I am, send Aaron,” God didn’t give up.\nWhen the delivered Israelites wanted Egyptian slavery instead of milk and honey, God didn’t give up.\nWhen Peter worshiped him at the supper and cursed him at the fire, he didn’t give up.\nAnd when human hands fastened the divine hands to a cross with spikes, it wasn’t the soldiers who held the hands of Jesus steady. It was God who held them steady. God, who would give up his only son before he’d give up on you. ',
