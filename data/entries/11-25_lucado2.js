Your Bible overflows with examples of those who did.\nIn his gospel, Matthew mentions his own name only twice. Both times he calls himself a tax collector. In his list of apostles, he assigns himself the eighth spot.\nJohn doesn’t even mention his name in his gospel. The twenty appearances of “John” all refer to the Baptist. John the apostle simply calls himself “the other disciple” or the “disciple whom Jesus loved.”\nLuke wrote two of the most important books in the Bible but never once penned his own name. ',
