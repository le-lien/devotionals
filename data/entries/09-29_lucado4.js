They believed that if Jesus had been only a man, He would have stayed in the tomb. These early Christians just couldn’t stay silent about the fact that the One they saw die on a cross walked again on the earth and was seen by five hundred people. ',

Let us see the victorious Jesus: the One who defeated the tomb and defeated death. And let us also remember that we, too, will one day be given that same victory. One day, we will defeat the tomb and defeat death.',
      "text": 'Growing in Grace Read the Gospels’ reports of the times Jesus was seen after He left the tomb. (Find these in Matthew 28:1–20, Mark 16:9–20, Luke 24:13–53, and John 20:11–29.) Count how many different people saw the risen Jesus and how many of them were willing to suffer beatings and prison to tell others what they had seen.'
