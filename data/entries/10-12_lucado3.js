    "body": 'Joseph had a jealousy problem. Not his, but the jealousy of his ten older brothers. Their father pampered Joseph like a prized calf. The brothers worked all day. Joseph played all day. They wore clothes from a secondhand store. Jacob gave Joseph a hand-stitched, multicolored cloak with embroidered sleeves. Jacob treated the eleventh-born like a firstborn. The brothers spat at the sight of Joseph.\nThe brothers dealt with their jealousy by selling Joseph into slavery. Not the best solution. Joseph rose to power in Egypt and threw his brothers into prison for a time.\nActing out on your envy isn’t the best solution for you either. Do your parents treat little sister Cindy Lou better than you? Does a friend own a better car? Does another friend get all the guys? Getting mad at your parents or your friends won’t help. Giving in to jealousy ruins relationships and robs you of joy. It’s better when you focus on what you have instead of what you want. God’s already given you what you need. ',

      "text": 'If we’re feeling jealous, that’s an air-raid warning. Our mind is saying, “I want more for me.” Can’t we be happy for whatever blessings God has given someone else? Don’t be a slave to envy. Live with a thankful heart. That’s freedom.'
