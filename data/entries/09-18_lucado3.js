    "body": 'Aminister invited me to his house for high tea. I had never heard of it. In the spirit of adventure, I gladly accepted the invitation. I even acted enthused at the sight of the tea and cookie tray. But then came the moment of truth: the hostess asked what I would like in my tea. She offered two options.\n“Lemon? Milk?” I had no clue, but I didn’t want to be rude, and I sure didn’t want to miss out on anything so I said, “Both.”\nThe look on her face left no question: I’d goofed. “You don’t mix lemon and milk in the same cup,” she softly explained, “unless you want a cup of curdle.”\nSome of us try so hard to fit in this world, but we end up simply looking foolish. Jesus says that if we’re believers, we shouldn’t try. “They are not of the world any more than I am of the world” (John 17:14 NIV). If our goal is to fit in with God, we won’t miss a thing. ',
