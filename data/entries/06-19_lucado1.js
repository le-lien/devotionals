Here are a few ideas: Give God your waking thoughts.  Before you face the day, face the Father.\nBefore you step out of bed, step into his presence.\nGive God your waiting thoughts.  Spend time with him in silence.\nGive God your whispering thoughts. . . . Imagine considering every moment as a potential time of communion with God.\nGive God your waning thoughts. At the end of the day, let your mind settle on him. Conclude the day as you began it: talking to God. ',
