    "body": 'Ihad never thought much about the courtesy of Christ before, but as I began looking, I realized that in the art of being a gentleman, Jesus is the grand master.\nHe always knocks before entering. He doesn’t have to. He owns your heart. If anyone has the right to barge in, Christ does. But he doesn’t. That quiet tap you hear? It’s Christ. “Behold, I stand at the door and knock”\n(Revelation 3:20 NASB). And when you answer, he awaits your invitation to cross the threshold.\nAnd when he enters, he always brings a gift. Some bring chocolate and daisies. Christ brings “the gift of the Holy Spirit” (Acts 2:38). And, as he stays, he serves. “For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve” (Mark 10:45 NIV). If you’re missing your apron, you’ll find it on him.\nHe’s serving the guests as they sit (John 13:4–5). He won’t eat until he has offered thanks, and he won’t leave until the leftovers are put away (Matthew 14:19–20). ',

His words contain truth that echoes throughout time, yet it is his loving acts that provide our model. He is courteous. He is kind. He serves. He is a gentleman.'
