    "body": 'If you look hard enough and long enough, you’ll find something to complain about. Adam and Eve did. Surrounded by all they needed, they set their eyes on the one thing they couldn’t have—forbidden fruit. They found something to complain about.\nWhat about you? What are you looking at? The one fruit you can’t eat?\nOr the million you can? His plan or your problems? Each a gift or a grind?\nAnd now, dear brothers and sisters, one final thing. Fix your thoughts on what is true, and honorable, and right, and pure, and lovely, and admirable. Think about things that are excellent and worthy of praise. (Philippians 4:8 NLT)\nWhen we see as God wants us to see, we see heaven’s hand in the middle of sickness, the Holy Spirit comforting a broken heart. We see not what is seen, but what is unseen. We see with faith and not flesh, and since faith leads to hope, we of all people are hope filled. For we know there is more to life than what meets the eye. ',
