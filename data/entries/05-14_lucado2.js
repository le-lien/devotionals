    "body": 'Should a man see only popularity, he becomes a mirror, reflecting whatever needs to be reflected to gain acceptance. Though in vogue, he is vague. Though in style, he is stodgy… .\nShould a man see only power, he becomes a wolf—prowling, hunting, and stalking the elusive game. Recognition is his prey and people are his prizes. His quest is endless… .\nShould a man see only pleasure, he becomes a carnival thrill-seeker, alive only in bright lights, wild rides, and titillating entertainment. With lustful fever he races from ride to ride, satisfying his insatiable passion for sensations only long enough to look for another… .\nSeekers of popularity, power, and pleasure. The end result is the same: painful unfulfillment.\nOnly in seeing his Maker does a man truly become man. For in seeing his Creator, man catches a glimpse of what he was intended to be. ',
