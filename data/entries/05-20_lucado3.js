    "body": 'Do you have heart trouble? Is yours filled with anger and anxiety? Jesus is your cure.\nHis heart was pure. The Savior was adored by thousands, yet content to live a simple life. He was cared for by women (Luke 8:1–3), yet never accused of lustful thoughts; rejected by the people he created, but willing to forgive them before they even asked. Peter, who traveled with Jesus for three and a half years, described him as a “pure and perfect lamb” (1 Peter 1:19\nNCV).\nHis heart was peaceful. The disciples fretted over the need to feed thousands, but not Jesus. He thanked God for the problem. The disciples shouted for fear in the storm, but not Jesus. He slept through it. Peter drew his sword to fight soldiers coming for his master. Not Jesus. He lifted his hand to heal. His heart was at peace.\nYou too can know purity and peace. Allow Jesus into your heart. He’s the surgeon-Savior who knows just what to do. ',
