All God’s children.\nAnd he wants us so badly, he’ll take us in any condition—“as is” reads the tag on our collars. He’s not about to wait for us to reach perfection (he knows we’ll never get there!). Do you think he’s waiting for us to overcome all temptations? Hardly. When we master the Christian walk? Far from it.\nRemember, Christ died for us when we were still sinners. His sacrifice, then, was not dependent on our performance.\nHe wants us now. ',
