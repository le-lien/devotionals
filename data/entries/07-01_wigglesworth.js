    "body": 'ou are bound forever out of loyalty to God to see that no division comes into the church body, to see that nothing comes Y into the assembly, as it came into David‘s flock, to tear and rend the body. You have to be careful. If a person comes along with a prophecy and you find that it is tearing down and bringing trouble, denounce it accordingly; judge it by the Word. You will find that all true prophecy will be perfectly full of hopefulness. It will have compassion; it will have comfort; it will have edification. So if anything comes into the church that you know is hurting the flock and disturbing the assembly, you must see to it that you begin to pray so that this thing is put to death.\n\nBring unity in the bonds of perfection so that the church of God will receive edification. Then the church will begin to be built up in the faith and the establishing of truth, and believers will be one. There is one body. Recognize that fact. When schism comes into the body, believers always act as though there were more than one body.\n\nDo not forget that God means for us to be very faithful to the church so that we do not allow anything to come into the church to break up the body. You cannot find anything in the body in its relation to Christ that has schism in it. Christ‘s life in the body—there is no schism in that. When Christ‘s life comes into the church, there will be no discord; there will be a perfect blending of heart and hand, and it will be lovely. Endeavor “to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.”',
