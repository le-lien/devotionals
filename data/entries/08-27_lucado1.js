Verbs. Nouns. Sentences.\nLessons. The same equipment you and I have… .\nWas it easier then than now? Don’t think so. Paul called it work. To this end I labor, he wrote. Labor means work. Work means homes visited, people taught, classes prepared.\nHow did he do it? What was his source of strength? He worked with all the energy he so powerfully works in me.\nAs Paul worked, so did God… . And as you work, so does the Father. ',
