    "body": 'God gave us the Bible so that He could tell us His plan for us.\nThe Bible tells us that we are all lost and need to be saved. And it tells us that Jesus is God in human form and that He was sent to save God’s children.\nThe Bible was written by at least forty different authors spread out over sixteen hundred years. But it has just one message: salvation comes through faith in Jesus. The first words of the Bible were written by Moses in the lonely desert of Arabia, and the last words were written by John on the lonely island of Patmos. Yet one thread holds the whole Bible together: God’s love for His children and God’s plan to save them.\nThe Bible is like your compass for your journey through life. Check your compass, and you’ll journey safely. Forget to use your compass—forget to study your Bible—and who knows where you’ll end up. ',
