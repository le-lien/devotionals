You should wait for the day of God and look forward to its coming” (2 Peter 3:11–12).\nThe hope of heaven in the future, though, does not give us the right to do whatever we want today. We should be holy and wait for the Lord.\nWe wait on a lot things. We wait in line, in class, in the car—and we wait expecting  our wait to end. But how are we waiting for Jesus? Are we expecting our wait for Him to end? Are we looking for Him? Too often we are content to just wait, and we forget to expect. We don’t let the Holy Spirit change our plans. We don’t let Him lead us to worship so that we might see Jesus. We are waiting, but we are not expecting. ',

Deciding which way to go. You’re waiting, but you’re waiting busily. Wait for Jesus busily too. Pray. Study. Teach. Get ready.'
