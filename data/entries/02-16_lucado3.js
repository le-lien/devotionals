    "body": 'John the Baptist would never get hired to preach today. No church would touch him. He was a public relations disaster. He “wore clothes made from camel’s hair, had a leather belt around his waist, and ate locusts and wild honey” (Mark 1:6 NCV). Who would want to look at a guy like that every Sunday?\nHis message was as rough as his dress: a no-nonsense, barefisted challenge to repent because God was on his way. John the Baptist set himself apart for one task: to be a voice of Christ. Everything about John centered on his purpose. His dress. His diet. His actions. His demands.\nYou don’t have to be like the world to have an impact on the world. You don’t have to be like the crowd to change the crowd. You don’t have to lower yourself down to their level to lift them up to your level. Holiness doesn’t seek to be odd. Holiness seeks to be like God. ',

But should you fit in? John the Baptist didn’t. He cared only about serving and being like God. Don’t be afraid to be set apart.'
