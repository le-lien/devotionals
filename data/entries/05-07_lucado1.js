    "body": 'Do we ever compromise tonight, knowing we’ll confess tomorrow?\nIt’s easy to be like the fellow visiting Las Vegas who called the preacher, wanting to know the hours of the Sunday service. The preacher was impressed. “Most people who come to Las Vegas don’t do so to go to church.”\n“Oh, I’m not coming for the church. I’m coming for the gambling and parties and wild women. If I have half as much fun as I intend to, I’ll need a church come Sunday morning.”\nIs that the intent of grace? Is God’s goal to promote disobedience?\nHardly. “Grace . . . teaches us not to live against God nor to do the evil things the world wants us to do. Instead, that grace teaches us to live now in a wise and right way and in a way that shows we serve God” (Titus 2:11–\n12). God’s grace has released us from selfishness. Why return? ',
