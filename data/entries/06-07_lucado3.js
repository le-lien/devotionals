It can leave your head spinning faster than a jet-powered merry-go-round. You start wondering, Just who am I?\nLet me tell you who you are. In fact, let me proclaim who you are. You are part of God’s family and will inherit his kingdom with Christ (Romans 8:17). You are eternal, like an angel (Luke 20:36). You have a crown that will last forever (1 Corinthians 9:25). You are a holy priest (1 Peter 2:5), a treasured possession (Exodus 19:5).\nBut more than any of the above—more significant than any title or position—is the simple fact that you are God’s child. “We really are his children” (1 John 3:1 NCV). As a result, if something is important to you, it’s important to God. You belong to him.\nONE MORE THOUGHT\nWe have so many roles to play. Son or daughter. Brother or sister. Student. ',
