    "body": 'The Holy Spirit has a royal plan, a heavenly plan. He came to unveil the King, to show the character of God, to unveil the T precious blood. Since I have the Holy Spirit within me, I see Jesus clothed for humanity. He was moved by the Spirit and led by the Spirit. We read of some who heard the Word but did not benefit from it, because faith was lacking in them (Rom. 9:6–8). We must have a living faith in God‘s Word, a faith that is quickened by the Spirit.\n\nA man may be saved and still have a human spirit. In many people who hear about the baptism of the Holy Spirit, the human spirit immediately arises against the Holy Spirit. The human spirit is not subject to the law of God, nor can it be. (See Romans 8:7.) The disciples at one time wanted to call down fire from heaven, and Jesus said to them, “You do not know what manner of spirit you are of”  (Luke 9:55). The human spirit is not subject to the law of God.\n\nThe Holy Spirit came forth for one purpose: to reveal Jesus to us. Jesus  “made Himself of no reputation”  (Phil. 2:7), and He was obedient unto death (v. 8), that God should forever hold Him up as a token of submissive yieldedness. God highly exalted Him and gave Him a name above every name. “Now He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who also has given us the Spirit as a guarantee”  (2 Cor. 5:5). With the clothing upon of the Spirit, human depravity is covered, and everything that is contrary to the mind of God is destroyed. God must have bodies for Himself, perfectly prepared by the Holy Spirit, for the Day of the Lord. “For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven”  (v. 2).\n\nWas Paul speaking here about the coming of the Lord? No! Yet this condition of preparedness is highly relevant. The Holy Spirit is coming to take back a church and a perfect bride. The Holy Spirit must find in us perfect yieldedness, with every human desire subjected to Him. “No one can say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit”  (1 Cor. 12:3). He has come to reveal Christ in us, so that the glorious flow of the life of God may bring rivers of living water to the thirsty land within.\n\nThe Spirit has to breathe into us a new occupancy, a new order. The Holy Spirit came to give the vision of a life in which Jesus is perfected. It is Christ “who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace”  (2 Tim. 1:9).\n\nWe who are saved have been called with a holy calling, called to be saints—to be pure, holy, and Godlike; to be sons with power. It is a long time now since it was settled and death was abolished. Death has no more power. This was made known through the Gospel, which brought in immortality. Mortality is a hindrance. Sin has no more dominion over you. You reign in Christ, and you make rightful use of His finished work. Don‘t groan and travail for a week. If you are in need, “only believe”  (Mark 5:36). Don‘t fast to get some special thing, “only believe.”  It is according to your faith that God blesses you with more faith. “Have faith in God” (Mark 11:22). If you are free in God, believe! Believe, and it will be unto you even as you believe. (See Matthew 9:29.)\n\n“Awake, you who sleep” (Eph. 5:14); put on light, and open your eyes. “If then you were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God” (Col. 3:1). Stir yourselves up, beloved! Where are you? I am risen with Christ, planted in Him. It was a beautiful planting. I am seated with Him. God gives me the credit, and I believe Him. Why should I doubt?\n\nDare to believe until the life of Jesus is implanted within your soul. “The righteous will hold to his way”  (Job 17:9). God has reserved him who is godly for Himself (Ps. 4:3). Therefore, lift up your heads.',
