    "body": 'Those who don’t believe in Jesus notice what we do. They make decisions about Christ by watching us. When we are kind, they assume Christ is kind. When we are gracious, they assume Christ is gracious.\nBut if we are arrogant or pushy, what will people think about our King?\nWhen we are dishonest, what assumption will an observer make about our Master? No wonder Paul says, “Be wise in the way you act with people who are not believers, making the most of every opportunity. When you talk, you should always be kind and pleasant so you will be able to answer everyone in the way you should” (Colossians 4:5–6 NCV). Courteous conduct honors Christ.\nIt also honors his children. When you surrender a place in line to someone, you honor him. When you return a borrowed book, you honor the lender. When you make an effort to greet everyone in the room, especially the ones others may have overlooked, you honor God’s children. ',
