What if parents could do this with kids? “I’ll take a plate of good grades and cute smiles, and I’m passing on the teenage identity crisis and tuition bills.”\nWhat if kids could do the same with parents? “Please give me a helping of allowances and free lodging but no rules or curfews, thank you.”\nAnd spouse with spouse? “H’m, how about a bowl of good health and good moods. But job transfers, in-laws, and laundry are not on my diet.”\nWouldn’t it be great if love were like a cafeteria line? It would be easier.\nIt would be neater. It would be painless and peaceful. But you know what?\nIt wouldn’t be love. Love doesn’t accept just a few things. Love is willing to accept all things. ',
