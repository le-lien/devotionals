You have to stretch your legs as far as they will go to reach his footprints!\nBut by following in his footprints, you know which way to go. That’s what following God is like. It’s called discipleship.\nAs a Christian, you need to follow in someone else’s footprints. A parent, grandparent, or teacher. That person’s footprints show you the right way to go, what to say and do as a child of God. No one has to walk this path alone. ',

      "text": 'Growing in Grace Trace around your feet on a piece of construction paper, and then cut out the footprints. Ask your mom or dad to do the same. Which ones are bigger? The feet of the grown-ups are—they’ve been growing longer. Your faith should be the same way. The longer it grows, the bigger your “faith footprint” will be.'
