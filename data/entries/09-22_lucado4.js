    "body": 'Faith often begins with fear. Look at some of God’s greatest heroes: Peter feared death and ran away. Gideon feared defeat and hid. Moses feared failure and begged God to choose someone else.\nBut faith begins when you are in the valley of fear and you look up to see God on the mountaintop. You see what you need—God. You see what you have—your own fears and limited abilities. And you know that you can’t save yourself.\nMoses had the Red Sea in front of him and an army of Egyptian enemies behind. The Israelites could swim or they could fight. But neither choice was enough to save them.\nPaul was a master of the Jewish laws. But one glimpse of Jesus on the road to Damascus proved that it didn’t matter how much he knew. It would never be enough. ',
