    "body": 'ow I will deal with the gift itself. It is actually "gifts" of healing, not the "gift" of healing. Gifts of healing can deal N with every case of sickness, every disease that there is. These gifts are so full that they are beyond human expression, but you come into the fullness of them as the light brings revelation to you.\n\nI have people continually coming to me and saying, "When you are preaching, I see a halo around you," or "When you are preaching, I have seen angels standing around you."\n\nI hear these things from time to time, and I am thankful that people have such spiritual vision. I do not have that kind of vision; however, I have the express glory, the glory of the Lord, covering me, the intense inner working of His power, until every time I have stood before you, I have known that I have not had to choose the words I have spoken. The language has been chosen, the thoughts have been chosen, and I have been speaking in prophecy more than in any other way. So I know we have been in the school of the Holy Spirit in a great way.\n\nThe only vision I have had in a divine healing meeting is this: so often, when I have laid hands upon the people, I have seen two hands go before my hands. This has happened many, many times.\n\nThe person who has the gifts of healing does not look to see what is happening. You will notice that after I have finished ministering, many things are manifested, but they don‘t move me. I am not moved by anything I see.\n\nThe divine gifts of healing are so profound in the person who has them that there is no such thing as doubt, and there could not be; whatever happens could not change the person‘s opinion or thought or act. He expects the very thing that God intends him to have as he lays hands upon the seeker.\n\nWherever I go, the manifestation of divine healing is consider-ably greater after I leave than when I am there. Why? It is God‘s plan for me. God has great grace over me. Wonderful things have 479\n\nbeen accomplished, and people have told me what happened when I was there, but these things were hidden from me. God has a reason why He hides things from me.\n\nWhen I lay hands upon people for a specific thing, I tell you, that thing will take place. I believe it will be so, and I never turn my ears or my eyes from the fact. It has to be so.\n\nThe gifts of divine healing are more than audacity; they are more than an unction. Those are two big things; however, the gifts of healing are the solid fact of a divine nature within the person pressing forward the very nature and activity of the Lord, as if He were there. We are in this place to glorify the Father, and the Father will be glorified in the Son since we are not afraid of taking action in this day.\n\nThe gifts of healing are a fact. They are a production; they are a faith; they are an unwavering trust; they are a confidence; they are a reliability.\n\nPeople sometimes come to me very troubled. They say, "I had the gifts of healing once, but something has happened and I do not have them now."\n\nThey never had them. “The gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable”  (Rom. 11:29), and they remain under every circumstance except this: if you fall from grace and use a gift, it will work against you. If you use tongues out of the will of God, interpretation will condemn you. If you have been used and the gift has been exercised and then you have fallen from your high place, it will work against you.',
