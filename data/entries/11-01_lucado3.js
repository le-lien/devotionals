Maybe a few drips here and there. A leaky underground faucet or a gentle rain on a peaceful night. Slowly more and more water built up. Thunderstorms. Lightning. Angry expressions from the sky spilling out in the raging river called the Colorado, carving a crevasse.\nOur anger builds like the Colorado. Slowly, small things drip down, annoying, irritating, finally enraging. Get out of my way!  Drip. You do this all the time!  Drip. Don’t tell me what to do!  Drip. The pressure and the buildup explodes, unleashing a frenzy of anger, pouring out in words, sweeping away our friends, our family, our peace.\nDon’t wait until you have a roaring river. Go after the small drips.\nAddress every little irritant with forgiveness and prayer. Do it before anger digs a canyon in your life … with you on one side and everyone you know on the other. ',
