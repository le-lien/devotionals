The babe of Bethlehem. Immanuel. Remember the promise of the angel? “‘Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel,’ which is translated, ‘God with us’” (Matt. 1:23 NKJV).\nImmanuel. The name appears in the same Hebrew form as it did two thousand years ago. “Immanu” means “with us.” “El” refers to Elohim, or God. Not an “above us God” or a “somewhere in the neighborhood God.”\nHe came as the “with us God.” God with us.\nNot “God with the rich” or “God with the religious.” But God with us.\nAll of us. Russians, Germans, Buddhists, Mormons, truckdrivers and taxi drivers, librarians. God with us. ',
