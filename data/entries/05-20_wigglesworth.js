    "body": 'raising God in a meeting is a different thing than thanking Him for the trials you face in your life. There must be no P perishing though we are tried by fire. What is going to appear at the appearing of Jesus? Faith! Your heart will be established by the grace of the Spirit, which doesn‘t crush, but refines; doesn‘t destroy, but enlarges. Oh, beloved, the Enemy is a defeated foe, and Jesus not only conquers but also displays the spoils of His conquest. The pure in heart will see God (Matt. 5:8). “If therefore your eye is good, your whole body will be full of light”  (Matt. 6:22).\n\nWhat is it? It is loyalty to the Word by the power of the blood. You know your inheritance within you is more powerful than all that is without. How many have gone to the stake and through fiery persecution? Did they desire it? Faith tried by fire had power to stand all ridicule, all slander. We need to have the faith of the Son of God, “who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross”  (Heb. 12:2). Oh, the joy of pleasing Him!\n\nNo trial, no darkness, nothing is too hard for me. If only I may see the image of my Lord again and again. In the melting pot, He removes the skimmings until His face is seen. When the metal reflects Him, it is pure. Who is looking into our hearts? Who is the Refiner? My Lord. He will remove only what will hinder. Oh, I know the love of God is working in my heart.',
