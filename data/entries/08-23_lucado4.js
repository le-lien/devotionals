Not looking brighter. God doesn’t just improve; He perfects. He doesn’t make better; He completes.\nNow I know that in one way we’re not perfect. We still make mistakes.\nWe still mess up. We still do exactly what we don’t want to do, what we’re trying so hard not to do. And that part of us is the part that God says is\n“being made holy.” ',
