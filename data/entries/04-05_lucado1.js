    "body": 'Worship. In two thousand years we haven’t worked out the kinks.\nWe still struggle for the right words in prayer. We still fumble over Scripture. We don’t know when to kneel. We don’t know when to stand. We don’t know how to pray.\nWorship is a daunting task.\nFor that reason, God gave us the Psalms—a praise book for God’s people. . . . This collection of hymns and petitions are strung together by one thread—a heart hungry for God.\nSome are defiant. Others are reverent. Some are to be sung. Others are to be prayed. Some are intensely personal. Others are written as if the whole world would use them … .\nThe very variety should remind us that worship is personal. No secret formula exists. What moves you may stymie another. Each worships differently. But each should worship. ',
