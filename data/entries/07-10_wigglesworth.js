    "body": 'll was made by the Word. I am begotten by His Word. There is a substance within me that has almighty power in A it if I dare to believe. Faith goes on to be an act, a reality, a deposit of God, an almighty flame moving me to act, so that signs and wonders are manifested.\n\nAre you begotten? Is faith an act within you? Some need a touch; some are captives and need liberty. As many as Jesus touched were made perfectly whole. Faith takes you to the place where God reigns, and you drink from God‘s bountiful store. Unbelief is sin, for Jesus went to death to bring us the light of life.\n\nHis life is manifested power overflowing. We must decrease if the life of God is to be manifested. (See John 3:30.) There is not room for two kinds of life in one body. Death for life—that is the price to pay for the manifested power of God through you. As you die to human desire, there comes a fellowship within, perfected cooperation, you ceasing, God increasing. God in you is a living substance, a spiritual nature. You live by another life, the “faith in the Son of God”  (Gal. 2:20).\n\nAs the Holy Spirit reveals Jesus, He is real—the living Word, effective, acting, speaking, thinking, praying, singing. Oh, it is a wonderful life, this substance of the Word of God, which includes possibility and opportunity, which confronts you, bringing you to a place undaunted. Jesus has given us power over all the power of the Enemy (Luke 10:19). He won it for us at Calvary. All must be subject to His power. What should we do to “work the works of God?”  (John 6:28). “This is the work of God, that you believe”  (v. 29). Whatsoever He says will come to pass. That is God‘s Word.\n\nWe must remain in a strong, resolute resting on the authority of God‘s Word. We must have one great desire and purpose: to do what He says. We must live in this holy Word, rejoicing in the manifestation of the life of God on behalf of the sick and perishing multitudes. Amen.',
