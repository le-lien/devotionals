    "body": 'e appreciate cathedrals and churches, but God does not dwell in temples made by hands but in the sanctuary of W the heart. (See Acts 7:48.) The Father seeks “true wor-shipers”  (John 4:23) who will   worship Him  “in spirit and truth.” The church is the body of Christ. Its worship is a heart worship, a longing to come into the presence of God. God sees our hearts and will open our understanding. The Lord delights in His people. He wants us to come to a place of undisturbed rest and peace that is found only in God. Only simplicity will bring us there.\n\nAs Jesus placed a little child in the middle of the disciples, He said, “Unless you are converted and become as little children, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven”  (Matt. 18:3). He did not mean that we should seek to have a child‘s mind, but a child‘s meek and gentle spirit. It is the only place to meet God. He will give us that place of worship.\n\nHow my heart cries out for a living faith and a deep vision of God. The world cannot produce it. It is a place where we see the Lord, a place where we pray and know that God hears. We can ask God and believe Him for the answer, having no fear but a living faith to come into the presence of God. “In [His] presence is fullness of joy; at [His] right hand are pleasures forevermore”  (Ps. 16:11).',
