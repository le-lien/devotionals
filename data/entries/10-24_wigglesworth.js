    "body": 'o be “complete”  means that you are not moved by anything, that you are living only in the divine position of God. It T means that you are not moved, that you are not changed by what people say. There is something about divine acquaintance that is instilled; it is worked within a person by the mighty God. It becomes like intuition.\n\nAccepting Christ as Savior builds the character of a person in purity until his inward heart is filled with divine love and has nothing but thoughts of God alone. “That you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing.”\n\nWhen I was in New Zealand, some people came to me and said, "We would like to give you a Christmas present, if you can tell us what you would like." "I haven‘t a desire in the world," I said. "I cannot tell you anything I would like. I have no desire for anything except God."\n\nOne day, I was walking down the street with a millionaire. I was feeling wonderfully happy over the way the Lord was blessing in our meetings. As we walked together, I said, "Brother, I haven‘t a care in the world. I am as happy as a bird!"\n\n"Oh!" he said. "Stop! Say it again! Say it again!" And he stood still, waiting for me to repeat it. "Brother, I haven‘t a care in the world. I am as happy as a bird!" He exclaimed, "I would give all my money, I would give everything I have, to have that!"\n\nTo be lacking nothing—hallelujah!\n\nThe Spirit of the Lord is moving us mightily to see that this is resurrection power. We were planted with Him, and we have been raised with Him (Rom. 6:5 KJV). We are from above (see Colossians 3:1–3); we do not belong to what is below. We “reign in life”  (Rom. 5:17) by Another. It is the life of God‘s Son manifested in this human body.',
