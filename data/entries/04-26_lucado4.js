    "body": 'Alegend from India tells about a mouse who was terrified of cats until a magician agreed to change him into a cat. That fixed his fear … until he met a dog. So the magician changed him into a dog. The mouse-turned-cat-turned-dog was happy . . . until he met a tiger. So, once again, the magician changed him into what he feared. But when the tiger came complaining that he had met a hunter, the magician would not help. “I will make you into a mouse again, for even though you have the body of a tiger, you still have the heart of a mouse.”\nLike that tiger, lots of people look big and tough on the outside, but inside they are trembling with fear. We fight our fears, and we try to make ourselves safe by wearing the right clothes, hanging out with the right friends, and having the right stuff. But does that really work? Are we any less frightened? ',
