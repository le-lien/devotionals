    "body": 'Because of Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross, our past sins are forgiven and our future in heaven is certain. “We have been made right with God because of our faith. So we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (Romans 5:1).\nPeace with God. What will that be like? Have you even been in a gym filled with people screaming for their favorite team? Or at a concert filled with loud music and loud fans? Or stuck between two people arguing at the top of their voices? And then … you stepped outside. Your heart stopped pounding, your breathing slowed. How quiet, how … peaceful.\nPeace with God will be a zillion times better than that. When you get to heaven, there will be no more screaming, loudness, or arguing. There will be only love and joy and peace. It will be better than peace between countries, better than peace between friends, and better than peace at home.\nWe will have peace with God. ',
