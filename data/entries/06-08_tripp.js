    "body": 'As I sat in the balcony with my wife Luella, I remembered how important and wonderful corporate worship is. It was Tenth Presbyterian Church’s Spring Choral Worship Service. It featured the original compositions and hymn arrangements of Robert Elmore. We were reminded in song of the miserable condition in which sin left us and our world, and of the glorious rescue of redeeming grace. Each piece was so full of the gospel that I felt as if my heart could not contain anything more. I was thinking of the words of Psalm 89:1: “I will sing of the steadfast love of the LORD, forever; with my mouth I will make known your faithfulness to all generations.” I thought we could sing and sing and sing and never exhaust the stunning redemptive themes of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.\nFinally, after a lavish gospel meal, the crescendo anthem came. It was such a beautiful celebration of the glory of the gospel that when we came to the last two lines, I quit singing and began to repeat over and over again: “Amen! Amen!\nAmen!” Corporate worship had performed its work in my heart once again.\nVery honestly, I hadn’t come to the service with a celebratory heart. I had grumbled my way into the room. It had been a long ministry weekend. I wouldn’t have gone to that Sunday evening service if Luella hadn’t begged me to. I really didn’t want to be there. But in the middle of it all, something captured my heart—glory. The glory of the grace of Jesus suddenly loomed larger than the exhaustion of my body or the weariness of my mind. My cold heart was enlivened by the fire of the gospel of the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. The talents of the musicians and the voices of the congregation reminded me once again of who I was and what I had been given in the grace of the cross of Jesus.\nOnce again, this grumbler became a celebrant. Once again, the gathering of God’s people for worship had done its job.\nGod ordained for us to gather for worship because he knows us and the weaknesses of our fickle, grumbling, and easily distracted hearts. He knows how soon we forget the depth of our need as sinners and the expansiveness of his\nprovisions in Jesus Christ. He knows that little lies can deceive us and little obstacles can discourage us. He knows that self-righteousness still has the power to delude us. So in grace he calls us to gather and consider glory once again, to be excited once again, and to be rescued once again. It’s not only that corporate worship reminds us of God’s grace. Corporate worship is itself a gift of grace.\nRun with celebration to its rescue any time it is available to you.',
