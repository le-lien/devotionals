AIDS\norphans need homes. Stressed-out executives need hope. God has work to do. And he uses our hands to do it.\nWhat the hand is to the glove, the Spirit is to the Christian… . God gets into us. At times, imperceptibly. Other times, disruptively. God gets his fingers into our lives, inch by inch reclaiming the territory that is rightfully his.\nYour tongue. He claims it for his message.\nYour feet. He requisitions them for his purpose.\nYour mind? He made it and intends to use it for his glory.\nYour eyes, face, and hands? Through them he will weep, smile, and touch. ',
