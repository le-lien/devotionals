Then he began to wash the disciples’ feet”\n(John 13:4–5 NLT).\nI don’t know about you, but if I knew I was about to die, my first thought wouldn’t be to grab soap, water, and someone’s ankle. I’m not even a fan of feet. Look you in the face? I will. Shake your hand? Gladly. Put an arm around your shoulders? Happy to do so. But rub feet? Come on. Feet smell bad and look ugly. Which, I believe, is the point of this story.\nJesus touched the stinky, ugly feet of his disciples. Knowing he came from God. Knowing he was going to God. Knowing that all authority was his, he exchanged his robe for the servant’s wrap, lowered himself to knee level, and began to rub away the grime, grit, and grunge their feet had collected on the journey.\nHe wants to wash away every dirty part of your life too.
