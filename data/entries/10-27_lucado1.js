    "body": 'God’s faithfulness has never depended on the faithfulness of his children. He is faithful even when we aren’t. When we lack courage, he doesn’t. He has made a history out of using people in spite of people.\nNeed an example? The feeding of the five thousand. It’s the only miracle, aside from those of the final week, recorded in all four Gospels. Why did all four writers think it worth repeating? … Perhaps they wanted to show how God doesn’t give up even when his people do… .\nWhen the disciples didn’t pray, Jesus prayed. When the disciples didn’t see God, Jesus sought God. When the disciples were weak, Jesus was strong. When the disciples had no faith, Jesus had faith.\nI simply think God is greater than our weakness. In fact, I think it is our weakness that reveals how great God is… .\nGod is faithful even when his children are not. ',
