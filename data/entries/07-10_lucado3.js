    "body": 'My friend and I went on a hill-country bicycle trek. A few minutes into the trip I began to tire. Within a half hour my thighs ached and my lungs heaved like a beached whale. I could scarcely pump the pedals. I’m no Tour de France contender, but neither am I a newcomer, yet I felt like one. After forty-five minutes I had to dismount and catch my breath. That’s when my partner spotted the problem. Both rear brakes were rubbing my back tire!\nRubber grips contested every pedal stroke.\nDon’t we do the same? Guilt presses on one side. Dread drags the other.\nNo wonder we get so tired. We sabotage our day, wiring it for disaster, lugging along yesterday’s troubles, downloading tomorrow’s struggles. Regret over the past, stress over the future. We aren’t giving the day a chance.\nWhat can we do? Here’s my proposal: consult Jesus. Entrust your day to his oversight. “Give us day by day our daily bread” (Luke 11:3). Leave yesterday behind. Let tomorrow wait. Give today a chance. ',
