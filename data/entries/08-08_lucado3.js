Two weeks later, we’re already planning our next purchase. We vacation in Hawaii and fill up on sun, fun, and good food. But we’re not even on the way home before we dread the end of the trip and begin planning another.\nWe are not satisfied. As a kid we say, “If only I were a teenager.” As a teen we say, “If only I were an adult.” As an adult, “If only I were married.”\nAs a spouse, “If only I had kids.”\nWe are not satisfied. Why is contentment so difficult? Because there is nothing on earth that can satisfy our deepest longing. We long to see God.\nAnd we won’t be satisfied until we do.\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
