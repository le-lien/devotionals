    "body": 'There are many reasons God saves you. It brings glory to Him. It allows you to come to Him without any sin. It shows that He is Lord of all.\nBut one of the sweetest reasons God saves you is because He is fond  of you.\nHe likes having you around. He thinks you are the best thing to come along since peanut butter.\nIf God had a refrigerator, your picture would be on it. If He had a wallet, your photo would be in it. He sends you flowers every spring and a sunrise every morning. Whenever you want to talk, He listens. God can live anywhere in the universe—the highest mountain or the most beautiful beach. But He chooses to live in your heart. ',
