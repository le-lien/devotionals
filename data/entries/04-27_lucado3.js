    "body": 'During our summer vacation I signed up for a sailing lesson. Ever puzzled by the difference in leeward, starboard, and stern, I asked the crew a few questions. After a while the captain offered, “Would you like to sail us home?” He assured me I would have no trouble. “Target that cliff,” he instructed. “Set your eyes and the boat on it.”\nI found the instruction hard to follow. Other sights invited my attention: the rich mahogany of the deck, the rich foam cresting on the waves. I wanted to look at it all. But if I looked too long, I risked losing the course. The boat stayed on target as long as I set my eyes ahead where they needed to be.\nWorship helps us do this in life. It lifts our eyes off the boat with its toys and passengers and sets them “on the realities of heaven, where Christ sits in the place of honor at God’s right hand” (Colossians 3:1 NLT). If you want to sail home, focus on the target of heaven. ',

      "text": 'Have you ever tried worshiping not just on Sundays, but every day? For the next week, see what happens if you set aside a short time each morning to praise God. Thank him for all that he is and all he does in your life. I predict you’ll do a much better job of keeping your life on course.'
