    "body": 'When [a friend] told Jesus of the illness [of Lazarus] he said, “Lord, the one you love is sick.” He doesn’t base his appeal on the imperfect love of the one in need, but on the perfect love of the Savior. He doesn’t say,\n“The one who loves you  is sick.” He says, “The one you love  is sick.” The power of the prayer, in other words, does not depend on the one who makes the prayer, but on the one who hears the prayer.\nWe can and must repeat the phrase in manifold ways. “The one you love is tired, sad, hungry, lonely, fearful, depressed.” The words of the prayer vary, but the response never changes. The Savior hears the prayer. He silences heaven, so he won’t miss a word. He hears the prayer. ',
