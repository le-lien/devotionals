Others may abandon you, divorce you, and ignore you, but God will love you. Always. No matter what.\nThis is his sentiment: “I’ll call nobodies and make them somebodies; I’ll call the unloved and make them beloved” (Rom. 9:25 MSG).\nThis is his promise. “I have loved you, my people, with an everlasting love. With unfailing love I have drawn you to myself” (Jer. 31:3 NLT).\nDo you know what else that means? You have a deep aquifer of love from which to draw. When you find it hard to love, then you need a drink!\nDrink deeply! Drink daily! ',
