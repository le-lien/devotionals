Tolstoy reached into his pocket to give the beggar some money, but his pocket was empty. Tolstoy turned to the man and said, “I’m sorry, my brother, but I have nothing to give.”\nThe beggar brightened and said, “You have given me more than I asked for—you have called me brother.”\nTo the loved, a word of affection is a morsel, but to the love-starved, a word of affection can be a feast.
