    "body": 'In Him [Christ] we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace.\n(Ephesians 1:7)\nLooking at this statement from the Word of God about the blood of Jesus, I will show you how to apply it with the hyssop of your personal testimony to your own life situation and need.\nThis verse tells us two things that we have through the blood of Jesus when we are in Christ. Remember, if we are outside of Christ, it does not avail. During the first Passover in Egypt, the blood did not protect those who were not inside their houses. It was only inside their houses that the Israelites were protected, and it is only inside Christ that we have redemption and forgiveness of sins.\nI know the above verse by heart. If I stood upside down in a corner of a dark room on a dark night, I could quote this Scripture without the least problem. I live by this Scripture. I keep my hyssop in my hand.\nBelieve me, not many days pass that I am not using the hyssop in my own life. I have discovered it does the job. ',
