Remember, if we are outside of Christ, it does not avail. During the first Passover in Egypt, the blood did not protect those who were not inside their houses. It was only inside their houses that the Israelites were protected, and it is only inside Christ that we have redemption and forgiveness of sins.\nI know the above verse by heart. If I stood upside down in a corner of a dark room on a dark night, I could quote this Scripture without the least problem. I live by this Scripture. I keep my hyssop in my hand.\nBelieve me, not many days pass that I am not using the hyssop in my own life. I have discovered it does the job.\nThank You, Lord, for the blood of Jesus. I apply it with the hyssop of my personal testimony, proclaiming that by His blood, I have redemption and forgiveness of sins. Through the blood of Jesus, all my sins are forgiven. Amen.\nPraying to Change History: God’s Atomic Weapon: The Blood of Jesus (audio) 32\nDECLARING GOD’S WORD\nDeclaring God’s Word text_vNZ.indd 32\n4/09/2013 11:38:01 a.m.\nWEEK 4:\nThe blood of Jesus\nChrist, God’s Son,\ncontinually cleanses\nme from all sin.
