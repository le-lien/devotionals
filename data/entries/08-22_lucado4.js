    "body": 'When I was growing up, all of us kids in the neighborhood would play street football. The minute we got home from school, we’d hit the pavement. One kid had a dad with a great arm and a love for football. As soon as he’d pull in the driveway from work, we’d start yelling for him to come and play ball. He couldn’t resist. Out of fairness he’d always ask,\n“Which team is losing?” Then he would join that team, which often seemed to be mine.\nWhen he joined the huddle, the whole game changed. He was confident, strong, and, most of all, he had a plan. He’d look at us and say, “Okay, boys, here is what we are going to do.” The other side was groaning before we left the huddle. You see, we not only had a new plan, but we also had a new leader. He brought new life to our team.\nGod does the same thing. In this sinful world, we don’t need a new play; we need a new plan. We don’t need to trade positions; we need a new player. That player is Jesus. ',
