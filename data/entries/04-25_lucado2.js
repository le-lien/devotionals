He is there for ours.\nAnd once the crook understands this, his request seems only natural. As he looks into the eyes of his last hope, he makes the same request any Christian has made: “Remember me when you come into your kingdom”\n(Luke 23:42 TLB).\nNo stained-glass homilies. No excuses. Just a desperate plea for help.\nAt this point Jesus performs the greatest miracle of the cross. Greater than the earthquake. Greater than the tearing of the temple curtain… .\nHe performs the miracle of forgiveness: “Today you will be with me in Paradise. This is a solemn promise” (Luke 23:43 TLB). ',
