    "body": 'Sometime ago our church staff attended a leadership conference.\nEspecially interested in one class, I arrived early and snagged a front-row seat. As the speaker began, however, I was distracted by a couple of voices in the back of the room. Two guys were mumbling to each other. I was giving serious thought to shooting a glare over my shoulder when the speaker offered an explanation. “Forgive me,” he said. “I forgot to explain why the two fellows at the back of the class are talking. One of them is an elder at a new church in Romania. He has traveled here to learn about church leadership. But he doesn’t speak English, so the message is being translated.”\nAll of a sudden everything changed. Patience replaced impatience. Why?\nBecause patience always hitches a ride with understanding. “A man of understanding holds his tongue” (Prov. 11:12 NIV). Don’t miss the connection between understanding and patience. Before you blow up, listen up. Before you strike out, tune in. ',
