    "body": 'More mornings than not I drag myself out of bed and onto the street. I run because I don’t like heart doctors.\nSince heart disease runs in our family, I run in our neighborhood. As the sun is rising, I am running. And as I am running, my body is groaning. It doesn’t want to cooperate. My knee hurts. My hip is stiff. My ankles complain.\nThings hurt. And as things hurt, I’ve learned that I have three options. Go home. (Denalyn would laugh at me.) Meditate on my hurts until I start imagining I’m having chest pains. (Pleasant thought.) Or I can keep running and watch the sun come up. If I watch God’s world go from dark to golden, guess what? The same happens to my attitude. The pain passes and the joints loosen. Everything improves as I fix my eyes on the sun.\nWasn’t that the same advice the author of Hebrews gave us—keep our eyes on the Son? ',
