We cry out for the inspiration of the God of power. We want to act in the Holy Spirit. We want to breathe out divine life. We want the glory, miracles, and wonders that work out the plan of the Most High God. We want to be absorbed by God, and we want to know nothing among men except Jesus and Him crucified (1 Cor. 2:2). Unto You, O God, be the glory and the honor and the power (Rev. 5:13)!\n\nYes, filled with God,\n\nYes, filled with God,\n\nEmptied of self and filled with God.\n\nFor He is so precious to me,\n\nFor He is so precious to me;\n\nIt‘s heaven below\n\nMy Redeemer to know,\n\nFor He is so precious to me. Can you wonder why I love Him so? May there be a cry until we witness Acts 11:15: “And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them.”\n\nOh, be on fire, oh, be on fire,\n\nOh, be on fire for God.\n\nOh, be on fire, be all on fire,\n\nBe all on fire for God.',
