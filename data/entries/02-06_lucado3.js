    "body": 'Ilike the story of the little boy who fell out of bed. When his mom asked him what happened, he answered, “I don’t know. I guess I stayed too close to where I got in.”\nEasy to do the same with our faith. It’s tempting just to stay where we got in and never move.\nPick a time in the not-too-distant past. A year or two ago. Now ask yourself a few questions. Do you talk to God more today than you did then?\nHas your joy increased? What about Bible reading and understanding? Can you tell you’ve grown? Is your faith growing deeper and your love for Jesus stronger?\nJust like friendships, a relationship with God works best when you make the effort to get closer. Don’t make the mistake of the little boy. Don’t stay where you got in. It’s risky resting on the edge. ',
