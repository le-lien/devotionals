But we are not even on the way home before we dread the end of the trip and begin planning another.\nWe are not satisfied.\nAs a child we say, “If only I were a teenager.” As a teen we say, “If only I were an adult,” As an adult, “If only I were married.” As a spouse, “If only I had kids.”…\nWe are not satisfied. Contentment is a difficult virtue. Why?\nBecause there is nothing on earth that can satisfy our deepest longing. We long to see God. The leaves of life are rustling with the rumor that we will\n—and we won’t be satisfied until we do. ',
