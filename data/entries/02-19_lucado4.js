I guess I stayed too close to where I got in.”\nIt’s easy to do the same thing with your faith. It’s easy to just stay where you are. But just as you are growing taller and learning more in school, this is also the time to grow and learn in Christ. Start some habits of faith such as these:\n• Pray every day—not just a quick word at mealtime, but really talk to God and tell Him about your day.\n• Read at least one verse of Scripture every day.\n• Memorize a verse each week.\n• Go to church and Bible study.\n• Decide to do one good thing for someone else each day.\nDon’t make the mistake of the little boy. Don’t stay too close to where you got in. Jump right in, and start growing your faith! ',
