As far as we know, they had never, as a group, done that before. Never. Check it out. Open your Bible. Search for a time when the disciples all joined together and praised Jesus. You won’t find it.\nYou won’t find them worshiping when He healed the leper. Reached out to the woman at the well. Preached to the masses. They were willing to follow. Willing to leave family. Willing to cast out demons. Willing to be in the Lord’s army.\nBut only after Jesus stilled the storm on the sea did they worship Him.\nWhy? ',
