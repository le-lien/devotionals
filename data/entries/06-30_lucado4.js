    "body": 'When do we have salvation?\nWhen we look to Jesus. When we believe that He is our Savior and we choose to obey Him. It’s really very simple, isn’t it? Read the great promise of John 3:16: “For God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son. God gave his Son so that whoever believes in him may not be lost, but have eternal life.” That is your  promise from God.\nWow! What a promise! Salvation. New life. All just for following Jesus.\nBut even though God’s plan is so simple, there are still those who don’t believe. They don’t trust His promise.\nThat’s where you come in. Show the world what a follower of Jesus looks like. Show those who don’t believe in Him the joy and hope that come from following Him. Show them that His power to help and to save people in this world is real. And show them that He wants to save them too.\nGrowing in Grace\nPeople who don’t know God may not feel comfortable coming to church. An invitation to Sunday school might even be scary. Try inviting them to hang out with some of your friends from church or to go to a devotional at someone’s home. It might be just the thing to make them more comfortable with Jesus.\nJuly ',
