    "body": 'It’s futile to try to establish your own sovereignty.\nPeople don’t want you as their king,\nand God won’t forsake his holy throne.\nI often give way to the fantasy that I have the wisdom, power,\nand character\nto control\npeople,\nplaces,\nand things in my life that seem to be out of control.\nI insert myself in the center\nand make it all about me.\nBut I don’t have the right,\npower,\nor need to control because you have every situation, every location, and every person under your wise control.\nYou rule over all things for my sake\nand for your glory.\nSo once again you call me to surrender control and rest in your sovereign care.',
