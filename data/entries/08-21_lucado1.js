    "body": 'When do we get our first clue that [Jesus] knows he is the Son of God? In the temple of Jerusalem. He is twelve years old. His parents are three days into the return trip to Nazareth before they notice he is missing.\nThey find him in the temple studying with the leaders… .\nAs a young boy, Jesus already senses the call of God. But what does he do next? Recruit apostles and preach sermons and perform miracles? No, he goes home to his folks and learns the family business.\nThat is exactly what you should do. Want to bring focus to your life? Do what Jesus did. Go home, love your family, and take care of business. But, Max, I want to be a missionary.  Your first mission field is under your roof.\nWhat makes you think they’ll believe you overseas if they don’t believe you across the hall? ',
