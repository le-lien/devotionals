    "body": 'I wish I could say that all my actions are godly, but they’re not. I wish I could say that I always live with God’s kingdom in view, but I don’t. I wish I could say that all my responses to the people in my life are motivated by love for God and for them, but they’re not. I wish awe of God was the principal motivation for all I do, but often it isn’t. I wish I could say that I love God’s glory more than my own, but there are still moments when I live as a glory thief. I wish I could say that selfishness and greed are in my rearview mirror, but there’s evidence that they’re not. I wish I could say that I have a heart of pure submission, but, sadly, there are times when I want my own way. I wish I could say that I always exhibit the fruit of the Spirit, but there are times when I don’t. I wish I could say that I always live inside the wisdom boundaries of God’s Word, but there are times when I foolishly think I’m smarter than God.\nI wish I could say that materialism doesn’t kidnap my heart anymore, but there are still times when it does. I wish I could say that I always rest in God’s control, but there are times when I want to be in charge. I wish I could say that there are never times when I am irritated or impatient, but I still struggle with both on occasion. I wish I could say that the worship of God rules my heart unchallenged, but the truth is that idolatry still nips at me. I wish I could say that I always rest in the righteousness of Christ, but there are still times when I give way to the pride of parading my so-called righteousness before others. I wish I could say that the great spiritual battle is over for me, but there is clear and regular evidence that it is not.\nAll this means that I value justifying grace. I celebrate that, in Christ, God found a way to be “just and the justifier” (Rom. 3:26) of the ungodly. I am daily thankful for the perfect life of Jesus. I am thankful that he subjected himself to the temptations of this fallen world. I am thankful that on the cross he took my stripes and carried my guilt and shame. I am thankful that he took the father’s rejection. I am thankful that he burst out of that tomb, conquering death. I am thankful that his righteousness is attributed to my account. I am thankful that he fulfilled the law and satisfied the Father’s anger. I still celebrate the fact that I\nhave been granted full, complete, and unending acceptance.\nI celebrate justifying grace because I am still unable to stand before God based on my own righteousness. I still fall short of his glory. So I am so very thankful that justifying grace ensures that I will forever be accepted as one of his righteous ones, even though I still don’t measure up. Yes, today I have reason again to be thankful for justifying grace.',
