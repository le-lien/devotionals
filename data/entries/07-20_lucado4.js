And I imagine it will be better than Christmas morning, better than a birthday, better than an ice-cream sundae—all rolled into one!\nWhen we see Jesus face-to-face, we will be looking into the eyes of One who loves us more than anyone else ever could. And His love will fill us with complete joy and peace.\nAll our sins and mistakes will be completely washed away forever. There will be no more guilt or shame, no more loneliness or being left out. We will never mess up again or stumble again or doubt again. Why? Because\n“when Christ comes again, we will be like him” (1 John 3:2).\nAnd I can’t wait! ',

A little hard to see your reflection, isn’t it? Now turn on the light. Much clearer! That’s what heaven will be like—we’ll be able to see Jesus clearly.'
