    "body": 'Deep within you, God’s Spirit confirms with your spirit that you belong to him. Beneath the vitals of the heart, God’s Spirit whispers, “You are mine. I bought you and sealed you, and no one can take you.” The Spirit offers an inward, comforting witness.\nHe is like a father who walks hand in hand with his little child. The child knows he belongs to his daddy, his small hand happily lost in the large one.\nHe feels no uncertainty about his papa’s love. But suddenly the father, moved by some impulse, swings his boy up into the air and into his arms and says, “I love you, Son.” …\nHas the relationship between the two changed? On one level, no. The father is no more the father than he was before the expression of love. But on a deeper level, yes. The dad drenched, showered, and saturated the boy in love. God’s Spirit does the same with us… . The Holy Spirit pours the love of God in our hearts. ',
