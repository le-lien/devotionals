    "body": 'To abound is to have a surplus, an abundance, an extravagant portion.\nShould the fish in the Pacific worry that it will run out of ocean? No. Why?\nThe ocean abounds with water. Need the lark be anxious about finding room in the sky to fly? No. The sky abounds with space.\nShould the Christian worry that the cup of mercy will run empty? He may. For he may not be aware of God’s abounding grace. Are you? Are you aware that the cup God gives you overflows with mercy? Or are you afraid your cup will run dry? Your warranty will expire? Are you afraid your mistakes are too great for God’s grace? …\nGod is not a miser with his grace. Your cup may be low on cash or clout, but it is overflowing with mercy.\nTraveling Light\nJuly\nGuide me in your truth\nand teach me, my God, my Savior. ',
