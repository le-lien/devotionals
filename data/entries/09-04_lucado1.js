When the last penny is gone before the last bill is paid? …\nI know what we are doing. Nibbling on nails like corn on the cob. Pacing floors. Taking pills… .\nBut what does God do? …\nHe fights for us. He steps into the ring and points us to our corner and takes over. “Remain calm; the LORD will fight for you” (Exod. 14:14).\nHis job is to fight. Our job is to trust.\nJust trust. Not direct. Or question… . Our job is to pray and wait. ',
