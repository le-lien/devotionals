    "body": 'eloved, I want God to give you a spiritual appetite so that you will have a great inward desire to eat the Word, where B you will savor it with joy, where you will consume it with grace. As the Word comes to you—the Word of God, the Bread of Heaven, the very thing you need, the very nature of the life of the Son of God—and as you eat, you will be made in a new order after Him who has created you for His plan and purpose.\n\nThe process of the Word of God must kindle in us a separation from the world. It must bring death to everything except the life of the Word of Christ in our hearts. I want to save you from judging, because to the degree that you have not come into the revelation of this eternal working in you, to that degree you will not come right through believing in the true principle of the Word of Life.\n\nThe Word of God is to give you light. The Spirit of the Lord and the Word of the Lord—one is light, the other is life. We must see that God wants us to have these two divine properties, life and light, so that we are in a perfect place to judge ourselves by the Word of God. The Word of God will stand true, whatever our opinions may be. Scripture says very truly, “For what if some did not believe? Will their unbelief make the faithfulness of God without effect?” (Rom. 3:3). Will it change the Word?\n\nGod will sift the believer. Get away from the chaff. Chaff is judgment; chaff is unbelief; chaff is fear; chaff is failing. It is the covering of the weak, and as long as it covers the weak, it hinders them from coming for bread. So God has to deal with the chaff; He has to remove it so that you might be the pure bread, the pure life, the pure word, and so that there will be no strange thing in you, no misunderstanding.\n\nGod has to deal with His people, and if God deals with the house of God, then the world will soon be dealt with (1 Pet. 4:17). The principle is this: all the world needs and longs to be right, and 168\n\nso we have to be salt and light to guide them, to lead them, to operate before them so that they see our good works and glorify our Lord.\n\nYou need the Bread to feed the life to you. The Word of God is the Bread. There is no famine going on now; God is giving us the Bread of Life.\n\n“He who comes to Me shall never hunger, and he who believes in Me shall never thirst”  (John 6:35). It is a constant satisfaction, an inward joyful expression, a place of peace.',
