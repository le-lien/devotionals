The doctor told him there was no need to make a will, that rabies could be cured. “Oh, I’m not making a will,” he replied. “I’m making a list of all the people I want to bite.”\nCouldn’t we all make such a list? You’ve already learned, haven’t you, that friends aren’t always friendly? Neighbors aren’t always neighborly?\nSome workers never work, and some bosses are always bossy?\nYou’ve already learned, haven’t you, that a promise made is not always a promise kept? Even though they said “yes” on the altar, they may say “no”\nin the marriage.\nYou’ve already learned, haven’t you, that we tend to fight back? To keep lists and snarl lips and growl at people we don’t like?\nGod wants your list. He wants you to leave the list at the cross. ',
