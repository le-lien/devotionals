Could it be that unity  is the key to reaching the world for Christ?\nIf unity is the key to evangelism, shouldn’t it have precedence in our prayers? Should we, as Paul said, “make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace” (Eph. 4:3 NIV)? If unity matters to God, then shouldn’t unity matter to us? If unity is a priority in heaven, then shouldn’t it be a priority on earth?\nNowhere, by the way, are we told to build  unity. We are told simply to keep  unity. From God’s perspective there is but “one flock and one shepherd” (John 10:16). Unity does not need to be created; it simply needs to be protected.\nHow do we do that? … Does that mean we compromise our convictions?\nNo. Does that mean we abandon the truths we cherish? No. But it does mean we look long and hard at the attitudes we carry. ',
