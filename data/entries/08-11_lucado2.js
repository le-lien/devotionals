Suppose I did the same? Suppose you came across me standing on the side of the road. I can go north or south. You ask me which way I’m going. My reply? “I’m going sorth.”\nThinking you didn’t hear correctly, you ask me to repeat the answer.\n“I’m going sorth. I can’t choose between north and south, so I’m going both. I’m going sorth.”\n“You can’t do that,” you reply. “You have to choose.”\n“OK,” I concede, “I’ll head nouth.”\n“Nouth is not an option!” you insist. “It’s either north or south. You gotta pick.”\nWhen it comes to Christ, you’ve got to do the same. ',
