Make sure this is God’s intended place for you. And, if you suspect it isn’t, get out. Don’t force what is wrong to be right. Be careful.\nAnd, until love is stirred, let God’s love be enough for you. There are seasons when God allows us to feel the frailty of human love so we’ll appreciate the strength of his love. Didn’t he do this with David? Saul turned on him. Michal, his wife, betrayed him. Jonathan and Samuel were David’s friends, but they couldn’t follow him into the wilderness. Betrayal and circumstances left David alone. Alone with God. And, as David discovered, God was enough. That’s why David wrote these words in a desert: “Your unfailing love is better than life itself. . . . You satisfy me more than the richest feast” (Psalm 63:3, 5 NLT). ',
