How can you and I learn to hear and know the voice of God? Here are a few ideas:\nGive God your waking-up thoughts. Before you face the day, face the Father. Before you step out of bed, pray that God will guide your steps this day.\nGive God your waiting thoughts. Spend time with Him being still and quiet. Wait to hear His voice.\nGive God your whispering thoughts. Just imagine: every moment is a chance to talk to God.\nGive God your end-of-day thoughts. As you settle into bed, let your mind settle on Him. End the day as you started it—talking to God. ',
