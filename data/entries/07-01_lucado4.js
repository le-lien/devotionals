Every chance you get, you’re going over those same hurt feelings again and again.\nI have one question for you: Who made you God? I don’t mean to sound like a smart aleck, but why are you doing His work for Him?\n“I will punish those who do wrong,” God declared. “I will repay them”\n(Hebrews 10:30).\nJudging people is God’s job—not yours. To think something else is to think that God can’t do it.\nRevenge is unholy. To forgive someone is to show them God’s holiness.\nForgiveness is not saying that the one who hurt you was right. Forgiveness is saying that you know God is faithful and He  will do what is right. ',

How the water covers over it? Let your hurt feelings sink with it as you forgive the one who spoke unkindly or treated you badly.'
