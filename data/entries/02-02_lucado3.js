    "body": 'With life comes change. With change comes fear, insecurity, sorrow, stress.\nSo what do you do? Hibernate? Take no risks for fear of failing? Give no love for fear of losing?\nA better idea is to look up. Set your bearings on the one and only North Star in the universe—God. Although life changes, he never does. Consider his strength. Unending. According to Paul, God’s power lasts forever (Romans 1:20). The words “I’m feeling strong today” he has never said. He feels equally strong every day.\nThink about it. God never pauses to eat or asks the angels to cover for him while he naps. He never signals a time-out or puts the prayer requests from Russia on hold while he handles South Africa. He “never slumbers or sleeps” (Psalm 121:4 NLT). Need a strong hand to hold? You’ll always find one in his. His strength never changes. ',

      "text": 'You probably know some strong guys at school. They’re the ones who major in weightlifting and make it look easy. Compare their strength to God’s, though, and they are as puny as a paper clip. No matter how strong your opponent in life, God’s strength is so much greater.'
