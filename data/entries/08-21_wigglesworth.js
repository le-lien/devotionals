    "body": 'ou must know where you are going. The great, mighty mastery piece of all is the great plan of the Rapture. It is the hope of glory, divine life, the peace of God, and the enrichment of the soul. It is “poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit”  (Rom. 5:5).\n\nThe Holy Spirit is the manifestation of God‘s Son. He is so uniquely divine that He has the power to overcome. His power is pure. His power must not cease to develop. The Holy Spirit is there to create development and to help us progress in our faith as the Lord would have us to.\n\nWe are saved by His life. Now that we have received salvation, He wants to open our eyes to understand what Christ really did for us. “In due time”  (v. 6), when there was no other to save us, when there was no hope, when the law had failed, Christ took our place, delivered us from all the powers of human weaknesses and failure, and so came to us in our sins. He reached out to us in love “while we were still sinners”  (v. 8). At just the right moment, He died for us and delivered us from the power of the Devil, delivered us from death, delivered us from sin, delivered us from the grave, and gave us a hope of immortality through His life. We are saved by His life.\n\nJesus is eternal. He has the power to impart eternal gifts. He has delivered us from the curse of the law and set us free. Who loves the Gospel as much as those who have been saved? What is the Gospel? It is “the power of God to salvation”  (Rom. 1:16). It has the power to bring immortality and life. Through His life in us, we are delivered from all things and are being prepared for the glorious hope of the coming of the Lord. That is why we sing, "He arose! He arose! Hallelujah, Christ arose!',
