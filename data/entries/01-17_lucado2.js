And do they have to call an airport a terminal? …\nSome of us have postgraduate degrees from the University of Anxiety.\nWe go to sleep worried that we won’t wake up; we wake up worried that we didn’t sleep. We worry that someone will discover that lettuce was fattening all along. The mother of one teenager bemoaned, “My daughter doesn’t tell me anything. I’m a nervous wreck.”\nAnother mother replied, “My daughter tells me everything. I’m a nervous wreck.” Wouldn’t you love to stop worrying? Could you use a strong shelter from life’s harsh elements?\nGod offers you just that: the possibility of a worry-free life. Not just less worry, but no worry. ',
