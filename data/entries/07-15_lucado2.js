    "body": 'Greed comes in many forms. Greed for approval. Greed for applause.\nGreed for status. Greed for the best office, the fastest car, the prettiest date.\nGreed has many faces, but speaks one language: the language of more.\nEpicurus noted, “Nothing is enough for the man to whom enough is too little.” And what was that observation of John D. Rockefeller’s? He was asked, “How much money does it take to satisfy a man?” He answered,\n“Just a little more.” Wise was the one who wrote, “Whoever loves money never has money enough; whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with his income” (Eccles. 5:10 NIV).\nGreed has a growling stomach. Feed it, and you risk more than budget-busting debt. You risk losing purpose. ',
