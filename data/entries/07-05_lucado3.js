    "body": 'Captain Sam Brown was serving in Afghanistan when an improvised explosive device turned his Humvee into a Molotov cocktail. Before Sam passed out, he caught a glimpse of his singed face in the mirror. He didn’t recognize himself.\nBy the time I met Sam in 2011, he’d undergone dozens of surgeries. The pain chart didn’t have a number high enough to register the agony he felt. Yet, in the midst of the horror, beauty walked in. He gathered the courage to ask out his dietician, Amy Larsen. The two continued to see each other. Sam talked to Amy about God’s mercy and led her to Christ. Soon thereafter they were married. And as I write these words, they are the parents of a seven-month-old baby boy. Sam directs a program to aid wounded soldiers.\nThe physical and emotional stress has taken its toll on their marriage at times. Yet Sam and Amy have come to believe that God’s math works differently than ours: War + near-death + agonizing rehab = wonderful family and hope for a bright future. In God’s hand, intended evil is eventual good. ',
