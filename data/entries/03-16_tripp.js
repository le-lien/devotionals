    "body": 'Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness!\nYou have given me relief when I was in distress.\nBe gracious to me and hear my prayer!\nO men, how long shall my honor be turned into shame?\nHow long will you love vain words and seek after lies? Selah But know that the LORD has set apart the godly for himself; the LORD hears when I call to him.\nBe angry, and do not sin;\nponder in your own hearts on your beds, and be silent. Selah Offer right sacrifices, and put your trust in the LORD.\nThere are many who say, “Who will show us some good?\nLift up the light of your face upon us, O LORD!”\nYou have put more joy in my heart\nthan they have when their grain and wine abound.\nIn peace I will both lie down and sleep;\nfor you alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety. (Psalm 4) These words were penned by David in one of the most heartbreaking moments of his life. He’s hiding out in a cave with a band of faithful men because his son is out to take his throne. In a monarchy, the only way to securely take a throne is by ending the life of the person who is on the throne. Imagine where your thoughts would go, where your emotions would be, and where your heart would run to in a situation like this. Is David content? Of course not. It appears that little good can come out of this moment in his life. Yet in his grief and discontent, he knows remarkable peace. He even talks about his heart being filled with joy! Why? Because at the deepest of levels, neither his peace nor his joy is based on the circumstances, but on the God who rules the circumstances.\nIf David’s security is in God and God alone, then he has as much security in that cave as he does in the palace, because it is the Lord alone who makes him dwell in safety. There is no doubt in David’s words.\nWhat will it be for you today—the discontent of doubt and fear or the contentment of peace and rest? It is only grace that can deliver us from fear and\ngive our hearts rest even when we’re in the cave once again.',
