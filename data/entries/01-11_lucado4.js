But He is there—just in a different way.\nGod is there in the kindness of a stranger. In the beauty of the sunset. In the gentle word and the hug just when you need it. Do you see Him now? ',

He never forces you to believe in Him, but He also never leaves you. He goes with you wherever you go. And He will use all His power to help you see that He really is God, that He loves you, and that you can trust Him to lead you home to heaven.',
