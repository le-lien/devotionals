Scan history for your replica; you won’t find it. God tailor-made you. He “personally formed and made each one”\n(Isa. 43:7 MSG). No box of “backup yous” sits in God’s workshop. You aren’t one of many bricks in the mason’s pile or one of a dozen bolts in the mechanic’s drawer. You are it! And if you aren’t you, we don’t get you. The world misses out.\nYou are heaven’s Halley’s comet; we have one shot at seeing you shine. ',
