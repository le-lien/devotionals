You want a boyfriend or girlfriend—now!\nYou’ve heard the saying “A watched pot never boils.” Patience is a slow boil. It doesn’t turn up the flame. It waits for the burner to heat the pan, which heats the water to 212 degrees. You must sit back and allow it to happen.\nLife is often this way. It’s our nature to decide on what we want then dive in and make it happen. But if we jump ahead of God and the perfect timing of his plan for us, we only set ourselves up for a hard landing. When we patiently wait on him, he meets our needs at just the right moment.\nIf you have the Holy Spirit, then you have the potential of making patience a part of your life. Thankfully, God is patient while you find that patience. ',
