Or you want your grandmother’s sickness to go away.\nSo you pray and wait.\nNo answer.\nYou pray and wait some more.\nStill no answer.\nWhat if God says no? What if God says, “not right now,” or even just plain no? If God says no, what will you do? If God says, “I’ve given you My grace, and that is enough,” will you be content?\nContent. That’s the word. Content means being at peace even if God gives you nothing more than what He already has given—His love, His mercy, and His grace. ',
