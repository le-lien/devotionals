You can’t lose if you don’t try, right? You can’t fall if you don’t take a stand, right? You can’t lose your balance if you never climb, right? So don’t try it. Just stay home, snuggle under a blanket, and stay warm and dry.\nAnd there is the voice of adventure—God’s adventure. It whispers , Follow Me. I’ve got the most amazing adventure planned for you in My kingdom. There are hearts to touch, souls to save, songs to sing, prayers to pray—and you can be part of it all.\nDon’t just hide under the blankets and stay home. Choose adventure. ',

But playing it safe doesn’t mean you never take risks. You can take godly risks like being a friend to the friendless, serving the helpless, and inviting others to church.'
