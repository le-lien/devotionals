What we threw around before, we began putting away. What we neglected we cleaned up. What had been clutter became order. Oh, there were and still are moments when we blow it, but by and large he got our house in order.\nSuddenly we find ourselves wanting to do good. Helping family.\nEncouraging friends. Go back to the old mess? Are you kidding? “In the past you were slaves to sin—sin controlled you. But thank God, you fully obeyed the things that you were taught. You were made free from sin, and now you are slaves to goodness” (Romans 6:17–18 NCV).\nWho wants to be a self-centered slob? Following God and doing good feels so much better. ',
