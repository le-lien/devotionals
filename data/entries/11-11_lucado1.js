They were dressed in white and had golden crowns on their heads” (Rev. 4:4)… .\nAll are dressed in white. The saints. The elders. . . . How would you suppose Jesus is dressed? In white? … “He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is the Word of God” (Rev. 19:13).\nWhy is Christ’s robe not white? Why is his cloak not spotless? Why is his garment dipped in blood? . . . Paul says simply, “He changed places with us” (Gal. 3:13)… .\nHe wore our coat of sin to the cross. ',
