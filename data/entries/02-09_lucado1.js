    "body": 'Go with me back in history a couple of thousand years. Let’s go to Rome … to a rather drab little room, surrounded by high walls… . Inside we see a man seated on the floor. He’s an older fellow, shoulders stooped and balding. Chains are on his hands and feet… .\nIt is the apostle Paul… . The apostle who was bound only by the will of God is now in chains—stuck in a dingy house—attached to a Roman officer… .\nHe is writing a letter. No doubt it is a complaint letter to God. No doubt it is a list of grievances… . He has every reason to be bitter and complain.\nBut he doesn’t. Instead, he writes a letter that two thousand years later is still known as the treatise on joy— Philippians… .\nWhy don’t you spend some time with it? ',
