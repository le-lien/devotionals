Maybe you look at the people around you and think that they’re all perfect. That their faith is perfect. That they never mess up. So you’re afraid to tell God that you’ve messed up.\nIf that sounds like you, look carefully at one person Jesus praised for her faith. It wasn’t the perfect person. It wasn’t the never-messes-up person. It was a poor, sick outcast—a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years. But she had faith. She had a hunch that Jesus could  help her and a hope that He would  help her.\nWhich, by the way, is a pretty good definition of faith. A belief that He can help and a hope that He will. ',
