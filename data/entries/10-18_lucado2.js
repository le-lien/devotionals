Don’t most of us tend to scrutinize life behind furrowed brows and walk with cautious steps? It’s hard for us to imagine that God can surprise us. To make a little room for miracles today, well, it’s not sound thinking.\nWe make the same mistake that Thomas made: we forget that\n“impossible” is one of God’s favorite words.\nHow about you? How is your imagination these days? When was the last time you let some of your dreams elbow out your logic? When was the last time you imagined the unimaginable? . . . Has it been awhile since you claimed God’s promise to do “more than we can ask or imagine?” (Eph.\n3:20) ',
