It’s not easy to get someone’s attention.\nThat person must be willing to turn down the radio, turn away from the computer, turn the corner of the page and put down the book. When someone in our world is willing to turn off everything else to listen to us, it is a gift. A very rare gift.\nBut in heaven God is always listening. Your prayers are like precious jewels to Him. Your words rise up to God like a soft breeze—and they don’t stop until they reach His throne.\nYour prayers on earth stir up God’s power in heaven, and “what [God wants] will be done, here on earth as it is in heaven” (Matthew 6:10).
