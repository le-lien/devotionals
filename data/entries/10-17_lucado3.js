    "body": 'Agreat storm arose on the lake so that waves covered the boat, but Jesus was sleeping” (Matthew 8:24 NCV).\nNow there’s a scene. The disciples scream; Jesus dreams. Thunder roars; Jesus snores. His snooze troubles the disciples. “Teacher, don’t you care that we’re going to drown?” (Mark 4:38 NLT). They do not ask about Jesus’\nstrength, his knowledge, or his know-how. They raise doubts about Jesus’\ncharacter: “Do you not care …”\nFear does this. Fear wears down our confidence in God’s goodness. It also muffles our memory. The disciples had reason to trust Jesus. By now they’d seen him “healing all kinds of sickness and all kinds of disease among the people” (Matthew 4:23). They had witnessed him heal a leper with a touch and a servant with a command (8:3, 13).\nDid they remember the accomplishments of Christ? Maybe they didn’t.\nFear creates a form of spiritual amnesia. It makes us forget what Jesus has done and how good God is.\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
