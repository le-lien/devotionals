    "body": 'Alife lived for God is a life that can be filled with peace. Not a random, wimpy, earthly peace, but his peace. Imported from heaven. God offers you the same tranquility that fills his throne room.\nDo you think he battles anxiety? You suppose he ever wrings his hands or asks the angels for antacids? Of course not. A problem is no more a challenge to God than a twig is to an elephant. God enjoys perfect peace because God enjoys perfect power.\nAnd he offers his peace to you. A peace that will “guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus” (Philippians 4:7 NLT). Paul uses a military metaphor here. The Philippians, living in a garrison town, were accustomed to the Roman sentries maintaining their watch. Before any enemy could get inside, he had to pass through the guards. God gives you the same offer. His supernatural peace overshadows you, guarding your heart.\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
