    "body": 'Stand and consider:\n• The Hubble Space Telescope sends back infrared images of faint galaxies that are perhaps twelve billion light-years away (twelve billion times six trillion miles).\n• Astronomers venture a feeble estimate that the number of stars in the universe equals the number of grains of sand on all the beaches of the world.\n• The star Betelgeuse has a diameter of 100 million miles, which is larger than the earth’s orbit around the sun.\nWhy the immensity? Why such vast, unmeasured, unexplored, “unused”\nspace? So that you and I, freshly stunned, could be stirred by this resolve: “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.”\nThe Christ of the galaxies is the Christ of your Mondays. ',
