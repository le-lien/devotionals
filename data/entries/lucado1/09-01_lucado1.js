They don’t quench—they kill.\n“Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness… .”\nRighteousness.  That’s it. That’s what we are thirsty for. We’re thirsty for a clean conscience. We crave a clean slate. We yearn for a fresh start. We pray for a hand that will enter the dark cavern of our world and do for us the one thing we can’t do for ourselves—make us right again. ',
