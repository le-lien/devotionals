    "body": 'Read how J. B. Phillips translates Hebrews 4:15: For we have no superhuman High Priest to whom our weaknesses are unintelligible—he himself has shared fully in all our experience of temptation, except that he never sinned.\nIt’s as if he knows that we will say to God … : “God, it’s easy for you up there. You don’t know how hard it is from down here.” So he boldly proclaims Jesus’ ability to understand. Look at the wording again.\nHe himself.  Not an angel. Not an ambassador. Not an emissary, but Jesus himself.\nShared fully.  Not partially. Not nearly. Not to a large degree. Entirely!\nJesus shared fully.\nIn all our experience.  Every hurt. Each ache. All the stresses and all the strains. No exceptions. No substitutes. Why? So he could sympathize with our weaknesses. ',
