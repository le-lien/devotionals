If a sentence or two could capture God’s desire for each of us, it might read like this:\nGod loves you just the way you are, but he refuses to leave you that way. He wants you to be just like Jesus.\nGod loves you just the way you are. If you think his love for you would be stronger if your faith were, you are wrong. If you think his love would be deeper if your thoughts were, wrong again. Don’t confuse God’s love with the love of people. The love of people often increases with performance and decreases with mistakes. Not so with God’s love. He loves you right where you are. ',
