He longs to be worshiped when we sit at the dinner table and not just when we come to his communion table. You may go days without thinking of him, but there’s never a moment when he’s not thinking of you.\nKnowing this, we understand Paul’s rigorous goal: “We capture every thought and make it give up and obey Christ” (2 Cor. 10:5). We can fathom why he urges us to “pray without ceasing” (1 Thess. 5:17), “be constant in prayer” (Rom. 12:12) . . . and “let heaven fill your thoughts” (Col. 4:2\nTLB). ',
