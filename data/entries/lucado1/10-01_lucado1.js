As he gathers his books and heads for the door, he pauses by his father’s chair. He searches his father’s face. Benção, Pai?  Marcos asks. (Blessing, Father?) The father raises his hand. Deus te abençoe, meu filho,  he assures. (God bless you, my son.) …\nFather and child part for the day, a blessing requested, a blessing willingly given… .\nWe should do the same. Like the child longing for the father’s favor, each of us needs a daily reminder of our heavenly Father’s love. ',
