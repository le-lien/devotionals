    "body": 'Great acts of faith are seldom born out of calm calculation.\nIt wasn’t logic that caused Moses to raise his staff on the bank of the Red Sea.\nIt wasn’t medical research that convinced Naaman to dip seven times in the river.\nIt wasn’t common sense that caused Paul to abandon the Law and embrace grace.\nAnd it wasn’t a confident committee that prayed in a small room in Jerusalem for Peter’s release from prison. It was a fearful, desperate, band of backed-into-a-corner believers. It was a church with no options. A congregation of have-nots pleading for help.\nAnd never were they stronger.\nAt the beginning of every act of faith, there is often a seed of fear. ',
