    "body": 'With one decision, history began. Existence became measurable.\nOut of nothing came light.\nOut of light came day.\nThen came sky … and earth.\nAnd on this earth? A mighty hand went to work.\nCanyons were carved. Oceans were dug. Mountains erupted out of flatlands. Stars were flung. A universe sparkled.\nLook to the canyons to see the Creator’s splendor. Touch the flowers and see his delicacy. Listen to the thunder and hear his power… .\nToday you will encounter God’s creation. When you see the beauty around you, let each detail remind you to lift your head in praise. Express your appreciation for God’s creation. Encourage others to see the beauty of his creation. ',
