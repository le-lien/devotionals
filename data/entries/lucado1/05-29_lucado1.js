    "body": 'Does hell serve a purpose? … Remove it from the Bible and, at the same time, remove any notion of a just God and a trustworthy Scripture… .\nIf there is no hell, God is not just. If there is no punishment of sin, heaven is apathetic toward the rapists and pillagers and mass murderers of society.\nIf there is no hell, God is blind toward the victims and has turned his back on those who pray for relief. If there is no wrath toward evil, then God is not love, for love hates that which is evil.\nTo say there is no hell is also to say God is a liar and his Scripture untrue.\nThe Bible repeatedly and stoutly affirms the dualistic outcome of history.\nSome will be saved. Some will be lost. ',
