He helps… .\nWhy don’t I let my Father do for me what I am more than willing to do for my own children?\nI’m learning… . Being a father is teaching me that when I am criticized, injured, or afraid, there is a Father who is ready to comfort me. There is a Father who will hold me until I’m better, help me until I can live with the hurt, and who won’t go to sleep when I’m afraid of waking up and seeing the dark.\nEver. ',
