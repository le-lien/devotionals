    "body": 'What do we know about our resurrected bodies? They will be unlike any we have ever imagined.\nWill we look so different that we aren’t instantly recognized? Perhaps.\n(We may need nametags.) Will we be walking through walls? Chances are we’ll be doing much more.\nWill we still bear the scars from the pain of life? The marks of war. The disfigurements of disease. The wounds of violence. Will these remain on our bodies? That is a very good question. Jesus, at least for forty days, kept his. Will we keep ours? On this issue, we have only opinions, but my opinion is that we won’t. Peter tells us that “by his wounds you have been healed” (1 Peter 2:24 NIV). In heaven’s accounting, only one wound is worthy to be remembered. And that is the wound of Jesus. Our wounds will be no more. ',
