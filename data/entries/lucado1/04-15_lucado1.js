    "body": 'Mary and Mary [Magdalene] knew a task had to be done—Jesus’\nbody had to be prepared for burial. Peter didn’t offer to do it. Andrew didn’t volunteer… . So the two Marys decide to do it… .\nI wonder if halfway to the tomb they had sat down and reconsidered.\nWhat if they’d looked at each other and shrugged, “What’s the use?” What if they had given up? What if one had thrown up her arms in frustration and bemoaned, “I’m tired of being the only one who cares. Let Andrew do something for a change. Let Nathaniel show some leadership.”\nWhether or not they were tempted to, I’m glad they didn’t quit. That would have been tragic. You see, we know something they didn’t. We know the Father was watching. Mary and Mary thought they were alone. They weren’t. They thought their journey was unnoticed. They were wrong. God knew. ',
