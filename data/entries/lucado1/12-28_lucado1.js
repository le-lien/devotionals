    "body": 'To believe we are totally and eternally debt free is seldom easy.\nEven if we’ve stood before the throne and heard it from the king himself, we still doubt. As a result, many are forgiven only a little, not because the grace of the king is limited, but because the faith of the sinner is small. God is willing to forgive all. He’s willing to wipe the slate completely clean. He guides us to a pool of mercy and invites us to bathe. Some plunge in, but others just touch the surface. They leave feeling unforgiven… .\nWhere the grace of God is missed, bitterness is born. But where the grace of God is embraced, forgiveness flourishes… .\nThe more we immerse ourselves in grace, the more likely we are to give grace. ',
