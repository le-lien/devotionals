God is the King who prepares the palace, sets the table, and invites his subjects to come in.\nIn fact, it seems his favorite word is come.\n“Come, let us talk about these things. Though your sins are like scarlet, they can be as white as snow.”\n“All you who are thirsty, come  and drink.”\n“Come  to me all, all of you who are tired and have heavy loads, and I will give you rest.” …\nGod is a God who invites. God is a God who calls. ',
