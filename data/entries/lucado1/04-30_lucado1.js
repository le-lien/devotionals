Jesus teaches us to pray, “Forgive our debts … and lead us not into temptation.”\nWe’ve all made mistakes and we’ll all make some more. The line that separates the best of us from the worst of us is a narrow one, hence we’d be wise to take seriously Paul’s admonition: Why do you judge your brothers or sisters in Christ? And why do you think you are better than they? We will all stand before the Lord to be judged… . (Rom 14:10).\nYour sister would like me to remind you that she needs grace. Just like you need forgiveness, so does she. There comes a time in every relationship when it’s damaging to seek justice, when settling the score only stirs the fire. There comes a time when the best thing you can do is accept your brother and offer him the same grace you’ve been given.\nThe Great House of God\nMay\nYour word is like a lamp for my feet and a light for my path.
