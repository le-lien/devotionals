Inadequate holiness. God requires a certain balance of virtue in our account, and it’s more than any of us has alone. Our holiness account shows insufficient funds, and only the holy will see the Lord; what can we do?\nWe could try making a few deposits. Maybe if I wave at my neighbor or compliment my husband or go to church next Sunday, I’ll get caught up.\nBut how do you know when you’ve made enough? …\nIf you are trying to justify your own statement, forget ever having peace.\n… You are trying to justify an account you can’t justify… . “It is God who justifies” (Rom. 8:33).
