And all you have to offer him is your hurt.\nMaybe that has kept you from coming to God. Oh, you’ve taken a step or two in his direction. But then you saw the other people around him. They seemed so clean, so neat, so trim and fit in their faith. And when you saw them, they blocked your view of him. So you stepped back.\nIf that describes you, note carefully, . . . one person [whom Christ]\ncommended … for having faith. It wasn’t a wealthy giver. It wasn’t a loyal follower. It wasn’t an acclaimed teacher. It was a shame-struck, penniless outcast—[a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years]—who clutched onto her hunch that he could and her hope that he would.\nWhich, by the way, isn’t a bad definition of faith. A conviction that he can and a hope that he will. ',
