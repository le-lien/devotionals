The question. “But who do you say that I am?”\nHe doesn’t ask, “What do you think about what I’ve done?” He asks,\n“Who do you say that I am?” …\nHe doesn’t ask, “Who do your friends think? … Who do your parents think? … Who do your peers think?” He poses instead a starkly personal query, “Who do you  think I am?” …\nYou have been asked some important questions in your life: Will you marry me?\nWould you be interested in a transfer?\nWhat would you think if I told you I was pregnant?\nYou’ve been asked some important questions. But the grandest of them is an anthill compared to the Everest found in the eighth chapter of Mark.\nWho do you say that I am? ',
