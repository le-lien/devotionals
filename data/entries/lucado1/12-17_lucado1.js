    "body": 'Can you imagine prospective parents saying, “We’d like to adopt Johnny, but first we want to know a few things. Does he have a house to live in? Does he have money for tuition? Does he have a ride to school every morning and clothes to wear every day? Can he prepare his own meals and mend his own clothes?”\nNo agency would stand for such talk. Its representative would lift her hand and say, “Wait a minute. You don’t understand. You don’t adopt Johnny because of what he has; you adopt him because of what he needs.\nHe needs a home.”\nThe same is true with God. He doesn’t adopt us because of what we have.\nHe doesn’t give us his name because of our wit or wallet or good attitude…\n. Adoption is something we receive, not something we earn. ',
