Ponder them. .\n. .\nOr better still, take him with you to your canyon of shame. Invite Christ to journey with you … to stand beside you as you retell the events of the darkest nights of your soul.\nAnd then listen. Listen carefully. He’s speaking… . “I don’t judge you guilty.”\nAnd watch. Watch carefully. He’s writing. He’s leaving a message. Not in the sand, but on a cross.\nNot with his hand, but with his blood.\nHis message has two words: Not guilty. ',
