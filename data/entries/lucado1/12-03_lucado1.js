But faith is the conviction that God knows more than we do about this life, and he will get us through it.\nRemember, disappointment is cured by revamped expectations.\nI like the story about the fellow who went to the pet store in search of a singing parakeet. Seems he was a bachelor and his house was too quiet. The store owner had just the bird for him, so the man bought it.\nThe next day the bachelor came home from work to a house full of music. He went to the cage to feed the bird and noticed for the first time that the parakeet had only one leg.\nHe felt cheated that he’d been sold a one-legged bird, so he called and complained.\n“What do you want,” the store owner responded, “a bird who can sing or a bird who can dance?”\nGood question for times of disappointment.
