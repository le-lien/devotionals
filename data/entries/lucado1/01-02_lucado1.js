    "body": 'Do you ever feel unnoticed? New clothes and styles may help for a while. But if you want permanent change, learn to see yourself as God sees you: “He has covered me with clothes of salvation and wrapped me with a coat of goodness, like a bridegroom dressed for his wedding, like a bride dressed in jewels” (Isa. 61:10).\nDoes your self-esteem ever sag? When it does, remember what you are worth. “You were bought, not with something that ruins like gold or silver, but with the precious blood of Christ, who was like a pure and perfect lamb” (1 Pet. 1:18–19).\nThe challenge is to remember that. To meditate on it. To focus on it. To allow his love to change the way you look at you. ',
