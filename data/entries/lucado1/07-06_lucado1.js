    "body": 'When we see Christ, what will we see?\nWe will see the perfect priest. “He was dressed in a long robe and had a gold band around his chest” (Rev. 1:13). The first readers of this message knew the significance of the robe and band. Jesus is wearing the clothing of a priest. A priest presents people to God and God to people.\nYou have known other priests. There have been others in your life, whether clergy or not, who sought to bring you to God. But they, too, needed a priest. Some needed a priest more than you did. They, like you, were sinful. Not so with Jesus. “Jesus is the kind of high priest we need. He is holy, sinless, pure, not influenced by sinners, and he is raised above the heavens” (Heb. 7:26).\nJesus is the perfect priest. ',
