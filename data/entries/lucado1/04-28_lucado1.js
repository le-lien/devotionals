What right does he have to pray… , “Jesus remember me when you come into your kingdom”?\nDo you really want to know? The same right you have to pray… .\nYou see, that is you and me on the cross. Naked, desolate, hopeless, and estranged. That is us. That is us asking… .\nWe don’t boast. We don’t produce our list. Any sacrifice appears silly when placed before God on a cross… .\nWe, like the thief, have one more prayer. And we, like the thief, pray.\nAnd we, like the thief, hear the voice of grace. ',
