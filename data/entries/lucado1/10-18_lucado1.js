    "body": 'If only, when God smiles and says we are saved, we’d salute him, thank him, and live like those who have just received a gift from the commander in chief.\nWe seldom do that, though. We prefer to get salvation the old-fashioned way: We earn it. To accept grace is to admit failure, a step we are hesitant to take. We opt to impress God with how good we are rather than confessing how great he is. We dizzy ourselves with doctrine. Burden ourselves with rules. Think that God will smile on our efforts.\nHe doesn’t.\nGod’s smile is not for the healthy hiker who boasts that he made the journey alone. It is, instead, for the crippled leper who begs God for a back on which to ride. ',
