Guard against the false physicians who promise that joy is only a diet away, a marriage away, a job away, or a transfer away… .\nTry this. Imagine a perfect world. Whatever that means to you, imagine it. Does that mean peace? Then envision absolute tranquility. Does a perfect world imply joy? Then create your highest happiness. Will a perfect world have love? If so, ponder a place where love has no bounds. Whatever heaven means to you, imagine it. Get it firmly fixed in your mind… .\nAnd then smile as the Father reminds you, No one has ever imagined what God has prepared for those who love him… .\nWhen it comes to describing heaven, we are all happy failures.
