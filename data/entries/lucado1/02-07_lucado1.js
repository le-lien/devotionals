    "body": 'When it comes to resting your soul, there is no place like the Great House of God. “I’m asking Yahweh for one thing,” [David] wrote, “only one thing: to live with him in his house my whole life long. I’ll contemplate his beauty, I’ll study at his feet. That’s the only quiet secure place in a noisy world” (Ps. 27:4–5 MSG).\nIf you could ask God for one thing, what would you request? David tells us what he would ask. He longs to live  in the house of God. I emphasize the word live, because it deserves to be emphasized. David doesn’t want to chat. He doesn’t desire a cup of coffee on the back porch. He doesn’t ask for a meal or to spend an evening in God’s house. He wants to move in with him … forever. He’s asking for his own room … permanently. He doesn’t want to be stationed in God’s house, he longs to retire there. He doesn’t seek a temporary assignment, but rather lifelong residence. ',
