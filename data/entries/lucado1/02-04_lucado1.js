Healing starts when we take a step.\nGod’s help is near and always available, but it is only given to those who seek it. Nothing results from apathy… .\nGod honors radical, risk-taking faith.\nWhen arks are built, lives are saved. When soldiers march, Jerichos tumble. When staffs are raised, seas still open. When a lunch is shared, thousands are fed. And when a garment is touched—whether by the hand of an anemic woman in Galilee or by the prayers of a beggar in Bangladesh—\nJesus stops. He stops and responds. ',
