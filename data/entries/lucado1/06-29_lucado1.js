To exchange your devotion for a quick thrill.\nThey whisper. They woo. They taunt. They tantalize. They flirt. They flatter. “Go ahead, it’s OK.” “Don’t worry, no one will know.”\nThe world rams at your door; Jesus taps at your door. The voices scream for your allegiance; Jesus softly and tenderly requests it. The world promises flashy pleasure; Jesus promises a quiet dinner … with God.\nWhich voice do you hear? ',
