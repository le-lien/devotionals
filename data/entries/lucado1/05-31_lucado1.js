    "body": 'Antonio Stradivari was a seventeenth-century violin maker whose name in its Latin form, Stradivarius,  has become synonymous with excellence. He once said that to make a violin less than his best would be to rob God, who could not make Antonio Stradivari’s violins without Antonio.\nHe was right. God could not make Stradivarius violins without Antonio Stradivari. Certain gifts were given to that craftsman that no other violin maker possessed.\nIn the same vein, there are certain things you can do that no one else can.\nPerhaps it is parenting, or constructing houses, or encouraging the discouraged. There are things that only  you can do, and you are alive to do them. In the great orchestra we call life, you have an instrument and a song, and you owe it to God to play them both sublimely.\nThe Applause of Heaven\nJune\nWhat we see will last only a short time, but what we cannot see will last forever.
