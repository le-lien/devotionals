    "body": 'When the disciples saw Jesus in the middle of their stormy night, they called him a ghost. A phantom… . To them, the glow was anything but God.\nWhen we see gentle lights on the horizon, we often have the same reaction. We dismiss occasional kindness as apparitions, accidents, or anomalies. Anything but God… .\nAnd because we look for the bonfire, we miss the candle. Because we listen for the shout, we miss the whisper.\nBut it is in burnished candles that God comes, and through whispered promises he speaks: “When you doubt, look around; I am closer than you think.” ',
