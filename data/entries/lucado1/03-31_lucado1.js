    "body": 'A day is coming when everyone will hear [Jesus’] voice. A day is coming when all the other voices will be silenced; his voice—and his voice only—will be heard.\nSome will hear his voice for the very first time. It’s not that he never spoke, it’s just that they never listened. For these, God’s voice will be the voice of a stranger. They will hear it once—and never hear it again. They will spend eternity fending off the voices they followed on earth.\nBut others will be called from their graves by a familiar voice. For they are sheep who know their shepherd. They are servants who opened the door when Jesus knocked.\nNow the door will open again. Only this time, it won’t be Jesus who walks into our house; it will be we, who walk into his.\nIn the Eye of the Storm\nApril\nBe strong in the Lord and in his great power. ',
