    "body": '“Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me alone to do all the work?” (Luke 11:40)… .\nMartha’s life was cluttered. She needed a break. “Martha, Martha, you are worried and upset about many things,” the Master explained to her.\n“Only one thing is important. Mary has chosen [it]” (Luke 11:41–42).\nWhat had Mary chosen? She had chosen to sit at the feet of Christ. God is more pleased with the quiet attention of a sincere servant than the noisy service of a sour one… .\nWhat matters more than the type of service is the heart behind the service. A bad attitude spoils the gift we leave on the altar for God. ',
