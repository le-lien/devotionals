    "body": 'Once there was a man who dared God to speak: Burn the bush like you did for Moses, God. And I will follow. Collapse the walls like you did for Joshua, God. And I will fight. Still the waves like you did on Galilee, God. And I will listen.\nAnd so the man sat by a bush, near a wall, close to the sea and waited for God to speak.\nAnd God heard the man, so God answered. He sent fire, not for a bush, but for a church. He brought down a wall, not of brick, but of sin. He stilled a storm, not of the sea, but of a soul.\nAnd God waited for the man to respond. And he waited … and waited.\nBut because the man was looking at bushes, not hearts; bricks and not lives, seas and not souls, he decided that God had done nothing.\nFinally he looked to God and asked, Have you lost your power?\nAnd God looked at him and said, Have you lost your hearing?
