The outer limits?\nHeed the fire within!\nDo you have a passion to sing? Then sing! Are you stirred to manage?\nThen manage! Do you ache for the ill? Then treat them! Do you hurt for the lost? Then teach them!\nAs a young man I felt the call to preach. Unsure if I was correct in my reading of God’s will for me, I sought the counsel of a minister I admired.\nHis counsel still rings true. “Don’t preach,” he said, “unless you have to.”\nAs I pondered his words I found my answer: “I have to. If I don’t, the fire will consume me.”\nWhat is the fire that consumes you? ',
