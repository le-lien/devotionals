Are your challenges too great? Seek the help of Jehovah-shalom,  the Lord is peace. Is your body sick? Are your emotions weak? Jehovah-rophe,  the Lord who heals you, will see you now.\nDo you feel like a soldier stranded behind enemy lines? Take refuge in Jehovah-nissi,  the Lord my banner.\nMeditating on the names of God reminds you of the character of God.\nTake these names and bury them in your heart.\nGod is\nthe shepherd who guides,\nthe Lord who provides,\nthe voice who brings peace in the storm,\nthe physician who heals the sick, and\nthe banner that guides the soldier.
