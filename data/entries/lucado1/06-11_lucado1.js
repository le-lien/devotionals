You worry that:\nYour co-workers won’t appreciate you.\nYour leaders will overwork you.\nYour superintendent won’t understand you.\nYour congregation won’t support you.\nWith time, your agenda becomes more important than God’s. You’re more concerned with presenting self than pleasing him. And you may even find yourself doubting God’s judgment… .\nGod has gifted you with talents. He has done the same to your neighbor.\nIf you concern yourself with your neighbor’s talents, you will neglect yours.\nBut if you concern yourself with yours, you could inspire both. ',
