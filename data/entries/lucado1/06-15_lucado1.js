Isn’t it incredible that God leaves the choice to us? Think about it. There are many things in life we can’t choose.\nWe can’t, for example, choose the weather. We can’t control the economy.\nWe can’t choose whether or not we are born with a big nose or blue eyes or a lot of hair. We can’t even choose how people respond to us.\nBut we can choose where we spend eternity. The big choice, God leaves to us. The critical decision is ours.\nThat is the only decision which really matters. ',
