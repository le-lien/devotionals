You will be just like Jesus… .\nOf all the blessings of heaven, one of the greatest will be you! You will be God’s magnum opus, his work of art. The angels will gasp. God’s work will be completed. At last, you will have a heart like his.\nYou will love with a perfect love.\nYou will worship with a radiant face.\nYou’ll hear each word God speaks.\nYour heart will be pure, your words will be like jewels, your thoughts will be like treasures.\nYou will be just like Jesus. You will, at long last, have a heart like his. ',
