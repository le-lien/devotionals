We’d inch our bloated bellies from one ice-cream store to the next… .\nCan you imagine the chaos if God indulged each of ours? …\n“For God has not destined  us [emphasis mine] to the terrors of judgement, but to the full attainment of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ” (1 Thess. 5:9 NEB).\nNote God’s destiny for your life. Salvation.\nGod’s overarching desire is that you reach that destiny. His itinerary includes stops that encourage your journey. He frowns on stops that deter you. When his sovereign plan and your earthly plan collide, a decision must be made. Who’s in charge of this journey?\nIf God must choose between your earthly satisfaction and your heavenly salvation, which do you hope he chooses?\nMe too. ',
