And something happened in their hearts. “It felt like a fire burning in us when Jesus talked to us on the road and explained the Scriptures to us” (Luke 24:32).\nNext time you’re disappointed, don’t panic. Don’t give up. Just be patient and let God remind you he’s still in control. It ain’t over till it’s over. ',
