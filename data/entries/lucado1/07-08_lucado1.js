I’m curious about what bolsters this man as he nears his execution. So I ask some questions.\nDo you have family, Paul? I have none.\nWhat about your health? My body is beaten and tired… .\nAny awards? Not on earth.\nThen what do you have, Paul? No belongings. No family… . What do you have that matters?\nI have my faith. It’s all I have. But it’s all I need. I have kept the faith.\nPaul leans back against the wall of his cell and smiles. ',
