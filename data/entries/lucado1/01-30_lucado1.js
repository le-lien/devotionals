If so, you remember that “splanchnology” is a study of … the gut.\nWhen Matthew writes that Jesus had compassion on the people, he is not saying that Jesus felt casual pity for them. No, the term is far more graphic.\nMatthew is saying that Jesus felt their hurt in his gut: He felt the limp of the crippled.\nHe felt the hurt of the diseased.\nHe felt the loneliness of the leper.\nHe felt the embarrassment of the sinful.\nAnd once he felt their hurts, he couldn’t help but heal their hurts.
