I took her to the restroom and set out some tweezers, ointment, and a Band-Aid.\nShe didn’t like what she saw. “I just want the Band-Aid, Daddy.”\nSometimes we are just like Andrea. We come to Christ with our sin, but all we want is a covering. We want to skip the treatment. We want to hide our sin. And one wonders if God, even in his great mercy, will heal what we conceal.\nHow can God heal what we deny? How can God touch what we cover up? ',
