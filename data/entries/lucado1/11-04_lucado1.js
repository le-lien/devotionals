It takes a massive effort to finish strong.\nLikely you’ve noticed that many don’t? Surely you’ve observed there are many on the side of the trail? They used to be running. There was a time when they kept the pace. But then weariness set in. They didn’t think the run would be this tough… .\nBy contrast, Jesus’ best work was his final work, and his strongest step was his last step. Our Master is the classic example of one who endured… .\nHe could have quit the race. But he didn’t. ',
