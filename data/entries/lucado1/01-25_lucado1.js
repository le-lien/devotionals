Here is how it happens. You come before the judgment seat of God full of rebellion and mistakes.\nBecause of his justice he cannot dismiss your sin, but because of his love he cannot dismiss you. So, in an act which stunned the heavens, he punished himself on the cross for your sins. God’s justice and love are equally honored. And you, God’s creation, are forgiven. But the story doesn’t end with God’s forgiveness… .\nIt would be enough if God just cleansed your name, but he does more. He gives you his  name. ',
