I try to envision his skeletal hand gripping the broken glass or stone that cut into the wall. I try to imagine his eyes squinting through the darkness as he carved each letter.\nWhat hand could have cut such a conviction? What eyes could have seen good in such horror?\nThere is only one answer: Eyes that chose to see the unseen. ',
