Death will make widows and devastation will destroy countries. We should not expect any less. But just because the devil shows up and cackles, we needn’t panic.\nOur Master speaks of an accomplished deed. . . . “It is finished” (John 19:30). The battle is over. Be alert. But don’t be alarmed. . . . The manuscript has been published. The book has been bound. Satan is loosed for a season, but the season is oh-so-brief… . Just a few more scenes, just a few more turns in the road, and his end will come. ',
