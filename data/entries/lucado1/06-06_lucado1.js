It’s not like you are blazing a trail as you grow older. It’s not as if no one has ever done it before. Look around you.\nYou have ample opportunity to prepare and ample case studies to consider.\nIf growing old catches you by surprise, don’t blame God. He gave you plenty of warning. He also gave you plenty of advice.\nYour last chapters can be your best. Your final song can be your greatest.\nIt could be that all of your life has prepared you for a grand exit. God’s oldest have always been among his choicest. ',
