Our only hope is that God will do for us what he did for the man at Bethesda—that he will step out of the temple and step into our ward of hurt and helplessness.\nWhich is exactly what he has done… .\nI wish we would take Jesus at his word… .\nWhen he says we’re forgiven, let’s unload the guilt.\nWhen he says we’re valuable, let’s believe him… .\nWhen he says we’re provided for, let’s stop worrying.\nGod’s efforts are strongest when our efforts are useless.
