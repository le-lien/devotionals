    "body": 'Anger.  It’s easy to define: the noise of the soul. Anger.  The unseen irritant of the heart. Anger.  The relentless invader of silence… .\nThe louder it gets the more desperate we become… .\nSome of you are thinking … you don’t have any idea how hard my life has been. And you’re right, I don’t. But I have a very clear idea how miserable your future will be unless you deal with your anger.\nX-ray the world of the vengeful and behold the tumor of bitterness: black, menacing, malignant. Carcinoma of the spirit. Its fatal fibers creep around the edge of the heart and ravage it. Yesterday you can’t alter, but your reaction to yesterday you can. The past you cannot change, but your response to your past you can. ',
