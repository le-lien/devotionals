And we are to speak truthfully.\nOur task is not to whitewash nor bloat the truth. Our task is to tell the truth.\nPeriod.\nThere is, however, one difference between the witness in court and the witness for Christ. The witness in court eventually steps down from the witness chair, but the witness for Christ never does. Since the claims of Christ are always on trial, court is perpetually in session, and we remain under oath. ',
