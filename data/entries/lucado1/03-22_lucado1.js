But you would rather be a cynic than a hypocrite, so you continue to pray with one eye open and wonder:\nabout starving children\nabout the power of prayer\nabout Christians in cancer wards …\nTough questions. Throw-in-the-towel questions. Questions the disciples must have asked in the storm.\nAll they could see were black skies as they bounced in the battered boat. .\n. .\n[Then] a figure came to them walking on the water. It wasn’t what they expected… . They almost missed seeing the answer to their prayers.\nAnd unless we look and listen closely, we risk making the same mistake.\nGod’s lights in our dark nights are as numerous as the stars, if only we’ll look for them.
