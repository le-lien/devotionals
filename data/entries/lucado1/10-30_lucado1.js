You can’t take the heat out of fire and still have fire.\nIn the same way, you can’t take the love out of [God]… and still have him exist. For he was … and is … Love.\nProbe deep within him. Explore every corner. Search every angle. Love is all you find. Go to the beginning of every decision he has made and you’ll find it. Go to the end of every story he has told and you’ll see it.\nLove.\nNo bitterness. No evil. No cruelty. Just love. Flawless love. Passionate love. Vast and pure love. He is love. ',
