    "body": 'Bitterness is its own prison.\nThe sides are slippery with resentment. A floor of muddy anger stills the feet. The stench of betrayal fills the air and stings the eyes. A cloud of self-pity blocks the view of the tiny exit above.\nStep in and look at the prisoners. Victims are chained to the walls.\nVictims of betrayal. Victims of abuse.\nThe dungeon, deep and dark, is beckoning you to enter… . You can, you know. You’ve experienced enough hurt… . You can choose, like many, to chain yourself to your hurt… . Or you can choose, like some, to put away your hurts before they become hates… .\nHow does God deal with your bitter heart? He reminds you that what you have is more important than what you don’t have. You still have your relationship with God. No one can take that. ',
