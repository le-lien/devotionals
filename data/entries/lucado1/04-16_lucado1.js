    "body": 'Tolerance. A prized virtue today. The ability to be understanding of those with whom you differ is a sign of sophistication. Jesus, too, was a champion of tolerance:\n• Tolerant of the disciples when they doubted.\n• Tolerant of the crowds when they misunderstood.\n• Tolerant of us when we fall.\nBut there is one area where Jesus was intolerant. There was one area where he was unindulgent and dogmatic… .\nAs far as he was concerned, when it comes to salvation, there aren’t several roads … there is only one road… . There aren’t several paths …\nthere is only one path. And that path is Jesus himself.\nThat is why it is so hard for people to believe in Jesus. It’s much easier to consider him one of several options rather than the option. But such a philosophy is no option. ',
