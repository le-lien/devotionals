    "body": 'The purpose of worship is to change the face of the worshiper. That is exactly what happened to Christ on the mountain. Jesus’ appearance was changed: “His face became bright like the sun” (Matt. 17:2).\nThe connection between the face and worship is more than coincidental.\nOur face is the most public part of our bodies, covered less than any other area. It is also the most recognizable part of our bodies. We don’t fill a school annual with photos of people’s feet but rather with photos of faces.\nGod desires to take our faces, this exposed and memorable part of our bodies, and use them to reflect his goodness.
