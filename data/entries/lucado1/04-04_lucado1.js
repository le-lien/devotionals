As he would hang on the cross he would say, “It is finished”. . . the debt is paid!\nThere are some facts that will never change. One fact is that you are forgiven. If you are in Christ, when he sees you, your sins are covered—he doesn’t see them. He sees you better than you see yourself. And that is a glorious fact of your life. ',
