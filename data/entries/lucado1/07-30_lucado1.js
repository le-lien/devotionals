    "body": 'Paul had an interesting observation about the way we treat people.\nHe said it about marriage, but the principle applies in any relationship. “The man who loves his wife loves himself” (Eph. 5:28). There is a correlation between the way you feel about yourself and the way you feel about others.\nIf you are at peace with yourself—if you like yourself—you will get along with others.\nThe converse is also true. If you don’t like yourself, if you are ashamed, embarrassed, or angry, other people are going to know it… .\nWhich takes us to the question, “How does a person get relief?” …\n“Come to me, all of you who are tired and have heavy loads, and I will give you rest” (Matt. 11:28)… . Jesus says he is the solution for weariness of soul. ',
