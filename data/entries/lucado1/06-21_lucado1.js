You’re the one God is seeking.\nGod is the waiting Father, the caring Shepherd in search of his lamb. His legs are scratched, his feet are sore, and his eyes are burning. He scales the cliffs and traverses the fields. He explores the caves. He cups his hands to his mouth and calls into the canyon.\nAnd the name he calls is yours… .\nThe message is simple: God gave up his Son in order to rescue all his sons and daughters. To bring his children home. He’s listening for your answer. ',
