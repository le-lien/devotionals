Were Paul’s question,\n“Who can be against us?” we could list our foes much easier than we could fight them. But that is not the question. The question is, If GOD IS FOR\nUS, who can be against us?\nGod is for you. Your parents may have forgotten you, your teachers may have neglected you, your siblings may be ashamed of you; but within reach of your prayers is the maker of the oceans. God! ',
