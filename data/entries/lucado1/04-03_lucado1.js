And when he spoke with his Father, you were in his prayers… .\nAnd God couldn’t turn his back on you. He couldn’t because he saw you, and one look at you was all it took to convince him. Right there in the middle of a world which isn’t fair. He saw you cast into a river of life you didn’t request. He saw you betrayed by those you love. He saw you with a body which gets sick and a heart which grows weak… .\nOn the eve of the cross, Jesus made his decision. He would rather go to hell for you than go to heaven without you. ',
