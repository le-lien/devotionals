    "body": 'I like the story of the little boy who fell out of bed. When his mom asked him what happened, he answered, “I don’t know. I guess I stayed too close to where I got in.”\nEasy to do the same with our faith. It’s tempting just to stay where we got in and never move.\nPick a time in the not-too-distant past. A year or two ago. Now ask yourself a few questions. How does your prayer life today compare with then? How about your giving? Have both the amount and the joy increased?\nWhat about your church loyalty? Can you tell you’ve grown? And Bible study? Are you learning to learn? …\nDon’t make the mistake of the little boy. Don’t stay too close to where you got in. It’s risky resting on the edge. ',
