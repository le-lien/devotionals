But as soon as the infraction is read, grace is proclaimed… .\nThe result? God’s merciful verdict will echo through the universe. For the first time in history, we will understand the depth of his goodness.\nItemized grace. Catalogued kindness. Registered forgiveness. We will stand in awe as one sin after another is proclaimed, and then pardoned… .\nThe devil will shrink back in defeat. The angels will step forward in awe.\nAnd we saints will stand tall in God’s grace. As we see how much he has forgiven us, we will see how much he loves us. And we will worship him.\nThe result will be the first genuine community of forgiven people. Only one is worthy of the applause of heaven, and he’s the one with the pierced hands and feet. ',
