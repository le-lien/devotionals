    "body": 'To pray, “Thy will be done” is to seek the heart of God. The word will  means “strong desire.” . . . [So] what is his heart? His passion? He wants you to know it.\nShall God hide from us what he is going to do? Apparently not, for he has gone to great lengths to reveal his will to us. Could he have done more than send his Son to lead us? Could he have done more than give his word to teach us? Could he have done more than orchestrate events to awaken us? Could he have done more than send his Holy Spirit to counsel us?\nGod is not the God of confusion, and wherever he sees sincere seekers with confused hearts, you can bet your sweet December that he will do whatever it takes to help them see his will.
