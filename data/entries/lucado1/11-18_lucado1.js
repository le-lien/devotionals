Lofty promise.\nOne promises acceptance, the other a cross.\nOne offers flesh and flash, the other offers faith.\nThe crowd challenges, “Follow us and fit in.”\nJesus promises, “Follow me and stand out.”\nThey promise to please. God promises to save.\nGod looks at you and asks, “Which will be your choice?” ',
