Didn’t have to. Could have just laid the Savior on a doorstep. Would have been simpler that way. And why does God tell us their stories? …\nSimple… . He wants us to know that when the world goes wild, he stays calm.\nWant proof? Read the last name on the list [of Jesus’ lineage]. In spite of all the crooked halos and tasteless gambols of his people, the last name on the list is the first one promised—Jesus.\nNo more names are listed. No more are needed. As if God is announcing to a doubting world, “See, I did it. Just like I said I would.” ',
