What is now faulty will be fixed.\nYour body will be different, but you won’t have a different body. You will have this one. Does that change the view you have of it? I hope so.\nGod has a high regard for your body. You should as well. Respect it. I did not say worship it. But I did say respect it. It is after all the temple of God.\nBe careful how you feed it, use it, and maintain it. You wouldn’t want anyone trashing your home; God doesn’t want anyone trashing his. After all, it is his, isn’t it? ',
