Others become weeds. Sow seeds of hope and enjoy optimism.\nSow seeds of doubt and expect insecurity… .\nThe proof is everywhere you look. Ever wonder why some people have the Teflon capacity to resist negativism and remain patient, optimistic, and forgiving? Could it be that they have diligently sown seeds of goodness and are enjoying the harvest?\nEver wonder why others have such a sour outlook? Such a gloomy attitude? You would, too, if your heart were a greenhouse of weeds and thorns. ',
