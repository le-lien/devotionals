God is using today’s difficulties to strengthen you for tomorrow. He is equipping  you. The God who makes things grow will help you bear fruit.\nDwell on the fact that God lives within you. Think about the power that gives you life. The realization that God is dwelling within you may change the places you want to go and the things you want to do today.\nDo what is right this week, whatever it is, whatever comes down the path, whatever problems and dilemmas you face—just do what’s right.\nMaybe no one else is doing what’s right, but you do what’s right. You be honest. You take a stand. You be true. After all, regardless of what you do, God does what is right: he saves you with his grace. ',
