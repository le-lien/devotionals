That’s like God telling a housewife to stand up to her abusive husband or a high school student to take on drug peddlers or a preacher to preach the truth to a congregation of Pharisees. “Y-y-you-b-b-better get somebody else,” we stammer. But then God reminds us that he knows we can’t, but he can, and to prove it he gives a wonderful gift. He brings a spirit of peace. A peace before the storm. A peace beyond logic…\n. He gave it to David after he showed him Goliath; he gave it to Saul after he showed him the gospel; he gave it to Jesus after he showed him the cross. And he gave it to Gideon. So Gideon, in turn, gave the name to God.\nHe built an altar and named it Jehovah-shalom, the Lord is peace (Judges 65:24).\nThe Great House of God\nFebruary\nThe LORD is close to everyone who prays to him, to all who truly pray to him.
