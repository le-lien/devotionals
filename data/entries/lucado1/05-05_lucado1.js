Try to undo your mistakes; he will thwart you.\nThis expert witness has no higher goal than to take you to court and press charges… . Who is he? The devil… .\nHe rails: “This one you call your child, God. He is not worthy… .”\nAs he speaks, you hang your head. You have no defense. His charges are fair. “I plead guilty, your honor,” you mumble.\n“The sentence?” Satan asks.\n“The wages of sin is death,” explains the judge, “but in this case the death has already occurred. For this one died with Christ.”\nSatan is suddenly silent. And you are suddenly jubilant. . . . You have stood before the judge and heard him declare, “Not guilty.” ',
