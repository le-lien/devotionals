Rely upon him for your affirmation and encouragement. Look at Paul’s words: “you are God’s child, and God will give you the blessing he promised,  because you are his child” (Gal. 4:7, emphasis added).\nHaving your family’s approval is desirable but not necessary for happiness and not always possible. Jesus did not let the difficult dynamic of his family overshadow his call from God. And because he didn’t, [his family] chapter has a happy ending… .\nHe gave them space, time, and grace. And because he did, they changed.\n. . . One brother became an apostle (Gal. 1:19) and others became missionaries (1 Cor. 9:5). ',
