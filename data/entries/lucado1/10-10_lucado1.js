    "body": 'Great question. What kind of people should we be? Peter tells us:\n“You should live holy lives and serve God, as you wait for and look forward to the coming of the day of God” (vv. 11–12).\nHope of the future is not a license for irresponsibility in the present. Let us wait forwardly, but let us wait.\nBut for most of us, waiting is not our problem. Or, maybe I should state, waiting is  our problem. We are so good at waiting that we don’t wait forwardly. We forget to look… . We are too content. We seldom search the skies… .We seldom, if ever, allow the Holy Spirit to interrupt our plans and lead us to worship so that we might see Jesus. ',
