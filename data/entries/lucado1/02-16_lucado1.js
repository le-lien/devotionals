And he promises it to an unlikely crowd:\n• “The poor in spirit.” Beggars in God’s soup kitchen. • “Those who mourn.” Sinners Anonymous bound together by the truth of their introduction: “Hi, I am me. I’m a sinner.” …\n• “The merciful.” Winners of the million-dollar lottery who share the prize with their enemies.\n• “The pure in heart.” Physicians who love lepers and escape infection.\n• “The peacemakers.” Architects who build bridges with wood from a Roman cross… .\n• “The persecuted.” Those who manage to keep an eye on heaven while walking through hell on earth.\nIt is to this band of pilgrims that God promises a special blessing. A heavenly joy. A sacred delight. ',
