    "body": 'God has enlisted us in his navy and placed us on his ship. The boat has one purpose—to carry us safely to the other shore.\nThis is no cruise ship; it’s a battleship. We aren’t called to a life of leisure; we are called to a life of service. Each of us has a different task.\nSome, concerned with those who are drowning, are snatching people from the water. Others are occupied with the enemy, so they man the cannons of prayer and worship. Still others devote themselves to the crew, feeding and training the crew members.\nThough different, we are the same. Each can tell of a personal encounter with the captain, for each has received a personal call… .\nWe each followed him across the gangplank of his grace onto the same boat. There is one captain and one destination. Though the battle is fierce, the boat is safe, for our captain is God. The ship will not sink. For that, there is no concern. ',
