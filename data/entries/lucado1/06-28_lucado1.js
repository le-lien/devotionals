Does the fire of anger boil within you, with leaping flames consuming your emotions? Or do you reach somewhere, to some source of cool water and pull out a bucket of mercy—to free yourself?\nDon’t get on the roller coaster of resentment and anger. You be the one who says, “Yes, he mistreated me, but I am going to be like Christ. I’ll be the one who says, ‘Forgive them, Father, they don’t know what they’re doing.’” ',
