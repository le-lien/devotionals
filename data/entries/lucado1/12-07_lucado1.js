    "body": 'What have you done today to avoid death? Likely a lot. You’ve popped pills, pumped pecks, passed on the pie, and pursued the polyunsaturates… . Why? Why the effort? Because you are worried about staying alive. That won’t be a worry in heaven.\nIn fact, you won’t be worrying at all. Some of you moms worry about your kids getting hurt. You won’t worry in heaven. In heaven we’ll feel no pain. Some of you fellows worry about getting old. You won’t in heaven.\nWe’ll all be ceaselessly strong… .\nWe are not made of steel, we are made of dust. And this life is not crowned with life, it is crowned with death.\nThe next life, however, is different. Jesus urged the Christians in Smyrna to “be faithful, even if you have to die, and I will give you the crown of life” (Rev. 2:10). ',
