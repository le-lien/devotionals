    "body": '[To those who embrace Christ as Savior,] he has promised a new birth.\nDoes that mean the old nature will never rear its ugly head? Does that mean you will instantly be able to resist any temptation?\nTo answer that question, compare your new birth in Christ to a newborn baby. Can a newborn walk? Can he feed himself? Can he sing or read or speak? No, not yet. But someday he will.\nIt takes time to grow. But is the parent in the delivery room ashamed of the baby? Is the mom embarrassed that the infant can’t spell . . . that the baby can’t walk … that the newborn can’t give a speech?\nOf course not. The parents aren’t ashamed; they are proud. They know that growth will come with time. So does God. ',
