Jesus understands. Your teenagers won’t listen? Your students won’t try? Jesus knows how you feel.\nYou are precious to him. So precious that he became like you so that you would come to him.\nWhen you struggle, he listens. When you yearn, he responds. When you question, he hears. He has been there. ',
