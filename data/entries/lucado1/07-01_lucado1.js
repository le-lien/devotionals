The courtroom of complaint.\nSome of you are rehashing the same hurt every chance you get with anyone who will listen.\nFor you, I have this question: Who made you God? I don’t mean to be cocky, but why are you doing his work for him?\n“Vengeance is Mine,” God declared. “I will repay” (Heb. 10:30 NKJV).\nJudgment is God’s job. To assume otherwise is to assume God can’t do it.\nRevenge is irreverent. . . . To forgive someone is to display reverence.\nForgiveness is not saying the one who hurt you was right. Forgiveness is stating that God is faithful and he will do what is right. ',
