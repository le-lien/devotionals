    "body": 'In the third century, St. Cyprian wrote to a friend named Donatus: This seems a cheerful world, Donatus, when I view it from this fair garden. . . . But if I climbed some great mountain and looked out … you know very well what I would see; brigands on the high road, pirates on the seas, in the amphitheaters men murdered to please the applauding crowds… .\nYet in the midst of it, I have found a quiet and holy people. . . . They are despised and persecuted, but they care not. They have overcome the world. These people, Donatus, are Christians… .\nWhat a compliment! A quiet and holy people… .\nQuiet… . Not obnoxious. Not boastful. Not demanding. Just quiet… .\nHoly… . Set apart. Pure. Decent. Honest. Wholesome… . ',
