    "body": 'It’s easy to thank God when he does what we want. But God doesn’t always do what we want. Ask Job.\nHis empire collapsed, his children were killed, and what was a healthy body became a rage of boils. From whence came this torrent? From whence will come any help?\nJob goes straight to God and pleads his case. His head hurts. His body hurts. His heart hurts.\nAnd God answers. Not with answers but with questions. An ocean of questions… .\nAfter several dozen questions … Job has gotten the point. What is it?\nThe point is this: God owes no one anything. No reasons. No explanations. Nothing. If he gave them, we couldn’t understand them.\nGod is God. He knows what he is doing. When you can’t trace his hand, trust his heart. ',
