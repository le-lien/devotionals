He will touch and tug. He will take away our burdens; he’ll even take away our blessings. If there are a thousand steps between us and him, he will take all but one. But he will leave the final one for us. The choice is ours.\nPlease understand. His goal is not to make you happy. His goal is to make you his. His goal is not to get you what you want; it is to get you what you need.\nA Gentle Thunder\nSeptember\nLet us hold firmly to the hope that we have confessed, because we can trust God to do what he promised.
