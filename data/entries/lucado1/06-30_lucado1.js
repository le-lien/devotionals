    "body": 'When does salvation come?\nWhen we look to Christ. When we embrace him as Savior. Astonishingly simple, isn’t it? Claim the great promise of John 3:16: “God loved the world so much that he gave his one and only Son so that whoever believes in him may not be lost, but have eternal life.”\nGod, the Lover. God, the Giver. God, the Savior.\nAnd man, the believer. And for those who believe, he has promised a new birth.\nBut despite the simplicity, there are still those who don’t believe. They don’t trust the promise… .\nIf only they would try. If only they would test it. But God is as polite as he is passionate. He never forces his way in. The choice is theirs.\nA Gentle Thunder\nJuly\nJesus spoke to them, saying, “Be of good cheer! It is I; do not be afraid.” ',
