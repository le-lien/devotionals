    "body": 'John tells us, “We are being cleansed  from every sin by the blood of Jesus.” In other words, we are always being cleansed.  The cleansing is not a promise for the future but a reality in the present. Let a speck of dust fall on the soul of a saint, and it is washed away. Let a spot of filth land on the heart of God’s child, and the filth is wiped away… .\nOur Savior kneels down and gazes upon the darkest acts of our lives. But rather than recoil in horror, he reaches out in kindness and says, “I can clean that if you want.” And from the basin of his grace, he scoops a palm full of mercy and washes away our sin.\nBut that’s not all he does. Because he lives in us, you and I can do the same. Because he has forgiven us, we can forgive others. ',
