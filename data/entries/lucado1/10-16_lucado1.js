    "body": 'The Bible has been banned, burned, scoffed, and ridiculed. Scholars have mocked it as foolish. Kings have branded it as illegal. A thousand times over it the grave has been dug, and the dirge has begun, but somehow the Bible never stays in the grave. Not only has it survived, it has thrived. It is the single most popular book in all of history. It has been the best-selling book in the world for years!\nThere is no way on earth to explain it. Which perhaps is the only explanation. The answer? The Bible’s durability is not found on earth; it is found in heaven. For the millions who have tested its claims and claimed its promises there is but one answer— the Bible is God’s book and God’s voice\n… .\nThe purpose of the Bible is to proclaim God’s plan and passion to save his children. That is the reason this book has endured through the centuries.\n… It is the treasure map that leads us to God’s highest treasure, eternal life. ',
