He sacrificed himself to give us a second chance.\nHe would have gone to any lengths to do so. And he did. He went to the cross, where man’s utter despair collided with God’s unbending grace. And in that moment when God’s great gift was complete, the compassionate Christ showed the world the cost of his gift… .\nHe who was perfect gave that perfect record to us, and our imperfect record was given to him… . As a result, God’s holiness is honored and his children are forgiven. ',
