    "body": 'Think about the day Christ comes. There you are in the great circle of the redeemed. . . . Though you are one of a throng, it’s as if you and Jesus are all alone… .\nI’m speculating now, but I wonder if Christ might say these words to you: “I’m so proud that you let me use you. Because of you, others are here today. Would you like to meet them?” …\nAt that point Jesus might turn to the crowd and invite them… . One by one, they begin to step out and walk forward.\nThe first is your neighbor, a crusty old sort who lived next door. To be frank, you didn’t expect to see him. “You never knew I was watching,” he explains, “but I was. And because of you, I am here.” …\nIt’s not long before you and your Savior are encircled by the delightful collection of souls you’ve touched. Some you know, most you don’t, but for each you feel the same… . You feel what Paul felt … “I’m so proud of your faith” (see 1 Thess. 2:19). ',
