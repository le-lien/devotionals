    "body": 'Most of my life I’ve been a closet slob… . Then I got married… .\nI enrolled in a twelve-step program for slobs. (“My name is Max, I hate to vacuum.”) A physical therapist helped me rediscover the muscles used for hanging shirts… . My nose was reintroduced to the fragrance of Pine Sol… .\nThen came the moment of truth. Denalyn went out of town for a week.\nInitially I reverted to the old man. I figured I’d be a slob for six days and clean on the seventh. But something strange happened, a curious discomfort. I couldn’t relax with dirty dishes in the sink.\nWhat had happened to me? Simple. I’d been exposed to a higher standard.\nIsn’t that what has happened with us? … Before Christ our lives were out of control, sloppy, and indulgent. We didn’t even know we were slobs until we met him… . Suddenly we find ourselves wanting to do good. Go back to the old mess? Are you kidding? ',
