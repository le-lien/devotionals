    "body": 'Is there anything more frail than a bruised reed? Look at the bruised reed at the water’s edge. A once slender and tall stalk of sturdy river grass, it is now bowed and bent.\nAre you a bruised reed? Was it so long ago that you stood so tall, so proud? …\nThen something happened. You were bruised …\nby harsh words\nby a friend’s anger\nby a spouse’s betrayal… .\nThe bruised reed… . Society knows what to do with you… . The world will break you off; the world will snuff you out.\nBut the artists of Scripture proclaim that God won’t. Painted on canvas after canvas is the tender touch of a Creator who has a special place for the bruised and weary of the world. A God who is the friend of the wounded heart. ',
