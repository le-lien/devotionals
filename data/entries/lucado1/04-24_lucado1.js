    "body": 'If we are already forgiven, then why does Jesus teach us to pray,\n“Forgive us our debts”?\nThe very reason you would want your children to do the same. If my children violate one of my standards or disobey a rule, I don’t disown them.\nI don’t kick them out of the house or tell them to change their last name.\nBut I do expect them to be honest and apologize. And until they do, the tenderness of our relationship will suffer. The nature of the relationship won’t be altered, but the intimacy will.\nThe same happens in our walk with God. Confession does not create a relationship with God, it simply nourishes it. If you are a believer, admission of sins does not alter your position before God, but it does enhance your peace with God.
