    "body": 'God’s judgment [on the day Christ returns] is based upon humanity’s response to the message received. He will never hold us accountable for what he doesn’t tell us. At the same time, he will never let us die without telling us something. Even those who never heard of Christ are given a message about the character of God. “The heavens declare the glory of God” (Ps. 19:1 NIV)… .\nNature is God’s first missionary. Where there is no Bible, there are sparkling stars. Where there are no preachers, there are springtimes… . If a person has nothing but nature, then nature is enough to reveal something about God. As Paul says … : “God’s law is not something alien, imposed on us from without, but woven into the very fabric of our creation. There is something deep within [people] that echoes God’s yes and no, right and wrong. Their response to God’s yes and no will become public knowledge on the day God makes his final decision about every man and woman”\n(Rom. 2:15–16 MSG). ',
