He was a Christian-killer before he was a Christian leader. At times his heart was so heavy, Paul’s pen drug itself across the page. “What a miserable man I am! Who will save me from this body that brings me death?” (Rom. 7:24).\nOnly heaven knows how long he stared at the question before he found the courage to defy logic and write, “I thank God for saving me through Jesus Christ our Lord!” (Rom. 7:25).
