A figure came to them walking on the water. It wasn’t what they expected. Perhaps they were looking for angels to descend or heaven to open… . We don’t know what they were looking for.\nBut one thing is for sure, they weren’t looking for Jesus to come walking on the water… .\nAnd since Jesus came in a way they didn’t expect, they almost missed seeing the answer to their prayers.\nAnd unless we look and listen closely, we risk making the same mistake.\nGod’s lights in our dark nights are as numerous as the stars, if only we’ll look for them.
