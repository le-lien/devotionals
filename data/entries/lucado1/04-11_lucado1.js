    "body": 'He looked around the hill and foresaw a scene. Three figures hung on three crosses. Arms spread. Heads fallen forward. They moaned with the wind.\nMen clad in soldier’s garb sat on the ground near the trio… .\nWomen clad in sorrow huddled at the foot of the hill, . . . faces tear-streaked.\nAll heaven stood to fight. All nature rose to rescue. All eternity poised to protect. But the Creator gave no command.\n“It must be done …” he said, and withdrew.\nThe angel spoke again. “It would be less painful …”\nThe Creator interrupted softly. “But it wouldn’t be love.” ',
