If God doesn’t make doctrinal perfection a requirement for family membership, should I?\nAnd if we never agree, can’t we agree to disagree? If God can tolerate my mistakes, can’t I tolerate the mistakes of others? … If God allows me with my foibles and failures to call him Father, shouldn’t I extend the same grace to others? ',
