I have heard the official answers. “To gratify the old law.” “To fulfill prophecy.” And these answers are right. They are.\nBut there is something more here. Something very compassionate.\nSomething yearning. Something personal.\nWhat is it?\nCould it be that his heart was broken for all the people who cast despairing eyes toward the dark heavens and cry the same “Why?” Could it be that his heart was broken for the hurting? …\nI imagine him, bending close to those who hurt. I imagine him listening. I picture his eyes misting and a pierced hand brushing away a tear… . He who also was once alone, understands. ',
