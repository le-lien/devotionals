    "body": 'It all happened in a most remarkable moment … a moment like no other… .\nGod became a man. Divinity arrived. Heaven opened herself and placed her most precious one in a human womb.\nThe omnipotent, in one instant, became flesh and blood. The one who was larger than the universe became a microscopic embryo. And he who sustains the world with a word chose to be dependent upon the nourishment of a young girl.\nGod had come near. ',
