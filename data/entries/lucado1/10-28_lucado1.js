From his perspective every person is either: Entering through the small gate or the wide gate (Matt. 7:13–14) …\nHeaven called or hell bound (Mark 16:15–16) … .\nOur ledger, however, is cluttered with unnecessary columns. Is he rich? Is she pretty? What work does he do? What color is her skin? Does she have a college degree? These matters are irrelevant to God… .\nTo have a heart like his is to look into the faces of the saved and rejoice!\nThey are just one grave away from being just like Jesus. To have a heart like his is to look into the faces of the lost and pray. For unless they turn, they are one grave away from torment. ',
