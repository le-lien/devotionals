    "body": 'Just prior to his crucifixion, [Jesus] told his disciples that he would be leaving them. “Where I am going you cannot follow now, but you will follow later” (John 13:36).\nSuch a statement was bound to stir some questions. Peter spoke for the others and asked, “Lord, why can’t I follow you now?” (v. 37).\nSee if Jesus’ reply doesn’t reflect the tenderness of a parent to a child:\n“Don’t let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God, and trust in me. There are many rooms in my Father’s house; I would not tell you this it if were not true. I am going there to prepare a place for you… . I will come back and take you to be with me so that you may be where I am going” (John 14:1–\n3).\nReduce the paragraph to a sentence and it might read: “You do the trusting and I’ll do the taking.” ',
