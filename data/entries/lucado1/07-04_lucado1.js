Examples?\nHow much time do you have?\nDavid the psalmist becomes David the voyeur, but by God’s grace becomes David the psalmist again.\nPeter denied Christ before he preached Christ.\nZacchaeus, the crook. The cleanest part of his life was the money he’d laundered. But Jesus still had time for him.\nThe thief on the cross: hell-bent and hung-out-to-die one minute, heaven-bound and smiling the next.\nStory after story. Prayer after prayer. Surprise after surprise. Seems that God is looking more for ways to get us home than for ways to keep us out. I challenge you to find one soul who came to God seeking grace and did not find it. ',
