You might alter things a day or two with money and systems, but the heart of the matter is and always will be, the matter of the heart.\nAllow me to get specific. Our problem is sin. Not finances. Not budgets. .\n. . Our problem is sin. We are in rebellion against our Creator. We are separated from our Father. We are cut off from the source of life. A new president or policy won’t fix that. It can only be solved by God.\nThat’s why the Bible uses drastic terms like conversion, repentance,  and lost  and found. Society may renovate, but only God re-creates. ',
