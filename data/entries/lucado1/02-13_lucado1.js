Don’t listen to the whines of those who have settled for a second-rate life and want you to do the same so they won’t feel guilty. Your goal is not to live long; it’s to live.\nJesus says the options are clear. On one side there is the voice of safety.\nYou can build a fire in the hearth, stay inside, and stay warm and dry and safe… .\nOr you can hear the voice of adventure—God’s adventure. Instead of building a fire in your hearth, build a fire in your heart. Follow God’s impulses. Adopt the child. Move overseas. Teach the class. Change careers.\nRun for office. Make a difference. Sure it isn’t safe, but what is? ',
