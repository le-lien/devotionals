    "body": 'The white space between Bible verses is fertile soil for questions.\nOne can hardly read Scripture without whispering, “I wonder …”\n“I wonder if Eve ever ate any more fruit.”\n“I wonder if Noah slept well during storms.” …\nBut in our wonderings, there is one question we never need to ask. Does God care? Do we matter to God? Does he still love his children?\nThrough the small face of the stable-born baby, he says yes.\nYes, your sins are forgiven.\nYes, your name is written in heaven… .\nAnd yes, God has entered your world. Immanuel. God is with us. ',
