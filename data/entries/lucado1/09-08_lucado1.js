With your background and experience and talent and wisdom and love for kids and degree in accounting, YOU are the perfect one for the job!”…\nIt’s tug-of-war, and you are the rope… .\n“Blessed are the meek,” Jesus said. The word meek  does not mean weak.\nIt means focused. It is a word used to describe a domesticated stallion.\nPower under control… .\nBlessed are those who recognize their God-given responsibilities.\nBlessed are those who acknowledge that there is only one God and have quit applying for his position. Blessed are those who know what on earth they are on earth to do and set themselves about the business of doing it. ',
