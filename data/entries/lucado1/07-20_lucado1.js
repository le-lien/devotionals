And—all that he is, you will be, for you will be like Jesus. Wasn’t that the promise of John?\n“We know that when Christ comes again, we will be like him, because we will see him as he really is” (1 John 3:2).\nSince you’ll be pure as snow, you will never sin again; … you will never stumble again; . . . you will never feel lonely again; . . . you will never doubt again.\nWhen Christ comes, you will dwell in the light of God. And you will see him as he really is. ',
