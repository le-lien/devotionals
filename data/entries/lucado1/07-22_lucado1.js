    "body": 'Maybe your past isn’t much to brag about. Maybe you’ve seen raw evil. And now you … have to make a choice. Do you rise above the past and make a difference? Or do you remain controlled by the past and make excuses? …\nMany choose the convalescent homes of the heart. Healthy bodies. Sharp minds. But retired dreams. Back and forth they rock in the chair of regret, repeating the terms of surrender. Lean closely and you will hear them: “If only.”\n“If only I’d been born somewhere else …”\n“If only I’d been treated fairly …”\nMaybe you’ve used those words. Maybe you have every right to use them… . If such is the case … go to John’s gospel and read Jesus’ words:\n“Human life comes from human parents, but spiritual life comes from the Spirit” (John 3:6).
