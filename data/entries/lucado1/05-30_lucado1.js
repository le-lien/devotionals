    "body": 'Matthew writes that Jesus “healed their sick.” Not some  of their sick. Not the righteous  among the sick. Not the deserving  among the sick.\nBut “the sick.”\nSurely, among the many thousands, there were a few people unworthy of good health. The same divinity that gave Jesus the power to heal also gave him the power to perceive… . I wonder if Jesus was tempted to say to the bigot, “Get out of here, buddy, and take your arrogance with you.”\nAnd he could see not only their past, he could see their future.\nUndoubtedly, there were those in the multitude who would use their newfound health to hurt others. Jesus released tongues that would someday curse. He gave sight to eyes that would lust. He healed hands that would kill… .\nEach time Jesus healed, he had to overlook the future and the past.\nSomething, by the way, that he still does. ',
