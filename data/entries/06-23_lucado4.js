So when you decide to make a relationship work—to get along—you have to remember that people will still make mistakes, will still get on your nerves sometimes, will still hurt your feelings.\nSo how do you get along with others? Look at what God says in Romans 12:10–18: “Give your brothers and sisters more honor than you want for yourselves. . . . Wish good for those who do bad things to you. . . . Be happy with those who are happy. Be sad with those who are sad. . . . If someone does wrong to you, do not pay him back by doing wrong to him. .\n. . Do your best to live in peace with everyone.”\nIn other words … choose to love. ',
