    "body": 'If the New Testament has a con artist, Zacchaeus is the man. He never met a person he couldn’t swindle or saw a dollar he couldn’t hustle. He was a\n“chief tax collector” (Luke 19:2). First-century tax collectors cheated anything that walked. But when Jesus and his followers traveled through Jericho, even the local tax collector wanted a look. Jesus spotted him in a sycamore tree and said, “Zacchaeus, come down immediately. I must stay at your house today” (v. 5 NIV). Of all the homes in town, Jesus selected Zack’s.\nZacchaeus was never quite the same. “Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount” (v. 8 NIV). Despite Zacchaeus’s bad choices, despite his dishonest past, Jesus offered him kindness and a seat at heaven’s table. Jesus offered him grace. And when that grace walked in the front door, selfishness scampered out the back. It changed the tax collector’s heart.\nIs grace changing yours? ',
