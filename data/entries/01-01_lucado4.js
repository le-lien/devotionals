No need to worry about being ignored. God never says, “Not right now.”\nEven if your words come out wrong ... even if what you have to say doesn’t seem important to anyone else, it’s important to God, and He listens.\nHe listens in the morning and in the night ... and even in math class. He listens to the joy of the ballplayer who makes the game-winning play ... and to the tears of the one who didn’t. He listens to the sadness of someone who is sick ... and to the fears of someone facing the first day in a new school. When the lonely ask for a friend and the frightened ask for courage, God listens.\n<i>Very carefully.</i>',
