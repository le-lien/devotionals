    "body": 'The Bible calls Jesus the Shepherd and calls us His sheep. I wonder if Jesus doesn’t give a slight grin as He sees one of His lost sheep come dragging into the fold—the beaten, broken, dirty sheep who stands at the door looking up at the Shepherd and asking, “Can I come in?” The Shepherd looks down at the sheep and says, “Come in. This is your home.”\nJesus has given you salvation. No one can take it away from you. But sanctification—being made holy—will happen your whole life.\nSanctification is being changed to be just a little bit more holy, just a little bit more like Jesus each day. It is putting away the old sinfulness and taking on the new holiness.\nThe psalmist David told us that those who have been redeemed—who have been saved—will say so! If we’re not saying so, maybe it’s because we’ve forgotten what it is like to be saved. Let’s tell the world how we are saved! ',
