    "body": 'od fascinates me with His Word. I read and read, yet it is all something so new, remarkable, and blessed. I realize the G truth of that saying, "The bride rejoices to hear the Bridegroom‘s voice." (See John 3:29.) The Word is His voice, and as we get nearer to Jesus, we understand that He came to take out for Himself a people who would be His bride. It means not only to be saved, but also that there is an eternal destiny awaiting us in glory. God in His mercy has given us this blessed revelation of how He lived, loved, and had power to say to those disciples, "Some of you shall not see death until you see the kingdom of God coming in power." (See Mark 9:1.)\n\nOh, that blessed Christ, who could pray until His countenance was changed and became so glorious, until His raiment became white and glistening. He said, “I have power to lay [My life]  down, and I have power to take it again”  (John 10:18). It is true that by wicked hands He was taken and crucified, but He had to be willing, for He had all power and could have called on legions of angels to deliver Him from death. But oh, that blessed Christ had purposed to save us and bring us into fellowship and oneness with Himself. He went right through death so that He might impart to us the blessed reconciliation between God and man.\n\nSo it is that the Man Jesus Christ, who is the Atonement for the whole world, who is the Son of God, is also the sinner‘s Friend. “He was wounded for our transgressions”  (Isa. 53:5). This blessed Christ gave His disciples the glory that He had with the Father before the world was. (See John 17:5.) God wants us to know that He will withhold “no good thing…from those who walk uprightly”  (Ps. 84:11), including health, peace, joy in the Holy Spirit, and a life in Christ Jesus.',
