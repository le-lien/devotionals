    "body": 'If you welcome Jesus as your Savior, he promises you a new birth. “No one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again” (John 3:3 NIV).\nDoes that mean your old nature will never reappear? Does that mean you will instantly be able to resist any temptation?\nTo answer that question, compare your new birth in Christ to a newborn baby. Can a newborn walk? Can he feed himself? Can he sing or read or speak? No, not yet. But someday he will.\nIt takes time to grow. But is the parent in the delivery room ashamed of the baby? Is the mom embarrassed that the infant can’t spell … that the baby can’t walk … that the newborn can’t give a speech?\nOf course not. The parents aren’t ashamed; they are proud. They know that growth will come with time. So does God. ',
