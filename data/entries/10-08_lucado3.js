    "body": 'One morning on the side of a Swiss mountain, a man watched two goats headed down a narrow path from opposite directions, one going up, the other down. At one point the narrow trail prevented them from passing each other. When they saw each other, they backed up and lowered their heads, as though ready to lunge. But then a wonderful thing happened. The ascending goat lay down on the path. The other stepped over his back. The first animal then arose and continued his climb to the top. The man observed that the first goat made it higher because he was willing to bend lower.\nWhat works for goats also works for people. When we’re willing to bend low and allow others to get their way, it’s usually true that both sides get what they want. It’s a form of humility. “Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves” (Philippians 2:3\nNIV).\nOur model, as always, is Jesus, who “humbled himself by becoming obedient to death—even death on a cross!” (v. 8 NIV). ',

      "text": 'You can show humility in the simplest of ways, such as when you and another person reach the cafeteria line at the same time, and you say, “You go ahead.” You know it’s taking root in your life when you pray, Please, God, you lead the way, and I’ll follow you.'
