    "body": 'Early Christians were urged to “pray without ceasing” (1 Thessalonians 5:17 NASB); “keep on praying” (Romans 12:12 NLT); and “pray … at all times and on every occasion” (Ephesians 6:18 NLT).\nSound like an impossible assignment? Are you wondering, My homework needs to get done, my parents expect me to do chores, my coach needs me to practice. How can I sit around praying all day?\nDo this: change your definition of prayer. Think of prayers less as an activity for God and more as an awareness of God. Seek to live in uninterrupted awareness. Acknowledge his presence everywhere you go. As you stand in line to get on the bus, think, Thanks, God, for being with me through my day. In the mall as you shop, Lord, you love each and every one of these people, including me. Thank you. As you put away the dishes, worship your Maker. Prayer isn’t a task to check off your list. Prayer is an ongoing conversation with God.\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
