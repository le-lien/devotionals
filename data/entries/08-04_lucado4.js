    "body": 'Have you ever seen the way a groom looks at his bride during the wedding? I have. Perhaps it’s because of where I’m standing. As the minister at the wedding, I’m standing right next to the groom.\nIf the light is just right, I can see a tiny reflection in his eyes. Her reflection. And the sight of her reminds him why he is here. His jaw softens, and his smile becomes real again. He forgets he’s wearing a tux. He forgets his sweat-soaked shirt. When he sees her, any thought of running away becomes a joke. For it’s written all over his face, “I can’t live without my bride!”\nAnd those are the exact same feelings Jesus has. Look long enough into His eyes, and you will see the reflection of someone. Dressed in white.\nClothed in pure grace.\nAnd who is this person Jesus is waiting for? It’s you!  You are the joy of God’s heart. ',
