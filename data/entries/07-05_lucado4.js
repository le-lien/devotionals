    "body": 'Bitterness is hurt and anger that you hold on to. It is that wish for revenge against those who have wronged you. And it is its own prison.\nThe walls of this prison are slippery with hatred. Puddles of muddy anger darken the floor. The stench of betrayal fills the air and stings the eyes. And a cloud of self-pity blocks out the light.\nBitterness can trap you when you’ve been lied to, betrayed by friends, or bullied by enemies. It will trap you when you choose to hold on to the hurt.\nWhen you choose not to forgive. When you choose to hate. Bitterness will trap your heart in a prison just as real as one with iron bars.\nBut you can escape from that prison. How? Choose to let go of the hurt.\nChoose to forgive. Choose to accept God’s love and grace, and then give it to others. ',
