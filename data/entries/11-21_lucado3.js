    "body": 'Paul’s question echoes through the centuries: “If God is for us, who can be against us?” The question is not simply, “Who can be against us?” You could answer that one. Who is against you? Disease, disasters, people, pimples. Homework hassles and worries that wear on you. A crisis around every corner. Were Paul’s question, “Who can be against us?” we could list our enemies much easier than we could fight them. But that is not the question. The question is, IfGod is for us, who can be against us?\nGod is for you. Your parents may have forgotten you, your teachers may have neglected you, your siblings may be ashamed of you; but within reach of your prayers is the maker of the oceans—God!\nNo matter how bad your life gets, you have someone on your side who can take out your toughest opponent. Even on the most horrible day, that’s a reason for hope. ',
