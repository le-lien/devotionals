    "body": 'See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on Christ. For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form, and you have been given fullness in Christ.\n(Colossians 2:8–10 niv)\nThat is my aim—to enter into the fullness that has been given to us in Jesus Christ, who is to be our ultimate goal and satisfaction. We can illustrate this with a parallel to the tabernacle of Moses, as described in the Old Testament. Its structure was in three sections: first, the Outer Court; then, inside the first curtain, the Holy Place; and inside the second curtain, the Holy of Holies. Again, one simple way to distinguish between these is by the light available in each section.\nIn the Outer Court, the light is natural, provided by the sun, moon, and stars. In the Holy Place, there is no natural light. The light is provided by the seven-branched candlestick, where oil is ignited in the bowls to provide light. Once inside the Holy Place, you are no longer living by your senses, but by faith. Remarkably, beyond the second curtain, there was no light at all. There was only one reason to enter: to meet with God. When a man with a true heart went in beyond that second veil, it became gloriously illuminated with the supernatural presence of God, called the shekinah. That is the ultimate goal. There is nothing to entice us beyond that second veil except God. He provides no alternative attractions—it is God or nothing. If God does not come, you are left in total darkness. Living with God as our goal means pursuing no alternative attractions. It is God Himself, God alone. The light that I seek is neither natural nor artificial; it is supernatural—the presence of God Himself.\nThank You, Lord, for Your work in me. I proclaim that it is God Himself and God alone whom I seek—the fullness of Christ—for I have been made perfect in Christ. Amen. ',
