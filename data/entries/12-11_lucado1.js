Don’t attend a lecture on prayer or engage in discussion about prayer. Just pray.\nPosture, tone, and place are personal matters. Select the form that works for you. But don’t think about it too much. Don’t be so concerned about wrapping the gift that you never give it. Better to pray awkwardly than not at all.\nAnd if you feel you should only pray when inspired, that’s okay. Just see to it that you are inspired every day. ',
