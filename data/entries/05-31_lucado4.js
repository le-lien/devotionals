    "body": 'Antonio Stradivari was a violin maker in the 1700s. His name in its Latin form, Stradivarius, has come to mean “excellence.” He once said that to make a violin less than his best would be to rob God, who could not make Antonio Stradivari’s violins without Antonio.\nHe was right. God could not make Stradivarius violins without Antonio Stradivari. Certain gifts were given to that craftsman that no other violin maker possessed.\nIn the same way, there are certain things you can do that no one else can.\nPerhaps it is encouraging your friends, playing basketball, or drawing the beauty of God’s creation. There are things that only you  can do, and you were put here by God to do them. Pretend that life is a great orchestra and you have been given an instrument and a song. You owe it to God to play them both the very best that you can. ',
