    "body": 'This is no run-of-the-mill messiah. His story was extraordinary. He called himself divine, yet allowed a minimum-wage Roman soldier to drive a nail into his wrist. He demanded purity, yet stood for the rights of a repentant whore. He called men to march, yet refused to allow them to call him King.\nHe sent men into all the world, yet equipped them with only bended knees and memories of a resurrected carpenter.\nHas it been a while since you have seen him? If your prayers seem stale, it probably has. If your faith seems to be trembling, perhaps your vision of him has blurred. If you can’t find power to face your problems, perhaps it is time to face him.\nOne warning. Something happens to a person who has witnessed His Majesty… . One glimpse of the King and you are consumed by a desire to see more of him and say more about him. ',
