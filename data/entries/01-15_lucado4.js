If you find yourself doing this, stop and just look at all the gifts God has given you:\n• God sent His angels to take care of you, His Holy Spirit to live inside you, His church to help you, and His Word to guide you.\n• Every time you speak, He listens. Every time you pray, He answers.\n• He will give you the strength to do the right thing even when it is hard.\n• He will always be there to comfort you and help wipe away your tears.\n• He always wants to see you.\nBut the very best gift of all? You have been chosen by Christ. You are a beloved child of God! ',
