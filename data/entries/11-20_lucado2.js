    "body": 'Doubt. He’s a nosy neighbor. He’s an unwanted visitor. He’s an obnoxious guest.\nHe’ll pester you. He’ll irritate you. He’ll criticize your judgment. He’ll kick the stool out from under you and refuse to help you up. He’ll tell you not to believe in the invisible yet offer no answer for the inadequacy of the visible… . His aim is not to convince you but to confuse you. He doesn’t offer solutions, he only raises questions.\nHad any visits from this fellow lately? If you find yourself going to church in order to be saved and not because you are saved, then you’ve been listening to him. If you find yourself doubting God could forgive you again for that, you’ve been sold some snake oil. If you are more cynical about Christians than sincere about Christ, then guess who came to dinner?\nI suggest you put a lock on your gate. I suggest you post a “Do Not Enter” sign on your door. ',
