Some thoughts grow into flowers. Others grow into weeds. If you plant seeds of hope, you will grow love and joy. But if you plant seeds of fear and anger, you will grow worry, jealousy, and even hate.\nThe proof is everywhere you look. Ever wonder how some people seem to see the good in everything and everyone? Nothing bad ever sticks to them. They are always so patient, so cheerful, so forgiving. Could it be that they carefully planted seeds of hope in their hearts, and now they are enjoying the harvest of goodness? ',
