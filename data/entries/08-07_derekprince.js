    "body": 'There is no other way to God the Father but through Jesus Christ—\nand Him crucified. We have access to God through Jesus alone and by only one Spirit. There is only one Spirit who gives humans access to God the Father—the Holy Spirit. He operates only through the Lord Jesus Christ. If you come by any door other than Jesus, or if you come through any other spirit, you do not have access to God; you have access to the realm of Satan. Instead of going into the realm of light, you will go into the realm of darkness.\nRemember, Satan transforms himself into an angel of light, and his ministers transform themselves as ministers of righteousness. (See 2 Corinthians 11:14–15.) They often use beautiful, sweet, loving words and long, eloquent phrases—even quoting Scripture—in order to get you into the realm of darkness. They do this under the guise of being angels of light. If you do not come by Jesus Christ crucified on the cross, and if you do not come by the Holy Spirit of God, you can get into the occult, supernatural realm. I have been there, and I know what it is like.\nBefore I found Jesus, I was a practicing Yogi. There was a time when I got out of the natural, but what I got into scared me, even then. I didn’t like it. I decided that once was enough.\nSome years later, when I was confronted with the gospel and the power of the Holy Spirit, the great barrier between me and Christ was Yoga. I could not break through that mental barrier. God had to perform a miracle of deliverance. I didn’t know about demons, but I wanted to come to Jesus. I could not reach Him until that Yoga demon had lost its power over my mind. You can theorize, but I know what it is like. It is one of a thousand different ways of being deceived into the territory of Satan and becoming enslaved. ',
