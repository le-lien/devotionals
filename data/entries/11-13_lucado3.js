    "body": 'Antonio Stradivari was a seventeenth-century violin maker whose name in its Latin form, Stradivarius, is now linked with excellence. He once said that to make a violin less than his best would be to rob God, who could not make Antonio Stradivari’s violins without Antonio.\nHe was right. God could not make Stradivarius violins without Antonio Stradivari. Certain gifts were given to that craftsman that no other violin maker possessed.\nThere are also certain things you can do that no one else can. Maybe you’re a computer whiz. Maybe you paint. Perhaps you work well with animals or small children or you’re really good at encouraging the discouraged. It’s very possible you haven’t yet discovered your greatest gifts.\nBut there are things that only you can do, and you are alive to do them. In the great orchestra we call life, you have an instrument and a song, and you owe it to God to play them both with your very best. ',
