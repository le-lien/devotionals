    "body": 'Chances are you’ve given very little thought to a home for your soul.\nYou probably have a nice, warm house for your body to live in.\nMaybe even your own room. But have you thought about your soul’s house? Is your soul warm and safe with God? Or is it left out in the world, where the night winds blow and the rain soaks it through? A soul left out in the world soon becomes cold.\nIt doesn’t have to be this way. Our souls don’t have to live out in the wet and cold. It’s not God’s plan for your soul to wander around in the world.\nGod wants you to move out of the cold and move in … with Him. Under His roof, there is plenty of room. At His table, a plate is already set for you.\nIn His living room, a cozy chair is waiting just for you. And He’d like you to live in His house. Why would He want to share His home with you? ',

Things like heaters and air conditioners, couches and beds, blankets and pillows. You do all this for your earthly body, which is only temporary. But what are you doing for your eternal soul?'
