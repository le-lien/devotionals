    "body": 'David runs toward the army to meet Goliath (1 Samuel 17:48). Goliath throws back his head in laughter, just enough to shift his helmet and expose a square inch of flesh. David spots the target and seizes the moment.\nHis sling swirls. The stone torpedoes through the air and into the skull; Goliath crumples to the ground and dies. David yanks Goliath’s sword from its sheath, shish-kebabs the Philistine, and cuts off his head.\nYou might say that David knew how to get a head of his giant.\nWhen was the last time you did the same? How long since you ran toward your challenge? We tend to retreat, ducking behind a pile of homework or slipping into the distraction of party life. For a time we feel safe, comfortable, but then the work runs out or the parties end, and we hear Goliath again.\nBooming. Bombastic.\nTry a different tack. Rush your giant with a God-soaked soul. Giant of depression? You won’t conquer me. Giant of alcohol, drugs, insecurity . . .\nyou’re going down. How long since you loaded your sling and took a swing at your giant? ',
