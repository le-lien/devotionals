Jesus is praying in the garden only hours before His death. Jesus is in pain. Jesus is filled with fear. At this moment, perhaps more than any other, Jesus knows how weak and frail His human body is.\nThe next time you are really sad, remember Jesus in the garden. The next time you think no one understands how much you are hurting, read this verse again. The next time you are feeling sorry for yourself, kneel down just as Jesus did in the garden. And the next time you wonder if God really understands how hard it is to live on this earth, think of Jesus’ pleading prayer in the garden.\nGrowing in Grace ',
