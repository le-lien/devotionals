    "body": 'We often celebrate our independence as individuals and as a nation, but independence in our faith means no faith at all. Following Jesus means depending on him.\nAs long as you can carry your burdens alone, you don’t need a burden bearer. As long as your situation brings you no grief, you will receive no comfort. And as long as you can take him or leave him, you might as well leave him, because he won’t be taken half-heartedly. When Jesus is one of many options, he is no option.\nBut when you are full of sadness and sorrow over your mistakes, when you admit that you have no other choice but to give all your problems to him, and when there is truly no other name that you can call, then go ahead. Tell him all your troubles. Give all your problems to him. He is waiting in the middle of the storm with the answers you need. You can—you must—depend on him. ',
