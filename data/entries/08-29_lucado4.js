(We may need name tags.)\nWill we be walking through walls and on water? Chances are we’ll be doing much more than that.\nWill we still have the scars from this life? The bumps and bruises. The signs of disease. The jagged scars of bike wrecks and broken arms. Will these still be on our bodies? That’s a good question. Jesus kept the wounds on His hands, His feet, and His side for at least forty days. Will we keep ours? For this question, we have only opinions, and my opinion is no. Peter told us “we are healed because of his wounds” (1 Peter 2:24). In heaven, only one wound is worthy of being remembered—the wound of Jesus. ',

As you go back to school this year, be careful not to hurt those around you. And when you see someone who is hurt by bullying, offer him or her healing words of kindness.'
