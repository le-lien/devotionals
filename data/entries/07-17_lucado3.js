    "body": 'Two types of thoughts continually compete for your attention. One says,\n“Yes, you can.” The other says, “No, you can’t.” One says, “God will help you.” The other lies, “God has left you.” One proclaims God’s strengths; the other lists your failures. One tries to build you up; the other seeks to tear you down.\nAnd here’s the great news: you select the voice you hear. Why listen to the mockers? Why heed their voices? Why give ear to pea brains and hecklers when you can, with the same ear, listen to the voice of God?\nA young woman fights her anxiety by memorizing long sections of Scripture. A young man unplugs the Internet after checking his e-mail so he won’t be tempted by pornography. A student tires of her negative, gossiping friends and starts eating lunch with classmates she barely knows.\nTurn a deaf ear to the old voices. Open a wide eye to the new choices. ',
