Why does He teach us to pray,\n“Forgive the sins we have done” (Matthew 6:12)?\nFor the very same reason your parents and teacher make you say you are sorry when you do something wrong. If my own children break a rule, I don’t kick them out of the house or tell them to change their last name. But I do want them to be honest about what they did and to apologize. And until they do, our relationship will suffer. I will still be their dad, and they will still be my children, but we will not be as close. There will be a wall between us. ',
