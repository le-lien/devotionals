This is happening all the time, and I do thank God for it because it is teaching me how to minister to people in the Lord.\n\nMessages came to me again and again by telegraph, letters, and other things, asking that I come to London. I wired back and wrote, but so many calls came and no hint was given in any way as to the reason I was to go there. The only thing they said was that they were in great distress.\n\nWhen I got there, the dear father and mother of the needy one both took me by the hand and broke down and wept.\n\n"Surely this is deep sorrow of heart," I said.\n\nThey led me up onto the balcony. Then they pointed to a door that was open a little, and both of them left me. I went in that door and I have never seen a sight like it in all my life. I saw a young woman who was beautiful to look at, but she had four big men holding her down to the floor, and her clothing was torn from the struggle.\n\nWhen I got into the room and looked into her eyes, her eyes rolled but she could not speak. She was exactly like the man in the Bible who came out of the tombs and ran to Jesus when he saw Him. As soon as he got to Jesus, he couldn‘t speak, but the demon powers spoke. (See Mark 5:1–13.) And the demon powers in this young girl spoke and said, "I know you. You can‘t cast us out; we are many."\n\n"Yes," I said, "I know you are many, but my Lord Jesus will cast you all out."\n\nIt was a wonderful moment; it was a moment when it was only He alone who could do it.\n\nThe power of Satan was so great upon this beautiful girl that she whirled and broke away from these four strong men.\n\nThe Spirit of the Lord was wonderful in me, and I went right up to her and looked into her face. I saw the evil powers there; her very eyes flashed with demon power.\n\n"In the name of Jesus," I said, "I command you to leave. Though you are many, I command you to leave this moment, in the name of Jesus."\n\nShe instantly became sick and began vomiting. She vomited out thirty-seven evil spirits and gave their names as they came out. That day she was made as perfect as anybody. Praise the Lord!',
