There is never a room so dark that your greatest Friend is not around. He is always present, always seeking, always tender. It’s as if He is gently tapping on the door of your heart—just waiting to be invited in.\nNot many people hear His voice. Even fewer people open the door of their hearts to Him.\nBut that doesn’t mean He isn’t there. Because He is. He promised He always would be: “You can be sure that I will be with you always. I will continue with you until the end of the world” (Matthew 28:20).\nSome people in this world may tell you to stop listening to Jesus. They may tell you that the things He says are wrong aren’t really wrong. Don’t listen to them. Open up your Bible and listen for Jesus’ voice. His Word will speak to you … if you will listen. ',

We usually don’t see the air, but the cold lets us see it. And just like the air, God is everywhere—even though we don’t see Him.'
