    "body": 'One of the reference points of London is the Charing Cross. It is near the geographical center of the city and serves as a navigational tool for those confused by the streets.\nA little girl was lost in the great city. A policeman found her. Between sobs and tears, she explained she didn’t know her way home. He asked her if she knew her address. She didn’t. He asked her phone number; she didn’t know that either. But when he asked her what she knew, suddenly her face lit up.\n“I know the Cross,” she said. “Show me the Cross and I can find my way home from there.”\nSo can you. Keep a clear vision of the cross on your horizon and you can find your way home. ',
