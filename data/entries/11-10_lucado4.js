    "body": 'If you have every wondered how God feels when you mess up, when you sin, frame the words of John 8:11 and hang them on your wall. Read them. Think about them. Remember them.\nOr, better still, drop down on your knees. Ask God to come and hear your prayers as you tell Him about the mistake that you made, the wrong thing that you did. Tell Him how sorry you are and how ashamed.\nAnd then listen. Listen very carefully. He’s saying, “I don’t judge you.”\nHear His grace and forgiveness in the words of John 3:17–18, “God did not send his Son into the world to judge the world guilty, but to save the world through him. He who believes in God’s Son is not judged guilty.”\nThat is God’s message to you—you are not guilty. ',
