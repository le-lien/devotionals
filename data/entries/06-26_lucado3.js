    "body": 'One of my Boy Scout assignments was to build a kite. One of my blessings as a Boy Scout was a kite-building dad. We fashioned a sky-dancing masterpiece: red, white, and blue and shaped like a box. We launched our creation on the back of a March wind. But after some minutes, my kite caught a downdraft and plunged. I did all I could to maintain elevation. But it was too late.\nEnvision a redheaded, heartsick twelve-year-old standing over his collapsed kite. Envision a square-bodied man with ruddy skin placing his hand on the boy’s shoulder. My dad surveyed the heap of sticks and paper and assured, “It’s okay. We can fix this.” I believed him. Why not? He spoke with authority.\nSo does Christ. To all whose lives feel like a crashed kite, he says, “It’s okay. We can fix this.” Your world may look like a pile of worthless sticks.\nTake heart. The hand of Jesus is on your shoulder. You are blessed with a life-building Savior. ',
