Spend a few moments looking again at the pieces of passion.\nRun your thumb over the tip of the spear. Balance a spike in the palm of your hand. Read the wooden sign written in your own language. And as you do, touch the velvet dirt, moist with the blood of God.\nBlood he bled for you.\nThe spear he took for you.\nThe nails he felt for you.\nThe sign he left for you.\nHe did all of this for you. Knowing this, knowing all he did for you there, don’t you think he’ll look out for you here? ',
