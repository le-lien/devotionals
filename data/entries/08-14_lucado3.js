    "body": 'The Climb\nYou and I are on a great climb. The wall is high, and the stakes are higher.\nYou took your first step the day you accepted Christ as the Son of God.\nHe gave you his harness—the Holy Spirit. In your hands he placed a rope—\nhis Word.\nYour first steps were confident and strong, but with the journey came weariness, and with the height came fear. You lost your footing. You lost your focus. You lost your grip, and you fell. For a moment, which seemed like forever, you tumbled wildly. Out of control. Out of self-control. Disoriented.\nDislodged. Falling.\nBut then the rope tightened, and the tumble stopped. You hung in the harness and found it to be strong. You grasped the rope and found it to be reliable. And though you can’t see your guide, you know him. You know he is strong. You know he is able to keep you from falling.\nAnd so you climb once more. ',

      "text": 'Our faith journey often feels like climbing a mountain. The thrill of starting out. The amazement at the discoveries along the way. The fatigue. The worries. The slips and falls. The excitement as we near our goal. And when we finally reach the mountaintop? There’s no joy that compares.'
