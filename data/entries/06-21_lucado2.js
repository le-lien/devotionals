    "body": 'A transformed group stood beside a transformed Peter as he announced:\n“Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.”\nNo timidity in his words. No reluctance. About three thousand people believed his message.\nThe apostles sparked a movement. The people became followers of the death-conqueror. They couldn’t hear enough or say enough about him.\nPeople began to call them “Christ-ians.” Christ was their model, their message. They preached “Jesus Christ and him crucified,” not for the lack of another topic, but because they couldn’t exhaust this one.\nWhat unlocked the doors of the apostles’ hearts?\nSimple. They saw Jesus. They encountered the Christ. Their sins collided with their Savior and their Savior won! ',
