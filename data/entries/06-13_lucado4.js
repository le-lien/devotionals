Well, even though you’re a long way from being a bride or a groom, you’ve seen brides, haven’t you? Is there anything more beautiful than a bride?\nMaybe it is her beautiful dress or the way her eyes sparkle like diamonds.\nOr maybe it’s the blush of love that colors her cheeks or the flowers that she carries in her arms.\nA bride. She is like a beautiful promise, saying to her groom, “I’ll be with you forever.” ',
