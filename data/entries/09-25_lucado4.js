So it makes sense that your heavenly Father would have a name for you.\nAnd isn’t it incredible to think that God has saved a name just for you?\nOne you don’t even know? We’ve always thought that the name we got when we were born is the name we will keep. Not so. The road ahead is so bright that a fresh, new name is needed. Your eternity is so special that no ordinary name will do.\nGod has one picked out just for you. There is more to your life than you ever thought. There is more to your story than what you have read.\nAnd so I beg you … be there when God whispers your name. ',
