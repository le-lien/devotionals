Take a look at his creation. Curious about his strength? Pay a visit to his home address: 1 Billion Starry Sky Avenue.\nOur atmosphere of sin can’t reach him. The timeline of history can’t contain him. The weariness of our bodies has no effect on him.\nWhat controls you doesn’t control him. What troubles you doesn’t trouble him. What fatigues you doesn’t fatigue him. Is an eagle disturbed by traffic?\nNo, he rises above it. Is the whale perturbed by a hurricane? Of course not, he plunges beneath it. Is the lion flustered by the mouse standing directly in his way? No, he steps over it. How much more is God able to soar above, plunge beneath, and step over the troubles of the earth!\nThink he can handle our puny problems? Of course he can. He’s God.\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
