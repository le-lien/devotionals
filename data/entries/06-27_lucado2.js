    "body": 'What do we do with our disappointments? We could do what Miss Haversham did. Remember her in Charles Dickens’s Great Expectations ?\nJilted by her fiancé just prior to the wedding, … she closed all the blinds in the house, stopped every clock, left the wedding cake on the table to gather cobwebs, and wore her wedding dress until it hung in yellow decay around her shrunken form. Her wounded heart consumed her life.\nWe can follow the same course.\nOr we can follow the example of the apostle Paul. His goal was to be a missionary in Spain, . . . however, God sent him to prison. Sitting in a Roman jail, Paul could have made the same choice as Miss Haversham, but he didn’t. Instead he said, “As long as I’m here, I might as well write a few letters.” Hence your Bible has the Epistles to Philemon, the Philippians, the Colossians, and the Ephesians. ',
