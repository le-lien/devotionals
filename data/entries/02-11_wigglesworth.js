    "body": 'was taken to see a beautiful nine-year-old boy who was lying on a bed. The mother and father were distraught because he I had been lying there for months. They had to lift and feed him; he was like a statue with flashing eyes. As soon as I entered the place, the Lord revealed to me the cause of the trouble, so I said to the mother, "The Lord shows me there is something wrong with his stomach."\n\nShe said, "Oh no, we have had two physicians, and they say it is paralysis of the mind."\n\nI said, "God reveals to me it is his stomach."\n\n"Oh, no, it isn‘t. These physicians ought to know, they have X-rayed him."\n\nThe gentleman who brought me there said to the mother, "You have sent for this man; you have been the means of his coming; now don‘t you stand out against him. This man knows what he has got to do."\n\nBut Dr. Jesus knows more than that. He knows everything. All you have to do is call for Jesus, and He will come. Divine things are so much better than human things. Who will interfere with the divine mind of the Spirit that has all revelation, that understands the whole condition of life? The Word of God declares He knows all things (1 John 3:20) and is well acquainted with the manifestation of our bodies, for everything is naked and open before Him to whom we must give account (Heb. 4:13). Having the mind of the Spirit, we understand what the will of God is. I prayed over this boy and laid my hands on his stomach. He became sick, vomited a worm thirteen inches long, and was perfectly restored.',
