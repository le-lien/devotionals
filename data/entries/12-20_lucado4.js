He gives it to us as a gift. That’s right. A gift. Salvation—being with God in heaven forever—is His gift to us. For “every perfect gift is from God.” And salvation is God’s greatest, most perfect gift of all. We just have to accept it.\nWrite this down and remember it: Salvation is given by God, powered by God, and created by God. It’s not something that we can earn. It’s not something that God owes us because of the good things we have done.\nSalvation is God’s gift to us. ',
