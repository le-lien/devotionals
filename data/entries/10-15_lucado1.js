    "body": 'Don’t think you are separated from God, he at the top end of a great ladder, you at the other. Dismiss any thought that God is on Venus while you are on earth. Since God is Spirit (John 4:23), he is next to you: God himself is our roof. God himself is our wall. And God himself is our foundation.\nMoses knew this. “LORD,” he prayed, “you have been our home since the beginning” (Ps. 90:l). What a powerful thought: God as your home.\nYour home is the place where you can kick off your shoes and eat pickles and crackers and not worry about what people think when they see you in your bathrobe.\nYour home is familiar to you. No one has to tell you how to locate your bedroom… . God can be equally familiar to you. With time you can learn where to go for nourishment, where to hide for protection, where to turn for guidance. Just as your earthly house is a place of refuge, so God’s house is a place of peace. God’s house has never been plundered, his walls have never been breached. ',
