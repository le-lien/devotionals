    "body": 'We can replace the word forgiven with accepted and maintain the integrity of the passage. “He who is accepted little loves little.” If we think God is harsh and unfair, guess how we’ll treat people. Harshly and unfairly.\nBut if we discover that God has doused us with unconditional love, would that make a difference?\nThe apostle Paul would say so! Talk about a turnaround. He went from bully to teddy bear. Paul B.C. (Before Christ) sizzled with anger. He “made havoc of the church” (Acts 8:3 NKJV). Paul A.D. (After Discovery) brimmed with love… .\nHis accusers beat him, stoned him, jailed him, mocked him. But can you find one occasion where he responded in kind? One temper tantrum? One angry outburst? This is a different man.  His anger is gone. His passion is strong. His devotion is unquestioned. But rash outbursts of anger? A thing of the past.\nWhat made the difference? He encountered Christ.
