    "body": 'Have you ever noticed the way a groom looks at his bride during the wedding? I have. Perhaps it’s my vantage point. As the minister of the wedding, I’m positioned next to the groom… .\nIf the light is just so and the angle just right, I can see a tiny reflection in his eyes. Her reflection. And the sight of her reminds him why he is here.\nHis jaw relaxes and his forced smile softens. He forgets he’s wearing a tux.\nHe forgets his sweat-soaked shirt. . . .When he sees her, any thought of escape becomes a joke again. For it’s written all over his face, “Who could bear to live without this bride?”\nAnd such are precisely the feelings of Jesus. Look long enough into the eyes of our Savior and, there, too, you will see a bride. Dressed in fine linen. Clothed in pure grace… . She is the bride … walking toward him…\n.\nAnd who is this bride for whom Jesus longs? . . . You are. You have captured the heart of God. ',
