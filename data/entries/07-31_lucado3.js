    "body": 'The Internet is a great tool, but it comes with hidden dangers. Pornography is one of them.\nThe For many, many guys, this is a big deal. They figure a few glances won’t hurt anybody. They think they can stop when they want. For those who can, unwanted images still imprint on the mind. For those who cannot, an addiction is born.\nYou can’t play with fire and not get burned. So don’t light the match. The Bible never says to battle sexual sin, struggle against sexual sin . . . no, our call is to “run away from sexual sin” (1 Corinthians 6:18 NCV). Just because a girl dresses to get your attention, you don’t have to look. Just because pictures appear, you don’t have to view them. Cover your eyes and guard your thoughts! You will live tomorrow the thoughts you tolerate today. Use this to your advantage. Want great relationships tomorrow? Think about the strengths of your friendships today. Want to enjoy more faith tomorrow?\nMeditate on God’s Word today. You are what you think.\nONE MORE THOUGHT\nGuys are visual. That’s how God made us. So gals, help us out here by choosing reserved over racy in your wardrobe. And guys, if you’re having a problem with pornography, tell somebody who can help you deal with it. The longer you wait, the harder it is to escape.\nAUGUST\nAnd not only that, but we also glory in\ntribulations, knowing that tribulation\nproduces perseverance; and perseverance, ',
