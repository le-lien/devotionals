    "body": 'God wants to spend time with us so that He can change our face. And He wants to change our face so that it shows His glory. But the change isn’t easy. The sculptor who carved the presidents’ faces into Mount Rushmore had an easier job than God does. But our God is able to do it.\nGod loves to change the faces of His children. His fingers rub away the wrinkles of worry and fear. Shadows of shame become smiles of grace. He softens clenched jaws and gritted teeth. He smoothes away lines of anger.\nHis touch gives rest to weary eyes, and tears of sadness become tears of peace and relief.\nHow does God do that? Through worship and praise.\nYou’d think it would be harder, wouldn’t you? Maybe spending forty days without food like Moses did and Jesus did. Or memorizing the entire book of Leviticus. But no. God’s plan is simpler. When we praise Him and worship Him, He changes our faces and fills them with joy. ',
