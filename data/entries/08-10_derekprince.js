    "body": 'Jesus said, “I am the way, the truth, and the life” (John 14:6). We often quote that Scripture; it is a favorite evangelistic text. However, we rarely stop to consider its full implication. A way  is meaningless unless it takes us somewhere. A way is not an end in itself. So, when Jesus said, “I am the way,”  He was implying that He had come to take us somewhere.\nWhere is He taking us? He explained, “No one comes to the Father except through Me” (verse 6). In other words, He was saying, “I am the way to the Father. I am the revelation of the Father. If you have seen Me, you have seen the Father.” (See verses 7–9.)\nAnd He [Jesus]  came and preached peace to you who were afar off [the Gentiles] and to those who were near [the Jews] . For through Him we both [Jew and Gentile]  have access by one Spirit to the Father.\n(Ephesians 2:17–18)\nAgain, all three persons of the Godhead are included in that one verse: through the Son, by the Spirit, to the Father. But the Father is the destination. The verse is meaningless if you leave out the Father.\nThe ultimate objective is to reveal the Father and to bring us to Him.\nIf we stop short of the fulfillment of that objective, we have missed the purpose for which Jesus came.\nFor Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for the unjust, in order that He might bring us to God.\n(1 Peter 3:18 nasb)\nWhy did Jesus die? That our sins might be forgiven, yes. But that was only one stage in the process. The ultimate purpose was that He might bring us to God. ',
