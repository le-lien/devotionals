Only a heartless god would sell salvation to the highest bidders.\nAnd only a great God would do for His children what they can’t do for themselves—save them. God gives you His joy when you give yourself up to Him, not when He defeats you. The first step to getting His joy is to ask for His help, to admit that you have sinned, to realize that you aren’t good enough for heaven.\nThose who choose to follow God understand that they can’t get to heaven without His help. Those who choose to follow God ask for His forgiveness for all the wrongs they have done. ',
