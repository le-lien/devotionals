    "body": 'Jesus tends to his sheep. And he will tend to you.\nIf you will let him. How? How do you let him? The steps are so simple.\nFirst, go to him. David would trust his wounds to no other person but God. He said, “You anoint my head with oil” (Ps. 23:5 NKJV). Not, “your prophets,” “your teachers,” or “your counselors.”\nYour second step is to assume the right posture. Bow before God.\nIn order to be anointed, the sheep must stand still, lower their heads, and let the shepherd do his work. Peter urges us to “be humble under God’s powerful hand so he will lift you up when the right time comes” (1 Pet.\n5:6).\nWhen we come to God, we make requests; we don’t make demands. We come with high hopes and a humble heart. We state what we want, but we pray for what is right.\nWe go to him. We bow before him, and we trust in him. ',
