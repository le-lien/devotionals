Think about your own parents and all that they do for you: When your feelings are hurt, do they tell you how amazing you really are? When you’ve been hurt, do they do whatever it takes to make you feel better? When you are afraid, do they wait with you until you feel safe?\nThat’s what parents are supposed to do. They help their hurting children.\nBut what if you are away from your parents, maybe at school? Or if your parents aren’t the helping kind?\nThen remember you have a heavenly Father who is always ready to help.\nWhen you are laughed at, hurt, or afraid, He is ready to comfort you. He will hold you until you’re better, help you until you can live with the hurt, and stay with you when you’re afraid of waking up and seeing the dark. ',
