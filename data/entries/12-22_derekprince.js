    "body": 'Isaiah 53 begins with a warning about the danger that this prophetic message, given to Isaiah by God, will be met by many with unbelief: <i>“Who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?” </i>(Isaiah 53:1).\nThe Lord’s Servant, described in earlier verses (see Isaiah 52:13–15) and foretold in this prophecy, is described in the above verse as <i>“the arm of the Lord.”</i>  This phrase denotes God’s power intervening on behalf of His people. It indicated ahead of time that through Jesus Christ Himself, God would intervene to bring salvation to His people. All this was fulfilled in Jesus. He came to reveal God and to bring His salvation and healing to everyone. Peter, an eyewitness of the earthly ministry of Jesus, summed it up: <i>“God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him”</i> (Acts 10:38).\nThe gospel of John applies Isaiah’s prophecy directly to Jesus: But although He had done so many signs [miracles] before them, they did not believe in Him, that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke: <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>“Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”</i>(John 12:37–38)</p>We must hold fast to our belief in Him who fulfilled the Old Testament prophecies. Even many of those who witnessed firsthand the miracles of Jesus were incredulous. Let us not demand signs and wonders, which do not guarantee belief, but let us maintain faith in the One who earned our salvation, the greatest miracle of all.',
