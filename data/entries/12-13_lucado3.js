    "body": 'My college friends and I barely escaped a West Texas storm before it pummeled the park where we were spending a Saturday afternoon. As we were leaving, my buddy brought the car to a sudden stop and pointed to a tender sight on the ground. A mother bird sat exposed to the rain, her wing extended over her baby who had fallen out of the nest. The fierce storm kept her from returning to the tree, so she covered her child until the wind passed.\nFrom how many winds is God protecting you? His wing, at this moment, shields you. A bully heading down the hall in your direction is interrupted by a teacher’s question. A burglar on the way to your house has a flat tire. A drunk driver runs out of gas before your car passes his. “For he will order his angels to protect you wherever you go” (Psalm 91:11 NLT). God, your guardian, protects you. ',
