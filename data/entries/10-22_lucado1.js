You could see God as vividly as you could see a gentle valley or hillside.\nThen, suddenly, the window cracked. A pebble broke the window. A pebble of pain.\nAnd suddenly God was not so easy to see. The view that had been so crisp had changed.\nYou were puzzled. God wouldn’t allow something like this to happen, would he?\nWhen you can’t see him, trust him… . Jesus is closer than you’ve ever dreamed. ',
