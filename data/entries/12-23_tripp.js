This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, “Out of Egypt I called my son.”\nThen Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, became furious, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men. Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah:\n“A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and loud lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children; she refused to be comforted, because they are no more.”</i> (Matt. 2:13–18)</p> The Christmas story is this—that babe in the manger was the Son of the Most High God. He willingly came to a place where such unthinkable violence and injustice exists. The wrath of the ruler would eventually fall on him. He would die a violent death at the hands of evil men. Followers would weep that the Messiah was dead, but he would rise again and complete the work that he came to earth to do.\nAs we sit beneath a beautifully decorated tree and eat the rich food of celebration, we must not let ourselves forget the horror and violence at the beginning and end of the Christmas story. This story begins with a horrible slaughter of children and ends with the violent murder of the Son of God. The slaughter depicts how much the earth needs grace. The murder is the moment when that grace is given.\nLook into that manger and see the One who came to die. Hear the angels’ song and remember that death would be the only way that peace would be given.\nLook at your tree and remember another tree—one not decorated with shining ornaments, but stained with the blood of the Son of God. As you celebrate, remember that the pathway to your celebration was the death of the One you celebrate, and be thankful.',
