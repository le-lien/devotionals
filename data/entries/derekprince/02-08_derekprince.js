The devil’s law is the law of sin and death; the law of God’s kingdom is the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus.  “For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death”  (Romans 8:2).\nWe are no longer in the devil’s territory, no longer under the devil’s law. His kingdom does not apply to us because we are in another kingdom. We have been translated, carried over—spirit, soul, and body. And this transaction occurs through the blood of Jesus—we are sanctified, set apart to God, by the blood of Jesus. ',
