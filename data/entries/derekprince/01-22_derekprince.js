    "body": 'One provision of the precious blood of Jesus is cleansing.\nBut if we walk in the light as He [Jesus]  is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin.\n(1 John 1:7)\nIn this verse, there are three verbs in the continuing present tense: walk, fellowship, and cleanse. We must take note of that. If we continue walking in the light, we continue having fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus continues to cleanse us.\nIt is very important to see that this is conditional. If we continue to walk in the light of God’s Word by obeying what it says, then the first result is that we have fellowship with one another. If we are not walking in the light, we will not have fellowship. And if we do not have fellowship, we are not walking in the light. But, if we walk in the light and have fellowship, then the blood of Jesus continually keeps us clean. ',
