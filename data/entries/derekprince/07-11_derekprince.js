    "body": 'In Matthew 13:45–46, Jesus told a parable that, in my opinion, most beautifully describes the wonder of our redemption: Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls, who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it.\nFor me, this parable depicts the redemption of a human soul. Jesus is the merchant—not a tourist or a sightseer, but a man who has dealt in pearls all His life—and He knows the exact value of every pearl. The pearl that He has purchased is just one human soul—yours or mine. It cost Him all He had, everything He owned.\nUpdated to our contemporary culture, I can picture the scene when that merchant broke the news to his wife.\n“Honey, I’ve sold our car.”\n“You sold our car! Well, at least we still have a roof over our heads.”\n“No, I sold our house, too!”\n“Whatever made you do all that?”\n“I found the most beautiful pearl I’ve ever seen. I’ve been looking all my life for such a pearl. It cost me everything I had. Wait till you see it!”\nWhat does this mean to you and me? Each of us may picture ourselves as that one priceless pearl worth everything Jesus had—even His own blood. ',
