    "body": 'The eleventh “Let us” resolution of Hebrews is in chapter 13: Therefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate. Hence, let us go out to Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach. For here we do not have a lasting city, but we are seeking the city which is to come.\n(Hebrews 13:12–14 nasb)\nThis passage deals with our attitude and relationship to this present world. It is telling us that our home is not in this world. We have no enduring place in this world. The world rejected Jesus. It drove Him out of the city and crucified Him outside the gate.\nThe Scripture always emphasizes the fact that Jesus’ crucifixion took place outside the city wall. Jesus was rejected. He was put out of society; the world did not want Him. And the way in which the world treated Jesus, sooner or later, and in one way or another, is going to be the way in which the world will treat you and me, as believers. We must be willing to go out to Him—to the place of crucifixion, rejection, and shame—bearing His reproach. Elsewhere in Hebrews, it says that the reproach of Christ amounts to greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt. (See Hebrews 11:26.) So, His reproach becomes our glory.\nThen, the writer gave a beautiful reason:  “For here we do not have a lasting city.”  Other people may think that this world is permanent, but we know that it is not. “But we are seeking the city which is to come.”\nI like this translation because it says the city. There is one specific city that is the destination and the home of all true believers. It is where we really belong. ',
