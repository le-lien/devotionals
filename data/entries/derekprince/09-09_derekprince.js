    "body": 'For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith, and pierced themselves with many a pang.\n(1 Timothy 6:10 nasb)\nThe love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Once we allow the love of money into our lives, out of it will come all sorts of evils and temptations and pain. The remedy is to  “seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you”\n(Matthew 6:33). Get your priorities right. God knows we need certain things; it is just a question of priorities.\nLet’s look now at some of the assurances found in the Bible of the presence and provision of the Lord.\nThe word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision, saying,\n“Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward.”\n(Genesis 14:1)\nNo man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life; as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not leave you nor forsake you.\n(Joshua 1:5)\nThe Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want [lack].  (Psalm 23:1) The Lord is for me; I will not fear; what can man do to me?\n(Psalm 118:6 nasb)\nThe Lord is for us. There is no reason to fear. What can man do to us if God is for us? In Romans 8:31, Paul said, “If God is for us, who can be against us?” ',
