    "body": 'Let’s continue to consider God’s purpose for the human body.\nOur physical members are to become slaves, or instruments, of righteousness. First, the Holy Spirit takes up His dwelling place; then, our bodies become His instruments.\nI am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members [physical members]  as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness, resulting in further lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness, resulting in sanctification [holiness] .\n(Romans 6:19 nasb)\nGod’s program for our physical members is for us to present them to Him as slaves, ready to do His will no matter what. Romans 6:13 tells us to present our physical members “as instruments of righteousness.”\nWhen presented to God without reservation, our bodies become sanctified and worthy temples of the Holy Spirit.\nWhen our members are yielded to Him without reservation, as slaves or instruments to do His will, then God says, “All right, since the body is Mine, I’ll accept full responsibility for its maintenance and its well-being, both in this life and in the next.” ',
