    "body": 'I believe that God requires a response from His believing people regarding what He is doing in Israel and the Middle East. We are not permitted to remain neutral, apathetic, or indifferent. God demands a response. In the book of Jeremiah, the prophet told us what the Lord commands us to do:\nSing with joy for Jacob; shout for the foremost [or chief]  of the nations. Make your praises heard, and say, “O Lord, save your people, the remnant of Israel.”\n(Jeremiah 31:7–8 niv)\nThe New American Standard Bible reads, “Proclaim, give praise, and say”  (verse 7). Combining these two versions, I find there are five responses that God requires. In a sense, they are all vocal: sing, shout, praise, proclaim, and say (or pray).\nWhat are we responding to? The regathering of the remnant of Jacob. To whom is this command addressed? The church, we who believe that the Bible is the Word of God and that we ought to obey it.\nGod is asking us to intercede for Israel. He is saying, “I am restoring My people. I am regathering them, and I am asking you to unite with Me and My purposes through prayer.” I think we must all face this as one of the mysterious facts about God: when He intends to do something, He will say to His people, “Pray that I will do it.” In other words, He says, “This is My intention, but it will not happen until you pray.”\nAs Christians, we have a tremendous responsibility to be totally committed to the outworking of God’s purposes in history.
