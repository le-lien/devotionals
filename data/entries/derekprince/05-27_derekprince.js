    "body": 'There is another important stage in achieving acceptance, and that is receiving acceptance from God’s people. This means finding your place in the body of Christ.\nYou see, as Christians, we are never isolated individuals. We are brought into a relationship with our fellow believers. That relationship is one of the ways in which our acceptance is worked out in our day-to-day living. It is not enough to be accepted by the Father in heaven.\nThat is the first step, and indeed the most important one. However, after that, acceptance has to find expression in our relationships with our fellow believers.\nCollectively, Christians constitute one body, with each Christian being a member of that body. None of us can say to our fellow believers,\n“I don’t need you.” We all need one another. God has created the body in such a way that the members are interdependent. None of them can function effectively on its own. That principle applies to each one of us.\nIt applies to you. You have to find your place in the body of Christ. You need the other members, and they need you. Finding your place in the body makes your acceptance a real, day-to-day experience.\nIf you are crying out in your heart for this kind of involvement, I suggest that you pray this prayer: “Lord, I long to dwell in Your house, to be part of a spiritual family of committed believers. If there are any barriers in me, I ask You to remove them. Guide me to a group where this longing of mine can be fulfilled, and help me to make the needed commitment to them. In the name of Jesus, amen.”\nThank You, Jesus, for Your work on the cross. I proclaim that I am open to finding my place in the body of Christ, as I just prayed. I proclaim that Jesus endured my rejection that I might have His acceptance with the Father. Amen.\nRejection: Cause and Cure (audio)\n176\nDECLARING GOD’S WORD\nDeclaring God’s Word text_vNZ.indd 176\n4/09/2013 11:38:16 a.m.\nWEEK 22:\nJesus was cut off by\ndeath that we might be\njoined to God eternally.\nFor He was cut off from the land of the living; for the transgressions of My people He was stricken.\n—Isaiah 53:8 ',
