    "body": 'In 1 Corinthians 5:7, Paul connected the Passover of the Old Testament with the crucifixion of Jesus:\nFor indeed Christ [the Messiah] , our Passover, was sacrificed for us.\nThere is a very clear application of the Passover to the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross. We can say that the Passover Lamb was killed almost twenty centuries ago, and His blood is in the basin. His blood has been shed, but the blood cannot protect us while it remains in the basin. We have to transfer the blood from the basin to the places where we live.\nUnder the old covenant, hyssop was used, but what do we use under the new covenant? The answer is our testimonies. Our personal testimonies take the blood out of the basin and apply it to our “houses”\n—to our lives, our situations, and our families. We overcome Satan when we testify personally to what the Word says the blood of Jesus does for us. ',
