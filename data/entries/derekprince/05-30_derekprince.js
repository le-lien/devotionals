    "body": 'The third aspect of the life we have in Christ is the consummation of the work of Jesus in eternity—an eternity spent in the presence of God rather than being eternally banished to hell.\nFor the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord.\n(1 Thessalonians 4:16–17)\nThe consummation of redemption is eternity in the presence of God. The last two chapters of Revelation describe our eternity in the presence of God:\nNow I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea\n[no more separation, no more bitterness] . Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.\n(Revelation 21:1–2)\nI believe the New Jerusalem is the church coming down out of heaven. And it is God’s permanent dwelling place. One of the supreme purposes of God in the church is to have a dwelling place where He can live permanently. Verse 3 says,  “And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, ‘Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God.’” ',
