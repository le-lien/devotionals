But how  were we bought back?\nKnowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, like silver or gold, from your aimless conduct received by tradition from your fathers, but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.\n(1 Peter 1:18–19)\nWe are redeemed by the precious blood of Jesus Christ—without blemish, without original sin; without spot, without personal sin—the sinless Lamb of God who took away the sins of the world. It is only through His blood that we are redeemed. There was no other amount that could pay the price to purchase our redemption. ',
