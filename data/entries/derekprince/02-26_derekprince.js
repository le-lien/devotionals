    "body": 'Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s.\n(1 Corinthians 6:19–20)\nThere are many ways in which we use our bodies. One primary activity consists of nourishing ourselves—eating and drinking.\nPaul said that we need to do those activities in a way that glorifies God: Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.\n(1 Corinthians 10:31)\nWhat does it mean to “eat…to the glory of God” ? I leave it to you to answer this question. Some people cannot even imagine they can give God glory by the way they eat. But God has said He is a jealous God (see, for example, Exodus 34:14), and He wants to be glorified in every aspect of life—especially the simple, daily, down-to-earth activities.\nBut let me ask you one more question. Is it possible to overeat to the glory of God? I can’t see that it is possible, since overeating is a form of self-indulgence. Proverbs 13:25 says, “The righteous eats to the satisfying of his soul.”  We are entitled to satisfaction, but if we go beyond that—beyond meeting our legitimate needs—then we are being self-indulgent.
