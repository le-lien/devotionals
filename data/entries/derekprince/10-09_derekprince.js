    "body": 'We can consider these questions as we meditate on this call to enter God’s rest: Are we making the best use of our time? Do we really know what it means to rest? Are we capable of disciplining ourselves to stop doing things—even mentally? Can we ever lie down and stop thinking about what we ought to be doing?\nGod is more concerned with character than with achievements.\nAchievements are important only in the realm of time, but character is eternal. It determines what we will be throughout eternity.\nIsaiah had a vision of heaven with glorious creatures and the throne of the Lord. (See Isaiah 6.) Worship was conducted in heaven by creatures called seraphim (Hebrew, seraph), a word that relates directly to the word for fire.  These are fiery creatures close to the throne of God, and they cried out day and night, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord”\n(Isaiah 6:3). Each one had six wings, which they used impressively. With two wings, they covered their faces; with two other wings, they covered their feet; and, with the two remaining wings, they flew. (See verse 2.) I interpret covering the face and feet as the humility of worship; I interpret flying as acts of service.\nI believe in the importance of thanking God and praising Him out loud—even dancing, clapping, and singing. But there comes a time when I will put my “wings” over my face and over my feet in humble worship and listen to hear what God says.\n“Today, if you will hear His voice: do not harden your hearts” (Psalm 95:7–8). Develop an attitude of worship and learn to rest. Remember, the Spirit of the Lord is looking for a certain type of person—one whose heart is perfect toward God. Be that person of character, and God will show Himself strong on your behalf. ',
