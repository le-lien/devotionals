    "body": 'In the book of Job, we find a beautiful summation of God’s creative work in forming our bodies:\nYour hands have made me and fashioned me, an intricate unity; yet You would destroy me. Remember, I pray, that You have made me like clay. And will You turn me into dust again? Did You not pour me out like milk, and curdle me like cheese,…?\n(Job 10:8–11)\nAs in Genesis 2:7, where the word “ formed”  indicates a very careful, skillful work, so, too, Job emphasizes the immense skill and care that God devoted to forming the human body. What vivid expressions!\nVerses 10–11 say,  “Did You not…clothe me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews?”  What a beautiful picture of the interrelationship of the various main parts of the body. In Psalm 139, David wrote, “Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them” (verse 16 kjv).\nGod brought your body into being on a blueprint, and there is a number for every member. Every member is written up in God’s book.\nCompare that statement with what Jesus said in Luke 12:7: “But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not fear therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.”  Such is the intensity of God’s concern for our physical bodies—He takes an interest in even the smallest details.\nWhen we realise this truth, we must also realise that God has a purpose for the marvelous workmanships that are our own bodies.
