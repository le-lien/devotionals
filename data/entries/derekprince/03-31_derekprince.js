    "body": 'In Psalm 89:34, God said, “My covenant I will not violate, nor will I alter the utterance of My lips” (nasb). It is of tremendous importance that we grasp the fact that when God makes a covenant, He will never break it. We need to know that.\nOur Bible consists of two covenants: the old and the new. Therefore, the essence of divine revelation is centered in covenant. If God were to break His covenant, we would have no hope. It is my personal conviction that if God were to break His covenant with Israel, we would have no reason to believe that He would not break His covenant with the church. You may say, “Well, Israel failed God.” Undoubtedly. But can you honestly say that the church has not also failed God?\nI am not capable of presenting God’s point of view, but in my limited understanding, I see Israel receiving a covenant and failing dismally. I see the church receiving a covenant and failing even worse than Israel.\nWhat is God saying to us about the restoration of Israel? I suggest that God is saying at least four things, all of them extremely topical, relevant, and important for the church of Jesus Christ.\nFirst, God is saying that the Bible is a true, relevant, up-to-date book.\nSecond, God is saying that He keeps His covenant.\nThird, God is saying to us that He is sovereign.

Every prophecy that relates to the close of this age is predicated on one important factor—the presence of Israel as a sovereign nation within its own borders.'
