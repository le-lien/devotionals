    "body": 'One of the great secrets of getting things from God is receiving.\nThere are many people who ask but never receive. There is a Scripture verse that is very emphatic about this principle of receiving.\nJesus was speaking about petitioning God, and He said, Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them.\n(Mark 11:24)\nThe New International Version  says, “Believe that you have received it,”  which is a more literal translation. We receive the things we ask for when we pray.  If you pray in that way—believing that when you pray, you receive—you will have what you ask for.\nNotice that receiving is not the same as having. Receiving is settling it; having is the experience that follows. Let’s say you have a financial need. You pray. You are in touch with God. You say, “God, we need fifteen hundred dollars by Thursday.” Then, you say, “Thank You, God.”\nYou have received it. Nothing has changed in your circumstances, but you have received it nevertheless. You will have it. ',
