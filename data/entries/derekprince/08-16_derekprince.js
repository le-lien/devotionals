    "body": 'I was once a professional philosopher. As such, I looked here, there, and everywhere for the answer to life’s problems. I looked in Christianity, as it was then presented to me, and concluded that Christianity did not have the answer. I was perfectly right—it didn’t. I turned to Greek philosophy, I turned to Yoga, I turned to all sorts of ridiculous things. Then, in 1941, in an army barrack room one evening around midnight, when no one else was awake, I had a personal encounter with the Lord Jesus Christ. And in that encounter, I discovered that I had met the answer.\nSometime later, I read something Paul wrote concerning Jesus Christ: “In [Him]  are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge”\n(Colossians 2:3 kjv). I said to myself, Why should I grub around any longer in the rubbish bins of human wisdom when all the treasures are hidden in Jesus Christ?  And I made a decision that the Bible is the book with the answers, and I resolved to find in it what God has hidden in Jesus Christ. ',

But Jesus is “the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last” (Revelation 22:13) and  “the author and finisher of our faith”  (Hebrews 12:2). We are complete in Him. If you ever start to look outside Christ, you will find all sorts of interesting theories and stimulating presentations, but you will be feeding on the husks when you could be living on the Father’s bread.'
