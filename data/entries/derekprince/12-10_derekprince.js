    "body": 'The tenth “Let us” step in the book of Hebrews is found near the end of chapter 12:\nTherefore, since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us show gratitude, by which we may offer to God an acceptable service with reverence and awe; for our God is a consuming fire.\n(Hebrews 12:28–29 nasb)\nWhere the version above says “Let us show gratitude,”  the King James and New King James Versions say, “Let us have grace” —and it is important that we understand the connection between grace and thanks.\nThe King James translation is a literal translation of the words—the phrase “to have grace” is commonly used in Greek to express the giving of thanks. This brings out the association between grace and thanks.\nThis connection is also found in various modern Romance languages.\nIn French, for instance, they say, “Grâce à Dieu,”  which means “Thanks to God”; in Italian, it is “grazie,”  and in Spanish, it is “gracias.”  All are taken from the same word for grace.\nIt is easy to see this connection between grace and thanks. In light of this fact, I want to tell you that you cannot have the grace of God in your life unless you practice giving thanks. Grace and thanks go together. There is nothing more ungracious than an unthankful person, whereas a thankful person will always experience the grace of God.\nGod requires two things of us as His people. First of all, He requires that we appreciate what He does for us. Second, He requires that we express our appreciation. It is important to understand our need to express appreciation to God.\nThank You, Lord, for all You have done for me. I proclaim that I appreciate what the Lord does for me, and I express that appreciation freely. I shall show gratitude. Amen. ',
