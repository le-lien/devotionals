    "body": 'Paul wrote to the church at Ephesus (and to us, as well), But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions….\nAnd God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus.\n(Ephesians 2:4–6 niv)\nNotice these three stages of identification with Jesus. First, we are made alive; second, we are raised up, or resurrected; and, third, we are seated with Him. Jesus is seated on the throne. So, what does it mean for us to be seated with Him? It means to be enthroned, to share the throne with Him.\nOnce we understand our identification with Jesus, we are invited to follow Him all the way. He is the “new and living way” (Hebrews 10:20). We can be made alive with Him, we can be resurrected with Him. But we need not stop there. We can be enthroned with Him.\nUsing the pattern of the tabernacle, I believe that the first curtain represents our sharing in the resurrection of Jesus. The second curtain that leads to the Most Holy Place represents what we enter through sharing in the ascension of Jesus. Jesus was not merely resurrected, but, subsequently, He also was raised up to heaven, to the throne. And that is where God wants us. God does not want us to stop short in this new and living way until we have reached the Most Holy Place, where we are sharing the throne with Jesus—seated with Him in heavenly places.\nThat is our destination.\nLet’s make it our resolution not to stop short of the place where God wants us to come.
