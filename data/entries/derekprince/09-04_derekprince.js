    "body": 'Closely related to the eternal nature of God is His omniscience.\nIn 1 John 3:20, we are confronted with a profound yet simple revelation: “God…knows all things.”  There is nothing that God does not know. From the tiniest insect in the earth to the most distant star in the galaxy, there is nothing that God does not know completely.\nGod knows things about us that we do not know about ourselves.\nAs I wrote yesterday, He knows the number of hairs on each of our heads. (See Matthew 10:30.)\nGod knew the number of inhabitants in the city of Nineveh. (See Jonah 4:11.)\nHe knew—and controlled—the growth of the plant that shaded Jonah. He also knew—and controlled—the action of the worm that caused the plant to wither. (See Jonah 4:6–7.) The apostle Paul wrote about the things that “eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man” (1 Corinthians 2:9).\nHe continued,  “But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God” (verse 10).\nThe Holy Spirit both plumbs the deepest depths and scales the highest heights of all that was, is, and is to come. His knowledge is infinite. It is in the light of this infinite knowledge that we must each be prepared to give an account of ourselves to God. “And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are naked and open to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account” (Hebrews 4:13).\nThank You, Father, that You know me completely. I proclaim that God’s knowledge is infinite—there is nothing He does not know. ',
