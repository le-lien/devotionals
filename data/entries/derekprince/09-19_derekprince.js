    "body": 'There is a popular teaching that convinces people that they must be super-spiritual to be considered sons of God. But Paul contradicted this idea in the eighth chapter of Romans, where he wrote that all who are led regularly by the Holy Spirit are indeed sons of God.  “For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God” (Romans 8:14). In one sense, if you are  already  perfect, you do not need the Holy Spirit. You need the Holy Spirit, though, if you are to become perfect.\nThe way to live as a real son or daughter of God is to be led regularly by the Holy Spirit. As Jesus said, “My sheep hear My voice,…and they follow Me”  (John 10:27). By “hear,”  Jesus meant regularly hear, regularly follow. This is not an up-and-down, once a week process; rather, it is a regular, continuing relationship.\nPaul continued in Romans 8:15, “For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, ‘Abba, Father.’”  The “spirit of bondage,”  very simply, is the law. Instead of being bound by the law, you have received the Spirit of God, who assures you of your identity as a child of God. As a child of God, you have all the rights of the inheritance. Paul assured us, “The Spirit Himself bears witness with our [regenerated] spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs [inheritance is the subject];\nheirs of God and joint heirs with Christ” (verses 16–17).\nMany people receive assurance of being children of God only when they are baptized in the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit comes in to assure you that you are a child of God and that you have a legal right to your inheritance. You are not merely born, but you are also adopted, and this passage clearly connects adoption and inheritance. ',
