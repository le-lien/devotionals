    "body": 'Jesus’ position as High Priest relates to our confession. Let’s look at three passages from the book of Hebrews. First, Hebrews 3:1 reads,\n“Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Christ Jesus.”  Jesus was the Apostle sent out by God to provide redemption. Having provided redemption, He returned to God to be our High Priest in the presence of God. He is the High Priest of our confession. That idea is radical: No confession, no High Priest. If we close our lips on earth, we silence our Advocate in heaven. The more we confess, the more we release His high priestly ministry on our behalf.\nNext, we’ll read Hebrews 4:14: “Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.”  To hold fast means to say something, then keep on saying it. Don’t back off. Don’t get discouraged.\nFinally, “Having a High Priest over the house of God,…let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful”  (Hebrews 10:21, 23). Notice the change there. It is not “the confession of our faith” but “the confession of our hope.”  If we confess\nfaith  long enough, it becomes  hope. “Faith is the substance of things hoped for”  (Hebrews 11:1). When we have built a substance of faith, then hope comes. My definition of biblical hope is “a confident expectation of good.” But we must hold fast the profession or confession without wavering. Why does it say “without wavering” ? Let me illustrate with the following image. When you are traveling in an airplane and the Fasten Seat Belt sign goes on, it tells you to expect turbulence. In the same way,  “without wavering”  tells you to expect opposition. The battle is fought and won when we maintain our confession.\nThank You, Jesus, that You are the High Priest of our confession.\nI proclaim that Jesus is my Advocate in heaven, in the presence of God, and I hold fast that confession without wavering.
