    "body": 'How do we align ourselves with God’s purpose for Israel? I want to suggest one simple way. In Isaiah 40:1–2, God said, “‘Comfort, yes, comfort My people!’ says your God. ‘Speak comfort to Jerusalem, and cry out to her, that her warfare is ended, that her iniquity is pardoned; for she has received from the Lord’s hand double for all her sins.’”\nI have analyzed that verse, and where it says “comfort My people,”\nbecause of the immediate reference to Jerusalem, I understand it to mean the Jewish people. The Jewish people cannot be comforted apart from Jerusalem. Their hearts are totally bound up with the city of Jerusalem. So, if I am right, and “My people” is the Jewish people, to whom are these words spoken? They are spoken in the plural (in Hebrew) to somebody who would say, “Comfort My people.”  They must be spoken to people who accept the God of the Bible and the authority of His Word. Who can that be? You and me. People like us, believing Christians. What does God say? “Comfort My people, Israel.” God requires us to comfort Israel.\nI have been friends with a number of Jewish believers in Jesus, and one thing that they will point out to me is the fact that the church worldwide spends much more time criticizing Israel than comforting Israel. We were not called to criticize; rather, we have been commanded to comfort. Will you accept that responsibility?\nI believe this comforting is one way of preparing the way of the Lord. Centuries of prejudice, alienation, and misunderstanding must be broken down. They must be melted away by the warmth of real Christian love. I believe that is our assignment at this time. ',
