    "body": 'The sacrificial death of Jesus on the cross is the only basis of God’s provision for every need of the whole human race. Instead of God doing a lot of different actions at different times, Scripture says, “By one offering [sacrifice]  He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified” (Hebrews 10:14).\nThe writer of Hebrews explained that after Jesus had offered that one sacrifice, He  “sat down at the right hand of God”  (verse 12). Why did He sit down? Because He was never going to have to do it again.\nThrough His work on the cross, Jesus administered to Satan and his kingdom a total, permanent, irreversible defeat. Jesus will never have to do that work again. Satan has already been defeated. You and I do not have to defeat Satan. But we must apply the victory that Jesus has already won and walk in that victory.\nWe read in Colossians 1:12, “Giving thanks to the Father who has qualified us to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in the light.”\nOur inheritance is in the light, and there is no darkness whatsoever in it. It is totally in the light. How has He done it?\nHe has delivered us from the power [I prefer to say “domain”]\nof darkness and conveyed [translated]  us into the kingdom of the Son of His love, in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins.\n(verses 13–14)\nBy redemption through the blood of Jesus, we have been delivered from the domain of darkness and translated, or carried over, into the kingdom of the Son of God’s love.
