    "body": 'We must emphasize the vital importance of faith. I say to you what Jesus said to Peter: “I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail” (Luke 22:32). Faith is the basic requirement for belonging to God and being a child of Abraham, who is “the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of the faith which our father Abraham had while still uncircumcised”\n(Romans 4:12). Abraham is more than just a figure—he is a pattern.\nHe went ahead, laid out the pathway, and took certain steps. To be truly his descendants, we must walk in that pathway and follow in his steps. Let’s look at the five steps of the faith of Abraham: (1) he accepted God’s promise by faith alone, without evidence; (2) he recognized that he was incapable of producing the results on his own; (3) he focused on the promise without wavering, and this faith was reckoned to him as righteousness; (4) as a result, Sarah and he both received supernatural life in their bodies; and (5) thus, the promise was fulfilled, and God was glorified.

      "text": 'Those are the steps of the faith of our father Abraham—the pathway of faith that is set before every one of us. It is not some external ordinance but a lifetime walk of faith, following in the footsteps of Abraham. We must do as Abraham did. We have to accept God’s promise just the way it is. We have to reckon that we are incapable of producing what God has promised in our lives. We have to focus on the promise and not on our own ability—or inability. And then, we will receive the supernatural grace and power of God released in our lives through our faith. In this way, the promise of God will be fulfilled in our lives.'
