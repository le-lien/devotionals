    "body": 'When Jesus died on the cross, the veil in the temple separating a holy God from sinful man was torn in two, a declaration that we can have His acceptance. (See, for example, Matthew 27:51.) It was torn from top to bottom so that nobody could ever say that a man was responsible. This act was done by God. The torn veil is the Father’s invitation to every person who believes in Jesus, “Come in; you are welcome. My Son has endured your rejection so that I may offer you My acceptance.”\nBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ, just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world.\n(Ephesians 1:3–4)\nNotice that this ultimate choice is not ours, but God’s. Do not imagine that you are saved because you chose to be saved! You are saved because God chose you, and you responded to His choice. You might change your mind, but God does not change His.\nThere is a great deal of misplaced emphasis in many contemporary presentations of the gospel that seems to indicate that everything depends on what we do. It is true that we have to choose, but we would never be able to choose if God had not chosen us in the first place. You will find you are much more secure as a Christian when you are basing your relationship with God not on what you do but on what God has done. God is more dependable than you and I!\nThank You, Father, that I am Your child. I proclaim that I am a child of God, based not on what I do, but on what God has done.\nIn love, my Father has predestined me to be adopted as His son or daughter. Amen.\nAtonement, Vol.2: Rejection vs. Acceptance (audio) 288\nDECLARING GOD’S WORD\nDeclaring God’s Word text_vNZ.indd 288\n4/09/2013 11:38:26 a.m.\nWEEK 36:\nMy Father knows\nwhat I need, even\nbefore I ask Him.
