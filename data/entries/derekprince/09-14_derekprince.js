    "body": 'I have written a little booklet entitled Orphans, Widows, the Poor and Oppressed.  This booklet astonishes me. As I wrote yesterday, even after I had been preaching for well over fifty years, and when I had the impression that I would be preaching for the rest of my life, God gave me a new kind of compassion I never expected to receive. My rendering of Psalm 84:6 is, “When you pass through the Valley of Baca [weeping], God will open a fountain.”\nI have passed through the valley of weeping, and God has opened that fountain for me. It is something sovereign that only God could do. It is compassion. I have become deeply concerned—almost passionately—\nabout the people our society neglects and treads underfoot: the orphans, the widows, the poor, and the oppressed. I am amazed by how much the Bible has to say about our responsibility to care for them. From cover to cover of the Bible, it is a major theme of God’s righteousness—whether it is in the Patriarchs, under the Law of Moses, in the Prophets, or in the New Testament.\nGenerally speaking, we, as Christians, have completely missed a vital area of our faith and our profession, which is to care for those whom no one else cares for.

I proclaim the truth of Psalm 84:6: “When you pass through the Valley of Baca\n[weeping], God will open a fountain.” I proclaim that I will walk in this vital area of faith and profession, caring for those for whom no one else cares. As a father has compassion on his children, so God has compassion on me. Amen.'
