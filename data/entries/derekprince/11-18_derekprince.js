    "body": 'When the priest entered the Most Holy Place with the incense and the blood, he had to sprinkle the blood seven times on the mercy seat, which was a picture of the atonement, and seven times in front of the mercy seat. God’s ordinance was absolutely specific—not six times, not eight times, but seven times. Then, in Isaiah, we find a prophetic picture of the suffering of Jesus—the clearest picture in the Old Testament of Jesus’ suffering for our sins.\nTherefore I [the Lord] will divide Him [Jesus]  a portion with the great, and He shall divide the spoil with the strong, because He poured out His soul unto death.\n(Isaiah 53:12)\nIt is important for us to understand that the word in Isaiah 53:12\nthat is translated as “soul”  is the same word that appears in Leviticus 17:11 and is translated as “life” : “The life [soul] of the flesh [every human being] is in the blood.”  When Jesus made atonement for our sins, He poured out His soul in His blood. His blood is the most precious blood in the universe because in that blood is the soul life of God, the Creator.\nThere is more power in one drop of the blood of Jesus than in all parts of the kingdom of Satan put together. The lifeblood of Jesus is the life of God the Creator—a life that is greater than the entire universe and all the creatures He ever created. That life is released only through the blood of Jesus. He became the Life-giver when He shed His blood.\nWe should never turn away from the blood of Jesus. There is no other atonement for sin, and no other source of life. One of our big problems, brothers and sisters, is not meditating enough on the blood.\nThank You, Lord, that I can draw near to You by the blood of Jesus. I proclaim that life is released only through the blood of Jesus—the only source of life. I shall draw near to the Most Holy Place. Amen.\nThe Life-giver (audio)\n376\nDECLARING GOD’S WORD\nDeclaring God’s Word text_vNZ.indd 376\n4/09/2013 11:38:33 a.m.\nWEEK 47:\nLet us hold fast our\nconfession\nwithout wavering.\nLet us hold fast the confession of our ',
