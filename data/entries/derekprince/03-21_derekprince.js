    "body": 'Looking at the book of Job, we see some tremendous revelations about the body. In many ways, there’s a wonderful interrelationship between the books of Genesis and Job. Job 10:8–12 is a beautiful summation of God’s creative work in our bodies. Verse 8 reads,  “Your hands have made me and fashioned me, an intricate unity.”\nAs in Genesis 2:7, where the word “ formed”  indicates a skillful work that results from great care, so the book of Job emphasizes the immeasurable skill and care that God devoted to forming the human body:\nYour hands have made me and fashioned me, an intricate unity; yet You would destroy me. Remember, I pray, that You have made me like clay. And will You turn me into dust again?\nDid You not pour me out like milk, and curdle me like cheese, clothe me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews?\n(Job 10:8–11)\nWhat a vivid expression! What a beautiful picture of the interrelationship of the various primary parts of the body. We read on in verse 12, “You have granted me life and favor, and Your care [“visitation”\nkjv]  has preserved my spirit.”\nLater on in Job, we have the other aspect—the spiritual part—of man’s nature: “But there is a spirit in man, and the breath [“inspiration”\nkjv]  of the Almighty gives him understanding” (Job 32:8).\nThese words from Job are in perfect accord with those from Genesis. It is the union of the breath of God from above with the clay from beneath that brings into being a total human personality. ',
