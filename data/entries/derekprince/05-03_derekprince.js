We do not need to speculate about that, because it is specifically revealed in Scripture.\nNow Abraham was old, well advanced in age; and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things.\n(Genesis 24:1)\nThis verse might give you the impression that Abraham was hobbling around with a cane, but it just says that he was “well advanced in age.”  It is pretty obvious that he was not hobbling around with a cane because, quite a number of years later, he made a long journey to Mount Moriah and came back again.

In this connection, Paul said that we must receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. I believe this means that we can receive the blessing only through receiving the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is the administrator of all our blessed inheritance.'
