    "body": 'God knows each of us totally, even beyond knowing how many hairs are on our heads. (See Matthew 10:30.) In this beautiful passage from Psalms, David began with what seems like a gasp of astonishment:\nO Lord, Thou hast searched me and known me. Thou dost know when I sit down and when I rise up; Thou dost understand my thought from afar. Thou dost scrutinize my path and my lying down, and art intimately acquainted with all my ways. Even before there is a word on my tongue, behold, O Lord, Thou dost know it all. Thou hast enclosed me behind and before, and laid Thy hand upon me. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is too high, I cannot attain to it. Where can I go from Thy Spirit?\nOr where can I flee from Thy presence? (Psalm 139:1–7 nasb) Think about what David said: God knows our thoughts from a distance. A man who once had a revelation of God related that the angel who brought the revelation told him, “Men’s thoughts sound as loud in heaven as their voices do on earth.” That was a shock to me. But that is essentially what David said here.\nSurely, when we consider all of that, we must echo these words of David: “Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is too high, I cannot attain to it.”  David asked, “Where can I go from Thy Spirit?”  That is the key that explains how God knows everything in the whole universe—\nthrough His Spirit. The Spirit of God permeates the entire universe; there is no place where the Spirit of God is not present. Through His Spirit, God knows everything that we know, and more—He knows things we can never know, such as the number of hairs on our heads.\nThank You, Father, that You know me completely. I proclaim that through His Spirit, God knows everything that I know about myself and more. My Father knows what I need, even before I ask Him. Amen. ',
