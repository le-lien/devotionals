    "body": 'For He [God]  delivered us from the domain of darkness, and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.\n(Colossians 1:13–14 nasb)\nThrough our faith in Jesus and His sacrificial death, God has delivered us from the domain of darkness. Notice that word domain. In the original Greek, it is authority. Satan has authority over the disobedient, the unbelieving, and the unsaved. But through Jesus, God has delivered us from that domain of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love, in whom we have redemption.\nNote the key word redemption. We have been bought back. We are no longer under the power of the curse, because of the redeeming death and shed blood of Jesus Christ.\nFor this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil.\n(1 John 3:8)\nWhy did Jesus come? To destroy the works of the devil. That includes the curse!\nBehold, I give you the authority to trample on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you.\n(Luke 10:19)\nSatan may have power, but Jesus has given us power over the power of Satan, so that “nothing shall by any means hurt [us] .” ',
