    "body": 'Here are a few suggestions regarding how to treat your body as a temple for the Holy Spirit.\nFirst of all, treat your body with reverence because it is a temple of the Holy Spirit, whom we revere. Among contemporary Christians, I find there is very little reverence for the body.\nSecond, seek the help of the Holy Spirit in cultivating self-discipline.\nThird, take the time and make the effort to distinguish between that which is helpful and that which is harmful.\nFourth, be willing to be radical because your life is at stake.\nFifth, seek to cooperate with the Holy Spirit.\nThere are many other steps I could add to this list, but these I have acquired through experience. I was challenged by the Lord to consider whether I was leading a life of self-indulgence. I was challenged by the Lord to consider these questions: Do I want to go on living? Do I want to finish my assigned task? Jesus said to His disciples, “My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to finish His work” (John 4:34).\nThat is the best diet: to do the will of Him who sent us—and to finish His work. Even after spending more than fifty years in the Lord’s service, I believed there were certain tasks assigned to me by God that I had not yet fulfilled. I never took it for granted that I would fulfill them.\nI always took care of my body, knowing the importance of keeping myself in good physical condition so my life would not be cut short before I had finished God’s work.\nThank You, Lord, for the blood of Jesus and the work of Your Holy Spirit. I proclaim that I will cooperate with the Holy Spirit, keeping myself in good physical condition to finish His work. My body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, redeemed, cleansed, and sanctified by the blood of Jesus. Amen.\nUpdate 92 – July 2000 (audio)\n80\nDECLARING GOD’S WORD\nDeclaring God’s Word text_vNZ.indd 80\n4/09/2013 11:38:06 a.m.\nWEEK 10:\nMy members, the\nparts of my body,\nare instruments\nof righteousness,\nyielded to God for\nHis service and for\nHis glory.\nDo not present your members as\ninstruments of unrighteousness to sin,\nbut present yourselves to God as being ',
