    "body": 'For through the grace given to me I say to every man among you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think; but to think so as to have sound judgment, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith. For just as we have many members in one body and all the members do not have the same function, so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.\n(Romans 12:3–5 nasb)\nThe renewed mind directs us to our proper place in the body. We come to realise that each of us is just one member, incomplete on our own, incapable of functioning on our own as God intends us to function. In order to be complete and to function in accordance with God’s purpose and plan, each of us has to become a member in the body. We have to be joined to other members by a kind of commitment that enables us to work together, and not just as isolated individuals.\nWhen traveling on airplanes, I have often marveled as the plane’s navigation system zeroed in on the particular airport and the two locked on to one another. The plane came down in exactly the right place at exactly the right speed to make a safe and smooth landing. I suggest thinking of your renewed mind like the navigation system of an airplane. When you synchronize yourself with the Spirit of God, then your renewed mind brings you down into exactly the right place in the body—you become a member of God’s body, the body of Christ, the church.
