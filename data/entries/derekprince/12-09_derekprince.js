    "body": 'One of the consistent themes of Hebrews is the danger of going back on your profession of faith in Christ. There are five distinct passages in Hebrews that warn us of the danger of going back. These are some of the most solemn words in Scripture. Therefore, one of the key words that Hebrews emphasizes is this word that we are looking at:  endurance.\nAnd we desire that each one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope until the end, that you do not become sluggish, but imitate those who through faith and patience\n[endurance]  inherit the promises.\n(Hebrews 6:11–12)\nFaith and endurance. Some people will tell you that faith is all you need to claim God’s promise. But that is not true. You need faith and endurance. It takes both. As the author of Hebrews continued,\n“Therefore do not cast away your confidence, which has great reward.\nFor you have need of endurance, so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise” (Hebrews 10:35–36).\nThe word confidence  means that you have freedom of speech. You can talk boldly about Jesus—about what He has done for you and what He is will do for you. You have done the will of God, but you have not yet received the promises. What do you need? Endurance. You need to hold out from the point where you did God’s will and claimed the promise to the point where you actually receive the promise. Some people do the will of God and claim the promise, but they don’t hold out. Then, they say that it didn’t work. But it will not work without endurance. You need faith and endurance.\nThank You, Lord, for helping me to “press on.” I proclaim that I endure to the end by faith, holding out to do God’s will and claiming the promises. I shall run the race with endurance. Amen.\nCharacter That Stands the Test (Teaching Legacy Letter)\nDECLARING GOD’S WORD\nDeclaring God’s Word text_vNZ.indd 400\n4/09/2013 11:38:36 a.m.\nWEEK 50:\nLet us show gratitude.\nTherefore, since we receive a kingdom\nwhich cannot be shaken, let us show\ngratitude, by which we may offer to God ',
