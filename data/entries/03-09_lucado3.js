Another on your shoulder during a terrible day? A smile of welcome at a new class?\nCan’t we offer the same?\nMaybe you already do. You have the master touch of the Physician himself, and you use your hands to serve too. Maybe they do so by typing encouraging e-mails or helping up the new kid on the team after he’s fouled.\nOr you’ve used your hands to bake cookies for a church bake sale or to take juice to your mom when she’s sick. You have learned the power of a touch.\nBut others of us tend to forget. Our hearts are good; it’s just that our memories are bad. We forget how significant one touch can be. Aren’t we glad Jesus didn’t make the same mistake? He touched a man with leprosy and cured him instantly (Matthew 8:3). Jesus reminds us that we also have the power of a godly touch. ',
