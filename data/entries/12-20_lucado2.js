    "body": '“Knitted together” is how the psalmist described the process of God making man. Not manufactured or mass-produced, but knitted. Each thread of personality tenderly intertwined. Each string of temperament deliberately selected.\nGod as creator. Pensive. Excited. Inventive.\nAn artist, brush on pallet, seeking the perfect shade.\nA composer, fingers on keyboard, listening for the exact chord.\nA poet, pen poised on paper, awaiting the precise word.\nThe Creator, the master weaver, threading together the soul.\nEach one different. No two alike. None identical.',
