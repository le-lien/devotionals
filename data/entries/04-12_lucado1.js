Jeering mouths of the crowd are silent. Perhaps there is thunder.\nPerhaps there is weeping. Perhaps there is silence. Then Jesus draws in a deep breath, pushes his feet down on that Roman nail, and cries, “It is finished!”\nWhat was finished?\nThe history-long plan of redeeming man was finished. The message of God to man was finished. The works done by Jesus as a man on earth were finished… . The sting of death had been removed. It was over. ',
