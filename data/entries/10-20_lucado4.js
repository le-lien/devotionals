It was the seed of choice. It would let the man—and all people after him—choose for themselves whether to follow God or not. No other creature in all the earth was given that choice.\nGod had given the man a part of Himself—that seed of choice. The God of might had created earth’s mightiest. The Creator had created not just another creature but another creator. And the One who had chosen to love had created one who could love in return. Adam had a choice: to love God or turn away from Him.\nAnd now it’s your turn to choose to love God! ',

When your feet first hit the floor in the morning, say, “I choose God.” For every tough decision you face during the day, declare, “I choose God.” And before you go to sleep at night, pray, “I choose God.”'
