    "body": 'Great acts of faith are seldom born out of calm and ordered thinking.\nIt wasn’t logic that caused Moses to raise his staff on the bank of the Red Sea and expect the water to withdraw. It wasn’t common sense that caused Paul to abandon his life as a Pharisee and embrace grace. And it wasn’t a confident committee that prayed in a small room in Jerusalem for Peter’s release from jail. It was a fearful, frantic band of backed-into-a-corner believers. It was a church with no options. A congregation of have-nots pleading for help. “The church was earnestly praying to God for him” (Acts 12:5 NIV). And never were they stronger. They prayed Peter right out of prison.\nLast-chance prayers often have the most power. The impact of impulsive acts can spread like wildfire. If, that is, they depend on God’s fuel to ignite the spark. At the beginning of every great deed of faith, there is often more than a flicker of desperation. ',
