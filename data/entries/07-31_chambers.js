      "text": 'Let your endurance be a finished product, so that you may be finished and complete, with never a defect.”  James 1:4 (MOFFATT) Many of us are all right in the main, but there are some domains in which we are slovenly. It is not a question of sin, but of the remnants of the carnal life which are apt to make us slovenly. Slovenliness is an insult to the Holy Ghost. There should be nothing slovenly, whether it be in the way we eat and drink, or in the way we worship God.'

    "body": 'He never tires of bringing us to the one point until we learn the lesson, because He is producing the finished product. It may be a question of impulse, and again and again, with the most persistent patience, God has brought us back to the one particular point; or it may be mental wool-gathering, or independent individuality. God is trying to impress upon us the one thing that is not entirely right.\nWe have been having a wonderful time this Session over the revelation of God’s Redemption, our hearts are perfect towards Him; His wonderful work in us makes us know that in the main we are right with Him. “Now,” says the Spirit, through St. James, “let your endurance be a finished product.” Watch the slipshod bits - “Oh, that will have to do for now.” Whatever it is, God will point it out with persistence until we are entirely His.
