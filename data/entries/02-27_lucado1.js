He canceled the debt, which listed all the rules we failed to follow. He took away that record with its rules and nailed it to the cross. God stripped the spiritual rulers and powers of their authority. With the cross, he won the victory and showed the world that they were powerless” (Col. 2:13–15).\nAs you look at the words above, answer this question. Who is doing the work? You or God? Who is active? You or God? Who is doing the saving?\nYou or God? ',
