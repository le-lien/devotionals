    "body": 'The Bible says that “those who are in Christ Jesus are not judged guilty”\n(Romans 8:1). It also says that God will “make right any person who has faith in Jesus” (3:26).\nThat is great news for God’s children! Because sometimes, even when you want  to do right, you do wrong. We all do. That’s why God’s promises are so wonderful! If you believe in Jesus and obey Him, God promises that your sins will all be taken away and that they will be hidden by Jesus. So when God looks at you, He doesn’t see your sin; He sees the One who saves you—Jesus. ',
