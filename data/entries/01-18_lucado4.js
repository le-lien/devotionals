Water it with a prayer and add a sunny smile—\nand then watch what happens.\nWant to see some more miracles? Fix a snack for your mom or dad without being asked. Smile at your teacher just because. Give a friend a pat on the back when she’s had a tough day. Draw something special for a person who is sick. Bring in the mail or the newspaper for an older neighbor. Offer to clean up even when it’s not your turn.\nSowing seeds of kindness is like sowing beans. You don’t know how they grow or why; you just know they do. And somehow that one little seed of kindness that you plant will grow into a whole garden of good deeds. ',
