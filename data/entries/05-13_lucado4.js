The  question.\n“Who do you say I am?”\nHe didn’t ask, “What do you think about all the miracles I’ve done?” He asked, “Who do you say I am?”\nHe didn’t ask, “Who do your friends think I am? Or your parents? Or who does the preacher think I am?” Instead He asked a very personal question, “Who do you  think I am?”\nYou will be asked some important questions in your life: What do you want to be when you grow up?\nWho will you marry?\nWhere will you live?\nBut the greatest, most important question of all these kinds of questions is an anthill compared to the mountain of a question that Jesus asked in Mark 8:29.
