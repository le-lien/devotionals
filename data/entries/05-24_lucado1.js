For confessing sins—admitting failure—is exactly what prisoners of pride refuse to do.\n“Me a sinner? Oh sure, I get rowdy every so often, but I’m a pretty good ol’ boy.”\n“Listen, I’m just as good as the next guy. I pay my taxes… .”\nJustification. Rationalization. Comparison. . . . They sound good. They sound familiar. They even sound American. But in the kingdom, they sound hollow… .\nWhen you get to the point of sorrow for your sins, when you admit that you have no other option, . . . then cast all your cares on him for he is waiting. ',
