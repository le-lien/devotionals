He prayed for the impossible to happen.\nOr maybe I’m wrong. Maybe he didn’t ask for anything. Maybe he just stood quietly in the presence of Presence and basked in the Majesty.\nPerhaps he placed his war-weary self before the throne and rested.\nMaybe he lifted his head out of the confusion of earth long enough to hear the solution of heaven. Perhaps he was reminded that hard hearts don’t faze the Father. That problem people don’t perturb the Eternal One. ',
