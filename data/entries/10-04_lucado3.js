    "body": 'The problem with this world is that it doesn’t fit. It’s like a T-shirt that’s two sizes too small. Oh, it will do for now, but it isn’t tailor-made. We were made to live with God, but on earth we live by faith. We were made to live forever, but on this earth we live but for a moment.\nWe must trust God. We must trust not only that he does what is best but that he knows what’s ahead. Think about the words of Isaiah 57:1–2: “The good men perish; the godly die before their time, and no one seems to care or wonder why. No one seems to realize that God is taking them away from evil days ahead. For the godly who die shall rest in peace” (TLB).\nWhat a thought. God is taking them away from the evil days ahead.\nCould death be God’s grace? As bad as the grave seems now, could it be God’s protection from the future?\nOnly God knows what’s around the corner. Maybe we should let him do the driving. ',
