Poof!\nNow what do you do? … When we fall, we can dismiss it. We can deny it. We can distort it. Or we can deal with it… .\nWe keep no secrets from God.

How can God grant us pardon when we won’t admit our guilt? Ahh, there’s that word: guilt. Isn’t that what we avoid? Guilt. Isn’t that what we detest? But is guilt so bad? What does guilt imply if not that we know right from wrong, that we aspire to be better than we are… . That’s what guilt is: a healthy regret for telling God one thing and doing another. ',
