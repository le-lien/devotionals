Just look at the gifts [God] has given you:\nHe has sent his angels to care for you, his Holy Spirit to dwell in you, his church to encourage you, and his word to guide you… .\nAnytime you speak, he listens; make a request and he responds.\nHe will never let you be tempted too much or stumble too far.\nLet a tear appear on your cheek, and he is there to wipe it.\nLet a love sonnet appear on your lips, and he is there to hear it.\nAs much as you want to see him, he wants to see you more… .\nYou have been chosen by Christ… . He has claimed you as his beloved. ',
