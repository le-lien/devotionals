    "body": 'hat it means for people to have faith! What it will mean when we all have faith! We know that as soon as faith is W in perfect operation, we will be in the place where God is manifested right before our eyes. The pure in heart will see God (Matt. 5:8), and all the steps of purity are a divine appointment of more faith. The more purity, the more faith.\n\nWhen Lazarus died and Jesus knew that Mary, Martha, and everyone around them had lost confidence and faith, He turned to the Father in prayer and said, “Father…I know that You always hear Me”  (John 11:41–42). Jesus commanded Lazarus to come out of the tomb; death had to give him up, and everything had to come to pass as He said.\n\nFellowship, purity, unity—these things reflect a living cooperation in which we are being changed from faith to faith. May the Lord grant to you this thought today: How may I more and more abandon myself from any earthly, human fellowship, until I am absolutely so bound to God that God has the right-of-way to the throne of my heart, until the center of my emotions is blessedly purified, until there is no room for anything except the Son of God, who is the Author and Finisher of faith (Heb. 12:2)? Then Christ will be manifested in your flesh, destroying everything that is outside of Him.',
