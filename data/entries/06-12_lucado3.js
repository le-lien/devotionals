    "body": 'Have bad things really happened to you? You and God may have different definitions for the word bad. Maybe your dictionary defines it as “pimple on nose” or “pop quiz in geometry.” “Dad, this is really bad!” you say. Dad, having been around the block a time or two, thinks differently. He understands that pimples pass.\nWhat you and I might rate as an absolute disaster, God may rate as a pimple-level problem that will pass. He views your life the way you view a movie after you’ve read the book. When something bad happens, you feel the air sucked out of the theater. Everyone else gasps at the crisis on the screen.\nNot you. Why? You’ve read the book. You know how the good guy gets out of the tight spot. God views your life with the same confidence. He’s not only read your story … he wrote it. ',
