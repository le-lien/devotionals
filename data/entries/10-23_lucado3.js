    "body": 'Fashion designers tell us, “You’ll be somebody if you wear our jeans. Stick our name on your rear end, and insignificance will vanish.” For a while, fashion redeems us from the world of littleness and nothingness, and we are something else. But then, horror of horrors, the styles change, the fad passes, and we’re left wearing yesterday’s jeans, feeling like yesterday’s news.\nFear of insignificance creates the result it dreads. If a basketball player stands at the foul line repeating, “I’ll never make the shot,” guess what? He’ll never make the shot. If you pass your days mumbling, “I’ll never make a difference; I’m not worth anything,” guess what? You will be sentencing yourself to a life of gloom.\nEven more, you are disagreeing with God. According to him you were\n“skillfully wrought” (Psalm 139:15). You were “fearfully and wonderfully made” (v. 14). If you could count his thoughts of you, “they would be more in number than the sand” (v. 18).\nWhy does he love you so much? The same reason the artist loves his paintings or the boat builder loves his vessels. You are his idea. ',
