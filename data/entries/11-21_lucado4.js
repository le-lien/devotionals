    "body": 'The different Bible translations can help us better understand God’s Word. The New International Version of the Bible writes Hebrews 11:6 this way: “God . . . rewards those who earnestly seek him.” But the New King James Version ®  says, “He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.”\nDiligently—what a great word! It’s a big word that means “never give up, keep going no matter what.” Be diligent  in your search for Jesus. Stop searching the Internet and search for Jesus. Don’t just read this book about Jesus. Read dozens of them, starting with His book, the Bible.\nDon’t be satisfied with a once-a-week Sunday school lesson. Be like the heroes of the Bible and diligently  search for Jesus each day. Worship Him as the wise men did. Do as Matthew did: invite Jesus into your house. Be like Zacchaeus: climb a tree. Do whatever it takes to see Jesus. ',
