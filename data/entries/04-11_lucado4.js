    "body": 'It was the day of Jesus’ crucifixion. God looked around the hill and saw the scene. Three men hung on three crosses. Arms spread. Heads fallen forward. They moaned with the wind.\nSome Roman soldiers sat on the ground near the three crosses.\nHeartbroken women huddled at the foot of the hill … their faces streaked with tears.\nThe Bible tells us that all heaven stood ready to fight—“12 armies of angels” could have been sent to save Jesus (Matthew 26:53). All nature rose up, ready to rescue Him as darkness covered the “whole country” and “the earth shook and rocks broke apart” (Matthew 27:45, 51). Still the angels waited to protect. But the Creator never gave the order to save His Son. ',

      "text": 'Growing in Grace What does love mean to you? Is it just hugs and kisses and presents on holidays? God’s love is so much more. It’s giving up what you want so you can give to another. It’s choosing to be last so another can be first. It’s helping even when it’s hard. That’s what love is.'
