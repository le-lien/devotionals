    "body": 'Ilove to hear my wife say “whoever.” Sometimes I detect my favorite fragrance wafting from the kitchen: strawberry cake. Soon I’m standing over the just-baked, just-iced pan of pure pleasure. Yet I’ve learned to hold my fork until Denalyn gives clearance. “Who is it for?” I ask. She might break my heart. “It’s for a birthday party, Max. Don’t touch it!” Or she might throw open the door of delight. “Whoever.”\nWho isn’t a whoever? The word sledgehammers racial fences and dynamites social classes. It bypasses gender borders and surpasses outdated traditions. Whoever makes it clear: God’s grace is meant for the world. For those who attempt to restrict it, Jesus has a word.\n“Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven” (Matthew 10:32 NIV). “Whoever does God’s will is my brother and sister and mother” (Mark 3:35 NIV). “Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned” (Mark 16:16 NIV).\nWe lose much in life—friends, dreams, chances. We lose at love. But we never lose our place on God’s “whoever” list.\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
