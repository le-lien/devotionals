Oops.\nIt didn’t look like the wrong plane, but it was. I walked through the wrong gate, fell asleep on the wrong flight, and ended up in the wrong place.\nPaul said we’ve all done the same thing. Not with airplanes and airports, but with our lives and with God. He said: “There is no one without sin.\nNone!” (Romans 3:10). “All people have sinned and are not good enough for God’s glory” (v. 23). ',

Sometimes bad choices look like good ones. Only the One in charge knows the difference. Check with Him before you choose.'
