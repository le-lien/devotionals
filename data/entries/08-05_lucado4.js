What do you love to do? What makes you happy? What gives you a sense of satisfaction?  God will use those things in His plan for your life.\nSome people feel a need to help the poor. Others enjoy leading others at church. Each of us has been made to serve God in our own special way. ',

Just as the wind turns the direction of the weather vane, so God uses the things you love to do to turn the direction of your life. God is too kind to ask you to do something you hate.',
      "text": 'Growing in Grace As you search for your life’s mission, ask yourself these questions: What do you love to do? What is your favorite part of church? What makes you smile the most? Now find people in your church who have those same interests and ask them how they use their interests to serve God.'
