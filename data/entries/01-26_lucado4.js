She needed a break.\n“Martha, Martha, you are getting worried and upset about too many things,” Jesus said to her. “Only one thing is important. Mary has chosen the right thing, and it will never be taken away from her” (Luke 10:41–42).\nWhat had Mary chosen? She had chosen to sit at the feet of Christ. You see, God is more pleased with your quiet attention than with your whiny work.\nThe heart behind your work—why you do it—matters more than what type of work you do. A bad attitude spoils the gift of your work for God.\nBut a good attitude makes heaven smile. ',
