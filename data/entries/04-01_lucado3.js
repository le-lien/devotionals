    "body": 'In my closet hangs a sweater that I seldom wear. It’s too small. I should throw that sweater away. But love won’t let me.\nIt’s the creation of a devoted mother expressing her love. My mother.\nEach strand was chosen with care. Each thread was selected with affection. It is valuable not because of its function but because of its maker.\nThat must have been what the psalmist had in mind when he wrote, “You knit me together in my mother’s womb” (Psalm 139:13 NIV). Think on those words. You were knitted together. You aren’t an accident. You weren’t mass-produced. You aren’t an assemblyline product.\nYou’re no April fool. You were deliberately planned, specifically gifted, and lovingly positioned on this earth by the Master Craftsman. When he gazes upon you, he doesn’t see an ordinary lump of clay. He sees a beautiful work of art, uniquely molded and shaped according to his loving design. ',
