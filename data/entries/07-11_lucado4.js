    "body": 'Exactly what is praise? I like King David’s definition: “Tell the greatness of the Lord with me. Let us praise his name together” (Psalm 34:3).\nPraise is telling the Lord how great He is. It is magnifying  Him. That is, praise is making our view of God—His power, His might, and His majesty\n—even bigger. Growing our understanding of Him. Kind of like stepping into the cockpit of creation to see where God the Pilot sits and to watch how He works.\nOf course, God’s size doesn’t change, but our understanding of Him does. As we draw nearer, He seems larger. And isn’t that what we need? A big  view of God? Don’t we have big  challenges, big  worries, big  questions?\nOf course we do. So we need a big view of God. ',

      "text": 'Growing in Grace Take a look through a magnifying glass. What does it do? It brings the object closer and makes it look bigger so you can see it more clearly. That’s what worshiping God does—God is brought closer and you can see Him more clearly.'
