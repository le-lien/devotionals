    "body": 'Watch a small boy follow his dad through the snow. He stretches to step where his dad stepped. Not an easy task. His small legs extend as far as they can so his feet can fall in his father’s prints.\nThe father, seeing what the son is doing, smiles and begins taking shorter steps, so the son can follow.\nIt’s a picture of discipleship.\nIn our faith we follow in someone’s steps. A parent, a teacher, a hero—\nnone of us are the first to walk the trail. All of us have someone we follow.\nIn our faith we leave footprints to guide others. A child, a friend, a recent convert. None should be left to walk the trail alone.\nIt’s the principle of discipleship. ',
