    "body": 'If grains of sand measured your heavenly and earthly lives, how would they stack up? Heaven would be every grain of sand on every beach on earth, plus more. Earthly life would be one hundredth of one grain of sand. Need a phrase to summarize the length of your life on earth? Try: “Just a moment.”\nWasn’t this the phrase of choice for Paul? “For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all” (2\nCorinthians 4:17 NIV). The apostle had been “beaten times without number, often in danger of death.” He writes, “Five times I received from the Jews thirty-nine lashes. Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, a night and a day I have spent in the deep” (2\nCorinthians 11:23–25 NASB). These, in Paul’s words, are light troubles to be endured for just a moment.\nWhat if we took the same attitude toward life? What if we saw our tough times as a grain of sand and saw heaven as endless beaches? ',
