    "body": 'here is no such thing as purifying the impure. Evil things never get purer, but more vile. All impurity, all evil must be T cast out. You can never make Satan holy. He will be hellish and fiendish forever, and when the brightness of God comes, the Devil will be glad to get in the pit and stay there forever and ever.\n\nSome foolish people say that the Devil will be saved, and that they will go arm in arm with him. It is because they do not rightly understand the Word of God. You will never purify sin. “The carnal mind…is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can be”  (Rom. 8:7). Carnality has to be destroyed. Evil propensities must be rooted out. God‘s plan is, "I will give you a pure heart and a right spirit." And this is the order of the new creation in God.\n\nIt does not matter what you say; if your human spirit does not get wholly sanctified, you will always be in danger. It is that position where the Devil has a chance to work upon you. Therefore, we are taught to come into sanctification where uncleanness and corruption pass away, and where all kinds of lusts lose their power.\n\nOnly in the pursuit of sanctification does God bless us in our purifying state so that we ascend with Him in the glory. The saints of God, as they go on into perfection and holiness and understand the mind of the Spirit and the law of the spirit of life, are brought into a very blessed place.\n\nIt is the place of holiness, the place of entire sanctification, the place where God reigns on the throne of the heart. It is the place where the mind is so concentrated in the power of God that a person thinks about the things that are pure and lives in holy ascendancy. The Spirit can sanctify your spirit until you will never vaunt yourself and will never say "I, I, I," but it will be "Christ, Christ, Christ." Then Christ will be glorified.',
