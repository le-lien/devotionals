Through the Red Sea onto dry ground (Exodus 14:22), through the wilderness (Deuteronomy 29:5), through the valley of the shadow of death (Psalm 23:4), and through the deep sea (Psalm 77:19).\nIn fact, through is one of God’s favorite words: “When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow you. When you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned, nor shall the flame scorch you” (Isaiah 43:2).\nWhat are you trying to get through today? Trouble with your parents? A friendship that’s fading? A class you’re failing? Whatever you’re up against, God has already been through it, and he’ll walk through it with you. The journey may not be easy. It may not be quick. But God promises to be at your side, lighting the way for each step. “Your word is a lamp to guide my feet and a light for my path” (Psalm 119:105 NLT). ',

      "text": 'Ever taken a long walk alone at night—without a light? It can be a little creepy and scary—and sometimes a lot creepy and scary! Kind of like walking through life without the light of God to show you the way. So read the Bible and talk to him daily. You’ll find it a much better way to travel.'
