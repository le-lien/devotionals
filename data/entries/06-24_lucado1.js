A glance into hell leads the believer to rejoice. But it also leads the believer to redouble his efforts to reach the lost.\nTo understand hell is to pray more earnestly and to serve more diligently.\nOurs is a high-stakes mission.\nAnd the lost? What is the meaning of this message for the unprepared?\nHeed the warnings and get ready. This plane won’t fly forever. “Death is the destiny of every man; the living should take this to heart” (Eccles. 7:2\nNIV). ',
