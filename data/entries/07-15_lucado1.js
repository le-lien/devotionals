Faith sees Canaan.\nYour eyes see your faults. Your faith sees your Savior.\nYour eyes see your guilt. Your faith sees his blood.\nYour eyes look in the mirror and see a sinner, a failure, a promise-breaker. But by faith you look in the mirror and see a robed prodigal bearing the ring of grace on your finger and the kiss of your Father on your face. ',
