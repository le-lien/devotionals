Don’t you think a holy God will take care of His children too?\nThe writer of Hebrews prayed that “the God of peace will give you every good thing you need so that you can do what he wants” (13:20). If you think about it, you’ll see that prayer has already been answered in your life.\nYou may not always have a feast of all your favorite desserts, but don’t you always at least have bread to eat? You may not have everything you want, but don’t you have everything you truly need? And many times, there is  a feast. ',

      "text": 'Growing in Grace It’s easy to forget our blessings sometimes—home, family, friends, clothes, food, books, and toys. Most of us have far more than we really need. Could you share some of your blessings? Gather up some of your clothes, books, and toys to share with needy children at a shelter.'
