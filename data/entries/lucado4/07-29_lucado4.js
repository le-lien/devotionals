After all, He chased the butterflies out of the stomachs of His nervous disciples.\nWe need to remember that the disciples were ordinary men given an extraordinary task. Long before they were pictured in the stained-glass windows of our churches, they were trying to make a living and raise a family. They didn’t come from a long line of priests, and they weren’t superheroes. But they loved Jesus more than they were afraid, and because of that, they did some extraordinary things.\nWhen you choose to follow Jesus, He will take care of your earthly fears.\nHe will help you to be brave. Remember, Jesus gave courage and strength to His disciples, and He’ll give it to you too. ',
