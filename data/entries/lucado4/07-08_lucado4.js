    "body": 'Imagine you are in Bible times. You have traveled back in time to talk to a man on death row. He is Jewish by birth. A tentmaker. An apostle of Christ. His name is Paul, and his days are numbered. You wonder what it is that keeps this man going as he nears his death. So you ask him some questions.\nDo you have family, Paul? I have none.\nHow is your health? My body has been beaten, and I am tired.\nHave you gotten any awards? Not on earth.\nThen what do you have, Paul? No awards. No family. What do you have that matters? I have my faith in Jesus. It’s all I have. But it’s all I need. I have kept the faith.\nThen Paul leans back against the wall of his cell and smiles. Paul smiles because he knows God’s promise: “If you are faithful, I will give you the crown of life” (Revelation 2:10). ',
