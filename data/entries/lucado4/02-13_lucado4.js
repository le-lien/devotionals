David didn’t start out as a king—he was a shepherd and the youngest in his family. Samuel was just a boy when the Lord first spoke to him.\nJesus doesn’t set an age limit on His workers. He never says, “When you’re all grown up, come and follow Me.” He says, “Follow me”\n(Matthew 9:9).\nGod has a plan for each and every day of your life—including this day.\nAsk Him to show you what it is. Take a chance. Dare to be different. Make a new friend. Try out for the team. Lead a song in Bible class. Run for class president. Volunteer to help. Sure, it could be risky. You might get laughed at. Or you might just make a difference! ',
