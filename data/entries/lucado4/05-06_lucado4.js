But God is in complete  control, and He has an amazing way of using Satan’s evil plans to do good. Satan thought he had won when Jesus died on the cross. But God raised Jesus from the dead and gave the gift of salvation to His people.\nMany Christians in the early church were thrown in prison or killed.\nMany others left their homes and ran away to other lands. But God used those hard times to spread His word to other countries. Sad things and even bad things happen to all people—to those who believe in God and those who don’t. But God has a special promise for His children: “In everything God works for the good of those who love him” (Romans 8:28).\nWhen you see sad things or even bad things in your life, when it seems like Satan is winning, remember that God will somehow use those things for good. Because God is in charge. ',
