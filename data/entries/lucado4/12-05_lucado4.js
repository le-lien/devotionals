He’s thinking, I want you to know My Son. We dream of raising our high scores. He dreams of raising us up to heaven. We do everything to avoid hard times. God uses hard times to make our faith stronger. We say, “I want to have it all.” God says, “My Son gave it all.”\nWe love earthly things that rust and break. God loves heavenly things that last forever. We are overjoyed by our victories. He is overjoyed by our confessions.\nWe look at the Nike star player with the million-dollar smile and say, “I want to be like him.” God points to His Son—who suffered the cross to save you—and says, “I want you to be like Him.” ',
