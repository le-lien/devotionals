They didn’t expect anything in return.\nAfter all, what could Jesus give them? What could a dead man offer them?\nThese two women weren’t going to Jesus’ tomb to get  anything; they were going to give. They were going because they wanted to serve Him . . .\nbecause they loved Him.\nThere is no greater reason.\nAt the tomb that day, Mary and Mary Magdalene were acting out of love the greatest service of all. It is what we are called to do as Jesus’\ndisciples. It is truly following Him. ',

Everyone—young and old—is part of the church. And every person has an important job to do (1 Corinthians 12:12– 26).'
