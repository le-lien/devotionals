    "body": 'When we see Jesus, what will we see? We will see the perfect Priest.\nIn Bible times, a priest was the one who presented people to God and God to people. Revelation says that, in heaven, Jesus “was dressed in a long robe. He had a gold band around his chest” (1:13). That is the type of robe and gold band that only priests used to wear. Jesus was wearing the clothing of a priest.\nYou have known other priests. They may or may not have been church leaders, but they were all people who wanted to bring you to God. But even these people needed a priest. These people, like you, were sinful. But not Jesus. “Jesus is the kind of high priest that we need. He is holy; he has no sin in him. He is pure and not influenced by sinners. And he is raised above the heavens” (Hebrews 7:26).\nJesus is the perfect Priest. ',
