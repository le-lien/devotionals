    "body": 'There are those who say hell is not real. That a loving God just wouldn’t send anyone there. But let’s think about that. If you take punishment out of the Bible, then you also take away God’s justice. It’s as if you’re saying that God doesn’t care if people lie or steal or murder. And that He doesn’t care about those who have been hurt by the liars, thieves, and murderers. But God says, “I am the One who punishes” (Romans 12:19).\nAnd think about this: if everyone gets into heaven, then why did God send Jesus to wash away our sins? Jesus Himself said, “The only way to the Father is through me” (John 14:6).\nIf we say there is no punishment for those who refuse to follow Jesus, then we are saying that the Bible is a lie. Because over and over the Bible tells us that some will be lost and some will saved (for example, Matthew 25:33). Punishment for our sins is real. We must  choose to follow Jesus to be saved. ',
