He wants you to be just like Jesus.\nGod cannot love you any more than He already does. If you think God would love you more if you never messed up, you’re wrong. If you think He would love you more if you never had any bad thoughts, you’re wrong.\nIf you think He would love you more if you made straight As … if you were taller, shorter, faster, smarter … you’re wrong.\nDon’t think God’s love is like the love of people. Some people may love you more if you are good or love you less if you mess up. But not God. He loves you just the way you are. And because He loves you, He is still working on you. He wants to make you better. He wants you to be just like Jesus. ',
