    "body": 'Jesus had a definition for greed. He called it “measuring who you are by what you have.” In other words, a person’s worth is equal to the person’s purse. 1. You have a lot. = You are a lot. 2. You have a little. = You are a little.\nThe result of this kind of thinking is easy to guess: If you are what you own, then by all means own it all! No price is too high. No payment is too much. Go ahead, gossip to be popular. Lie to get the new shoes. Steal to get the new game. If you have  more, then you’ll be  more—more important, more popular, more happy. Right?\nNo. Not  right. Greed costs a lot—and not just a lot of money. Gossip will cost you friendships. Lies and stealing will cost you the trust of your family.\nAnd all of those things will pull you away from God.\nWhen you believe that you are what you own, you actually lose the things that are truly important—friends, family, and faith. And nothing is worth that. ',
