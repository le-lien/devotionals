He knows that seed grows better if the land is prepared.\nConfession does for your soul what preparing the land does for the field.\nConfession  is when you invite God to walk through your heart to make it ready for planting His fruit.\nYour confession to God might sound something like this: “There is a big rock of selfishness over here, Father. I can’t budge it. And over there is a stump of jealousy. Its roots are long and deep. And may I show you this soil that’s too dry and crusty for seeds.” God’s seed grows better if the soil of the heart is cleared.\nAnd so the Father and the Son walk the field of your heart together. They dig and pull, preparing your heart for God’s holy fruit. Confession invites God to plant His love and grace in your heart. ',
