    "body": 'Wow! What an incredible sentence! God will give everyone the praise he should get.\nGod won’t just praise “the best of them” or just “a few of them.” God will praise everyone!\nYou won’t be left out. God will see to that. In fact, God Himself will give the praise. When it comes to giving out praise, God doesn’t give the job to someone else. Gabriel doesn’t speak for God. Michael doesn’t hand out the crowns. God Himself does the job. God Himself will praise His children.\nAnd what’s more, His praise is personal! Awards aren’t given for a whole nation at a time, a church at a time, or a family at a time. The crowns of praise are given out one at a time. God Himself will look you in the eye and bless you with the words, “You did well. You are a good servant” (Matthew 25:23).\nNothing could be more amazing than that! ',
