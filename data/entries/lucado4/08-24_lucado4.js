But when it comes to choosing who  you want to be, there are only two choices: you can either be a person of the world or a person of God.\nA person of the world thinks, What do  I want to do?  But a person of God thinks, What does  God want me to do?  See the difference?\nA person of the world is selfish, bragging, and always demanding his or her own way. But a person of God tries to obey these words from Philippians 2:3: “Do not let selfishness or pride be your guide. Be humble and give more honor to others than to yourselves.” ',
