    "body": 'In my closet hangs a sweater that I never wear. It is too small. I should throw that sweater away. But love  won’t let me.\nMy mom made it for me. Each stitch shows her love for me. Each strand was chosen with care. Each thread was picked with affection. It is special not because of what it is, but because of who made it.\nThat must have been what the writer of Psalm 139 was thinking when he wrote, “You knit me together in my mother’s womb” (v. 13 NIV).\nThink about those words. You were knit together by God. You aren’t an accident. You weren’t made on some galactic assembly line. You aren’t just another kid.\nYou were deliberately planned, specially gifted, and lovingly placed on this earth by God. In a world that decides your worth by the clothes you wear or the sports you play, let me tell you something—you are valuable because God created you. ',
