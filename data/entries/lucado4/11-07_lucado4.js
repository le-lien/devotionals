No matter where we are, God sees each of us—from the backwoods of Virginia to the business district of London, England. No matter who we are, He sees us—from the Vikings to the astronauts, and from the cave dwellers to the kings. He sees those who live in huts and those who live in mansions. Whether we were born in Bible times or modern times, God saw each of us before  we were ever born.\nAnd He loves what He sees. Heart filled with emotion and overcome by pride, the Maker of the stars turns to us, one by one, and says, “You are My child. I love you dearly. I know that someday you’ll disobey Me, turn your back on Me, and walk away. But I want you to know, I’ve already given you a way to come back.” ',

You can only remember one or two lines behind you (the past). But God holds the whole yardstick of time. He sees all peoples and all times—all at the same time. Amazing!'
