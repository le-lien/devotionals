Not just then.\nEverybody loves you then.\nBut how will God feel about you when you snap at everyone around you?\nWhen you have hateful thoughts? When you sass your parents? How does God feel about you then?\nCan anything separate you from the love Jesus has for you?\nGod answered that question long before you even asked it. He answered it by lighting up the sky with a star. He answered it by waking the shepherds with the song of angels. He answered it by sending His one and only Son to be born in a stable in Bethlehem—to save you.\nBy sending Jesus to live and die on earth, God said to all people, “You’re something special. Nothing can keep Me from loving you.” ',
