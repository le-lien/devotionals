He told us there would be troubles.\nJust as Dorothy faced dark forests, twisted roads, and wicked witches on her way to Oz, so we will have troubles on our way to heaven. We will be sick. Our hearts might get broken. People we love will die, and wars will be fought. We should not be surprised by these things, because the devil lives in this world. But just because the devil swoops in like the wicked witch and laughs his evil laugh, we shouldn’t panic.\nJesus said, “It is finished” (John 19:30). The battle is over. Keep on the lookout for the devil’s tricks, but don’t be alarmed. Jesus has already written this book, and He wins in the end. Satan may still play his evil tricks, but only for a little while. Just a few more twists and turns in the yellow brick road, and his story will end. ',
