    "body": 'Think of it this way. Sin put you in a prison. Sin locked you behind the bars of guilt and shame and lies and fear. Sin did nothing but chain you to a wall of misery. Then Jesus came and paid your bail to get you out of prison. He served your time. He took your punishment and set you free.\nJesus died, and when you choose to believe in Him, your old sinful self will die too. You will be made new—and free.\nBut the only way to be set free from the prison of sin is to pay the price.\nIn this case, the price is death. Someone has to die—either you or a heavensent substitute. You cannot leave prison until there is a death. But that death happened on the cross. And when Jesus died, sin lost its hold on you. You are free. ',
