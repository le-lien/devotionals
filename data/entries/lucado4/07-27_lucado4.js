    "body": 'One of Jesus’ greatest skills was His ability to stay on target, to stay focused. His life never got distracted or off track. He kept His life headed in the right direction.\nAs Jesus looked out at His future, He could see many choices. He could have chased after any one of them, and He could have been a success at any one of them. He could have been a warrior and fought the Romans to free the Jewish people. He could have been happy as a teacher in the temple and educated the people. But in the end He chose to be a Savior and save souls.\nAnyone who was with Him for any length of time heard it from Jesus Himself: “The Son of Man came to find lost people and save them” (Luke 19:10). The heart of Jesus was focused on just one thing. The day He left the carpentry shop of Nazareth He had one goal—the cross. ',
