You’d end up crawling with a bloated belly from one ice-cream store to the next.\nCan you imagine the mess there would be if God gave us everything we asked for?\n“God did not choose  us to suffer his anger, but to have salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ” (1 Thessalonians 5:9).\nIn this verse, what does it say God chooses for your life? Salvation.\nGod’s greatest want is that you reach heaven. His plan includes stops that will help you on your journey to heaven. He frowns on stops that slow you down. When His perfect plan and your earthly plan crash together, a choice must be made. Who’s in charge of this journey? You or God?\nIt’s God. And I’m glad He chose heaven for us all. ',
