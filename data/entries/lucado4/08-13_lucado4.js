He doesn’t need to hear it—He already knows. But He also knows you need to say it.\nWhether you think it’s too small to be mentioned or too big to be forgiven doesn’t matter. It’s not your decision. Your job is to be honest with God.\nAre there any worries in my heart that I haven’t given to God?\n“Give all your worries to him, because he cares for you” (1 Peter 5:7).\nThe German word for worry  means “to strangle.” The Greek word means\n“to divide the mind.” Both are right. Worry is like a noose around your neck that won’t let you breathe. Worry confuses your mind. Neither of these things will lead you to the joy God wants you to have. ',
