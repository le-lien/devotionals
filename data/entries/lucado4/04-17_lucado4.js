So you try to fill your account by doing as many good things as you can.\nMaybe you say something nice to a friend, or help your neighbor rake up leaves, or help out in the church nursery. Maybe you lead prayers or memorize Bible verses. Surely doing more good things will earn you some extra holiness, right? That should fill up your holiness account, right?\nWrong. When it comes to goodness, you can never do enough. You can never earn enough holiness. To get to heaven, God demands that your holiness account be full—and you just can’t do that on your own. So how do  you get to heaven? Jesus.\nWhen you choose to believe in Jesus and to obey Him, He fills up your holiness account for you. It’s called grace—and it’s His gift to you. ',
