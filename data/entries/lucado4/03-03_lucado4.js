    "body": 'Jesus said, “When you pray, you should pray like this: ‘Our Father in heaven, we pray that your name will always be kept holy. We pray that your kingdom will come’ ” (Matthew 6:9–10).\nWhen you say, “We pray that your kingdom will come,” you are inviting God Himself to walk into your world. You are asking Him to be the Lord of your life—your entire life. You are saying that you want His will to rule in your heart. That you want everything you say and do to be pleasing to Him.\nThat you want Him to guide your relationships with your family and friends. And you want Him to take charge of your doubts and fears.\nThis is no small prayer. You are boldly and bravely asking God to come into every corner of your life.\nAnd who are you to ask such a thing? Who are you to ask God to take control of your world? You are His child! ',
