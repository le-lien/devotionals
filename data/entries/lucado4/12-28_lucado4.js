Sometimes we get so caught up in thinking about how bad  we have been, that we forget how good  God is.\nOf all the wonders of God’s creation, I think the snowflake is one of the best. Think about it. Is there anything purer or cleaner than a snowflake that’s come straight down from the heavens?\nNow listen to God’s promises in Psalm 51:7: “Take away my sin, and I will be clean. Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.”\nThat’s right. God promises to wash away all your sins and to make you as pure and clean as that snowflake that’s come straight down from heaven.\nForgiveness is His gift to you—you just have to accept it.\nAnd the more you accept God’s forgiveness, the more likely you are to forgive others.
