They all have the same goal: “I will get what I want even if it hurts you.”\nAnd they all have the same end: uselessness. It’s useless. Absolute power is not possible. When you make it to the top—if there even is a top—the only way left to go is down. And the fall is often painful.\nA thousand years from now, will it matter what the world thought of you? Will it matter if you went first or not? No, but it will make a difference what God thought of you. And that’s what really matters. ',
