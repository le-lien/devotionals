It’s good to have some rules for the other parts of your life too.\nHere are some God-given, time-tested rules for life that will make all your days go much more smoothly:\n• Love God more than anything else.\n• Live like someone is watching even when no one is.\n• Do your best, at home and away from home.\n• Obey your parents.\n• Be kind and respectful to everyone.\n• Don’t spend money that you don’t have yet.\n• Pray twice as much as you think you need to.\n• Forgive yourself because God has forgiven you.\n• Remember that God always loves you … always.
