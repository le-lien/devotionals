Maybe a friend has betrayed you. Or maybe a friend has recently moved away.\nA troubled friendship can leave you feeling empty and hurt inside. Jesus understands. After all, Judas was His friend, and Judas betrayed Him. Peter was His friend, and Peter said he didn’t even know Him. John was His friend, and he ran away when Jesus was arrested.\nFriends aren’t always faithful, but God is. So the next time a troubled friendship leaves you hurt, ask God to comfort you. Ask Him to fill that emptiness with His peace. And then pray for your friend—God can touch the heart of your friend too. ',

Do not be angry with each other, but forgive each other. If someone does wrong to you, then forgive him” (Colossians 3:12–13).'
