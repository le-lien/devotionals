And though it may sound simple, it isn’t always easy to do.\nWhat does having unity mean?\nIt means thinking about what others want and need—not just what you want and need.\nIt means that when someone makes you angry, you choose to let that anger go.\nIt means that when someone hurts your feelings, you don’t hurt them back.\nIt means forgiving when you don’t want to.\nIt means being kind when you would rather not.\nIt means being patient when you want to be mad.\nUnity means sticking together when the selfish ways of this world want to pull you apart. Doesn’t unity sound like one of God’s great ideas? ',

Maybe you all share the same house, or you all like peanut butter and chocolate ice cream. And you are all God’s children!'
