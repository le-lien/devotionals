    "body": 'Just as you want to know that your parents are safe while you’re at school, so we all want to know what happens to those we love when they die. We want to know: When we die, do our souls go straight to heaven to be with God?  Can that be true? Do we dare to believe it? According to the Bible, it is  true and we can  believe it.\nThe Bible doesn’t have a lot to say about the time between a person’s physical death and being raised to live with God. It doesn’t shout out its answers. It whispers them. And at the place where all those whispers come together, we can hear God’s voice.\nGod tells us that, at death, the Christian joins Him in an instant. One moment he is on earth, and the next he is face-to-face with the Father and with those who have died earlier. And it all happens in the blink of an eye. ',
