    "body": 'One night during family devotions, I set an empty plate in front of each of my daughters. In the center of the table, I placed a collection of fruit, raw vegetables, and Oreo cookies. “Every day,” I explained, “God prepares for us a plate of experiences. What kind of plate do you most enjoy?”\nThe answer was easy. Sarah put three cookies on her plate. Some days are like that, aren’t they? Some days are “three-cookie days.” But many are not. Sometimes our plate has nothing but vegetables—twenty-four hours of celery, carrots, and squash. God knows we need to build up our muscles. It may be hard to swallow, but isn’t it for our own good? Most days, however, have a little bit of everything.\nThe next time your plate—er, day—has more “broccoli” than “Oreos,”\nremember who made it. And if you’re finding it all a little hard to swallow, talk to God about it. Jesus did. ',
