    "body": 'The storm at sea was terrible. The wind howled. The waves beat against the boat. And the disciples battled for their lives. They were already frightened. So when they saw Jesus walking toward them on the water, they called him a ghost. A phantom. To them, the glow was anything but God.\nWhen we see gentle lights in the middle of the stormy parts of life, we often think the same thing. We see the kindness, the helping hand, the answer. But we think they are just an accident, a chance happening, or good luck. We think they are anything but God.\nBut God doesn’t burst into the room with ten thousand angels to help you. When you’re in the middle of a bad day or a bad problem, He uses the people around you to help. That friendly hug, that offer to help, that unexpected answer just when you needed it—they aren’t accidents. They are God. He is closer than you think. ',

      "text": 'The prophet Elijah looked for God in the mighty wind, the earthquake, and the fire. But God was not in any of these. At last came a “quiet, gentle voice,” and this was God (1 Kings 19:11–13). You can hear God’s quiet, gentle voice too—in a sunrise, a kind word, a helping hand.'
