He always listened closely to His Father so that He never missed a heavenly whisper. His mercy was so great He never missed a chance to forgive. No lie came from His lips; no sin clouded His eyes. He helped when others turned away. He kept going when others quit.\nJesus is the perfect example for how every person should live. God urges you to keep your eyes upon Jesus. Focus your heart on Him, and make Him the center of your life. ',
