    "body": 'Ilike the story about the fellow who went to the pet store to buy a singing parakeet. The man lived alone, and his house was too quiet. The store owner said he had just the bird for him, so the man bought it.\nThe next day the man came home from work to a house full of music. He went to feed the bird and saw for the first time that it had only one leg. He felt cheated that he’d been sold a one-legged bird, so he called the store and complained.\n“What do you want,” the store owner asked, “a bird that can sing or a bird that can dance?”\nGood question. God always answers our prayers. But sometimes it’s not the answer we expect—like the man’s one-legged bird. And we’re disappointed. When that happens, we have to ask ourselves: What do we really want?  Remember, God only wants the very best for you. So if His answer is not what you expect, maybe you need to change  what you expect. ',

      "text": 'Disappointments can be as bitter as lemons. Ask a grown-up to help you make homemade lemonade. Sample the lemon first. Sour, hmmm? Then taste the lemonade. Much better! When you add the sweetness of God (sugar) to your disappointments (lemons), they can turn out to be blessings (lemonade).'
