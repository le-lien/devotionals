    "body": 'Corrie ten Boom was a Dutch Christian who, along with her family, helped Jews escape the Nazis. She used to say, “When the train goes through a tunnel and the world gets dark, do you jump out? Of course not.\nYou sit still and trust the engineer to get you through.”\nWe need to hear that God is still in control. We need to hear that it’s not over until He says so. We need to hear that life’s troubles and trials are not a reason to jump off the train. They are a reason to sit still and trust the Great Engineer to get us through.\nWhat do you do when you’re feeling sad and alone? What do you do when you’re facing a tough time? Go back and read the story of God. Read His Word again and again. Let God remind you that you aren’t the first person to be sad or to need help. Let God remind you of how He helps His children.\nRead the story of God and remember that its message is for you! ',
