    "body": 'We learn God’s will for our lives by spending time with Him. The key to knowing God’s heart is having a relationship with Him. A personal  relationship. God will speak to you differently than He will speak to others.\nJust because God spoke to Moses through a burning bush doesn’t mean we should all sit next to a bush waiting for God to speak. God used a fish to get Jonah’s attention. Does that mean we should have worship services at Sea World? No. God reveals His heart personally—in a different way—to each person.\nThat is why the time you spend with God is so important. You can’t know His heart just by having a quick chat once in a while or a weekly visit. You learn God’s will as you spend time with Him every single day.\nHang out with God long enough, and you will come to know His heart. ',
