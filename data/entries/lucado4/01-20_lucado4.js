Because the sin that is in the world all around you can sometimes cause you to sin.\nIf someone pushes you, you might push back. Hearing other people grumble can lead you to grumble. Listening to the terrible stories on the news can make you worry. The selfishness in others can make you be selfish instead of sharing. It can make you walk away instead of stopping to help.\nBecause of sin, you’ve snapped at your best friend, argued with your brother or sister, and sassed your mom and dad. Sin breaks promises and breaks hearts. But in heaven all of this will end.\nCan you imagine a world without sin? If so, then you can imagine heaven. ',
