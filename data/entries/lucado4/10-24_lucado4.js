They know what heaven holds.\nHeaven is filled with those people who let God change them. In heaven, all fighting will stop because jealousy won’t exist. Gossips won’t gather because there will be no secrets. Every sin is gone. Every fear is forgotten.\nEvery worry is past.\nHeaven is like pure wheat. No weeds. Pure gold. No other metals. Pure love. No selfishness. Pure hope. No fear. It’s no surprise that the angels rejoice when one sinner repents. They know that one more Christian will join the wonders of heaven. They know what heaven holds.
