Doesn’t it sometimes seem like there isn’t enough food to feed all the hungry people? Like there aren’t enough doctors to take care of all the sick?\nLike there aren’t enough people to tell the world about Jesus?\nSo what do we do? Throw up our hands and walk away? Tell the world we can’t help them?\nNo! We don’t give up. We look up—to God. We trust Him. We believe Him when He says He will use our hands to do His work. Galatians 6:9\nsays, “We must not become tired of doing good. We will receive our harvest of eternal life [heaven] at the right time. We must not give up!” ',
