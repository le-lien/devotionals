When you are worried about the things you need, talk to Jehovah-jireh, the Lord who provides. Do your troubles seem too large?\nSeek the help of Jehovah-shalom, the Lord is peace. Is your body sick? Is your heart hurting? Jehovah-rophe, the Lord who heals you, will see you now. Do you feel like a soldier stuck behind enemy lines? Keep your eyes on Jehovah-nissi, the Lord is the flag that I follow.\nThinking about the names of God reminds you of the character of God.\nTake these names and hide them in your heart.\nGod is … the shepherd  who guides, the Lord  who provides, the voice who brings peace in the storm, the physician  who heals the sick, and the flag  that the soldier follows.

Just as each of your names tells something different about who you are and what you do, so God’s names tell all the different things He does for you.'
