    "body": 'Think about the earth. Scientists believe that the earth weighs about six sextillion tons. That’s a six with twenty-one zeros  after it!\nThe earth is tilted exactly twenty-one degrees. If it were tilted any more or less, the North and South Poles would melt and our seasons would change dramatically. And even though the earth spins at the rate of one thousand miles per hour, not one of us tumbles off into outer space!\nAs you look up at the sky, think about these questions: If God can place the stars and hold up the sky like a curtain, do you think He can lead you through your life? If God is mighty enough to set the sun on fire, could it be that He is mighty enough to light your path? If He cares enough about Saturn to give it rings or Venus to make it sparkle, do you think He cares enough about you to meet all your needs? Yes! ',

      "text": 'The God who placed and named each star (Psalm 147:4) is watching over you. As a reminder, cut star shapes from heavy paper and add some glitter. Hang them from pieces of string (six to twelve inches long) over your bed. Watch the stars twinkle and sway as you go to sleep, and thank God for watching over you.'
