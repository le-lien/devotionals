Come and see the changed lives: the sad who now have joy; the angry who are now at peace; the shamed who have been forgiven; the hurts that have been healed; the orphans who are hugged; and the prisoners who have been given hope.\nCome and see the pierced hand of Jesus. Watch as He touches the most ordinary heart, wipes the tear from the dirtiest face, and forgives the ugliest sin.\nCome and see. He welcomes everyone who looks for Him. He ignores no one. He fears no question. Come and see Jesus. ',
