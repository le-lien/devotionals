The bully in gym class, the mean girl, sickness, sadness, tiredness, loneliness—and all those other “ness-es” that make such messes in our lives.\nIf Paul’s question were only “Who can be against us?” we could list our enemies. It would be much easier for us to simply list them than to fight them. But that is not the question. The question is, “If God is for us, who can be against us?”\nGod is  for you. A bully may have picked on you, your teachers may have overlooked you, your brothers and sisters may not speak to you, but within earshot of your prayers is the One who made the oceans—God! He is for you, and He fights for you! ',
