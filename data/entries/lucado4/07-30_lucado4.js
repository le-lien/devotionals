    "body": 'Jesus tells us to do two things. First, “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul and mind.” And, second, “Love your neighbor as you love yourself” (Matthew 22:37–39).\nLet’s take a look at that second command: “Love your neighbor as you love yourself.” Who is your neighbor? Well, Jesus answered that in Matthew 22: your neighbor is everyone around you. That’s the part of the verse that most people talk about. But they don’t usually talk about the second part of that verse: “as you love yourself.” Jesus said that you are supposed to love yourself.\nNow, Jesus wasn’t talking about an “I’m-better-than-you” kind of love.\nHe’s talking about loving yourself because you are an amazing creation of God.\nThe simple fact is that you have to love yourself and know how you want to be treated before  you can know how to love your neighbor. And when you don’t love yourself, it becomes easier for others to be unkind to you.\nSo, love your neighbor … as you love yourself. ',
