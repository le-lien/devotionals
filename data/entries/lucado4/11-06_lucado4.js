    "body": 'Have you ever watched one of those old western movies where the bounty hunter chases after the bad guy? Ever notice how the bounty hunter always travels alone? It’s not hard to see why. Who wants to hang out with a guy who gets even for a living? Who wants to risk getting on his bad side?\nMore than once I’ve seen a person so angry—and so eager to get even—\nthat he was about to explode. The whole time I was thinking, I hope I never get on his bad list. Grouchy folks, these bounty hunters. Best leave them alone—you never know when they might lose their temper!\nIf you’re out to get even, you’ll never rest. How can you? For one thing, your enemy may never pay up. As much as you think he owes you an apology, he may never give you one. No matter how right you are, you may never get a penny’s worth of justice. And if you do, will it be enough? Best to just forgive and let God take care of the rest. ',
