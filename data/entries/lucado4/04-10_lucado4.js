It seems that everywhere Jesus went, great crowds of people came to Him, wanting His help.\nSurely there must have been times when He was tired, when He just wanted to rest. Why didn’t He simply turn them away and tell them to come back tomorrow? Why didn’t He take a day off now and then? Why?\nCould it be that Jesus’ heart hurt for those people? Could it be that His heart was—and is—broken for all people who have ever stared up at the heavens and cried out in prayer, “Why is this happening to me?”\nImagine Jesus today: He is leaning over, bending down close to someone who is hurt. He’s listening. His eyes fill with tears as He hears that person’s troubles. Then His hand gently brushes away a tear. He was hurt once too.\nHe understands. ',
