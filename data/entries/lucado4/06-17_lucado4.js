And it can be just plain loud.\nThe louder it gets, the more desperate we become.\nSome of you are thinking, You don’t have any idea how hard my life is.\nHomework. Tryouts. Bullies. Fighting parents. You’re right. I don’t know how tough your life is right now. But I have a very clear idea of how miserable your future will be if you don’t deal with your anger.\nAnger is like a dark thundercloud: black, threatening, and terrible. It’s like a storm in your heart that is threatening to turn into a tornado. You can’t change what other people do, but you can change how you act toward them. You can’t always help being angry, but you can control what you do with your anger. Ask God to help you—because He will. ',

      "text": 'There will always be things—and people—that make you angry. Like the bully who always picks on you, piles of homework, or being laughed at. Being angry is okay, but sinning is not. Avoid sin by deciding now what you will do the next time something makes you angry.'
