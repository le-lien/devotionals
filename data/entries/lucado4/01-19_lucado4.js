    "body": 'David wasn’t a perfect man, but he did try his best to do the things that would please God. That is why David was called a man after God’s own heart (Acts 13:22 NKJV). In Psalm 27:4, David said, “I ask only one thing from the Lord… . Let me live in the Lord’s house all my life.”\nWhat is this “Lord’s house” that David is talking about? Is David talking about a real house? Is he wishing for a building with four walls and a door to come and go through? No. The Bible says that God “does not live in temples that men build” (Acts 17:24).\nWhen David says, “I will live in the house of the Lord forever” (Psalm 23:6), he’s not talking about a house like the one you live in. David is saying that he wants to live in the presence of God, wherever he goes.\nThe wonderful news is that when you love Jesus, He promises to be with you wherever you go! ',
