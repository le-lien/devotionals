Look at what He said about His family: “My true brother and sister and mother are those who do the things God wants”\n(Mark 3:35).\nWhen Jesus’ brothers didn’t share His beliefs, He didn’t try to force them (John 7:1–9). He knew that His spiritual family could provide Him with what His own family didn’t.\nMaybe you don’t have the perfect family. Or maybe your family is usually pretty great, but you need a little extra encouragement. Where do you go? God has an answer for that—your church family. They are your brothers and sisters in Christ. Turn to them when you need a little extra care and encouragement, when you need a hug or someone to simply listen.\nLet God’s family give you what you need. That’s why God gave them to you. And remember, even if your family isn’t the dream family, don’t lose heart. God can change families. ',
