As time goes by, we need more and more anger and hate to keep our blood pumping faster.\nThere is a dangerous point at which anger stops being an emotion and becomes the reason we do what we do—and what we do is usually the wrong thing. A person who only cares about getting even moves further and further away from being able to forgive. And that moves him further and further away from God.\nHatred is like a rabid dog that turns and bites its owner.\nRevenge is like a raging fire that burns up the one who set it.\nAnger is like a trap that catches the hunter.\nAnd mercy is the choice that can set them all free.
