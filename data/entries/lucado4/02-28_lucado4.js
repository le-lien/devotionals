    "body": 'There are people who live only to make themselves happy. And because they have never seen God in person, they believe there is no life except the here and now. To them, nothing is real except what they can see.\nNothing is important except their own happiness, and there is no Creator and no heaven.\nThese people say, “Who cares? I may be bad, but so what? What I do is my own business.” They are more concerned with having fun than knowing the Father. They are so busy chasing after good times that they have no time for God.\nAre they right? Is it okay to spend our days ignoring God and thinking only of ourselves? Absolutely not!\nPaul told us in Romans 1 that when we ignore God, we lose more than church on Sundays. We lose the very reason we were created. ',

      "text": 'Many people don’t believe that God is real or that He cares. It can be tough to share God’s Word with them. But one thing they can’t ignore is the way you live. Live like Jesus did—loving others more than yourself. Then God’s message will come through loud and clear. March Depend on the Lord. Trust him, and he will take care of you. —PSALM 37:5'
