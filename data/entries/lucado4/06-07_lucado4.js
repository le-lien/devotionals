Maybe you’ve had to move or had friends who moved away. Maybe those around you don’t understand your faith. Maybe you’ve even lost someone you love. Some days the hurts seem to outnumber the hugs.\nThose days can leave you feeling tired and all alone. They can make you just want to give up. But don’t.\nWhen you’re having a tough day, God can seem far away, and getting to Him can seem like an impossible journey. But it isn’t. Let me cheer you on and give you hope. God never said the journey would always be easy. But He did say that if you trust in Him, He will get you home to heaven. ',
