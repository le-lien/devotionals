    "body": 'Thankfully, God’s faithfulness to us has never depended on our faithfulness to Him. He is faithful even when we aren’t. He keeps His promises even when we don’t keep ours. When we have lost all courage, He has not. He’s made a habit of using people even when we don’t think He can.\nNeed an example? The feeding of the five thousand. It’s the only miracle except those from Jesus’ final week—that is written about in all four Gospels. Why did all four writers think it was worth telling? Maybe they wanted to show us how God doesn’t give up even when His people do.\nWhen the disciples didn’t pray, Jesus prayed. When the disciples were weak, Jesus was strong. When the disciples had no faith, Jesus had faith.\nGod is greater than our weakness. In fact, I think it is our weakness that shows just how great God is. ',
