Things like getting a shot, trying out for the team, even getting a tooth pulled.\nThere are times when we just have to do  what we know we need to do.\nWhen Jesus went back to Jerusalem for the last time, He knew what He had to do. It wasn’t going to be easy. It was by far the hardest thing any person has ever had to do. But He was determined to follow His Father’s plan. He was determined to save us from our sins. And He knew He would have to die to do it (Luke 9:51).\nJesus said, “I am the good shepherd. . . . I give my life for the sheep”\n(John 10:14–15). And that is what He did. He gave His life on the cross to save His sheep—to save you.\nSome people call it grace. Some people call it salvation or sacrifice. Jesus called it love. “For God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son.\nGod gave his Son so that whoever believes in him may not be lost, but have eternal life” (John 3:16). ',

God even has a perfect plan for your life (Jeremiah 29:11). Ask Him to help you see and follow His plan.'
