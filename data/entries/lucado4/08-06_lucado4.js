    "body": 'Real change is an inside job. What does that mean? It means that you can change the way you look on the outside with money and clothes and stuff, but changing who  you are—changing your heart—that’s an inside job.\nThat’s because our problem is not on the outside. It’s not money, clothes, or stuff. Our problem is on the inside: our sin. Sin is when we do what we know is wrong. It is disobeying our Creator. And because God is perfect and has no sin in Him, He cannot be around us when we have sin inside us.\nOur sin keeps us from getting close to God.\nBut—and here’s the really great news—God loves us so much that He doesn’t want to be cut off from us. So He gave us a way to get rid of the sin inside us. He gave us His Son. When we choose to follow Jesus, He washes away all our sins. Jesus changes us from the inside  out. ',

      "text": 'What “inside” things would you like to change about yourself? Think about the ways you want to change so that you can be more like Jesus. Ask for God’s help. He always gives to those who ask: “If any of you needs wisdom, you should ask God for it. God is generous. He enjoys giving to all people” (James 1:5).'
