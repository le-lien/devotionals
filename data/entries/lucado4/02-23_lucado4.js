You must choose to believe that the God who created everything hasn’t left it all—that He is still here and still working.\nYou must choose to believe that He still sends the light of His love to chase away the dark shadows of this world. And you must choose to believe that He still hears and answers your prayers.\nFaith is believing that God will do what is right.\nGod says that the more hopeless things seem to be, the more He will help you. The greater your worries are, the harder you will pray. And the darker your troubles are, the greater your need for His light.\nGod’s help is always near and always ready for you. But His help is only given to those who look for it. ',
