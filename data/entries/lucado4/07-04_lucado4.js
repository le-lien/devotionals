Want examples?\n• David the psalmist became David the murderer, but by God’s grace, he became David the psalmist again.\n• Peter denied Jesus three times before he preached Jesus.\n• Zacchaeus was a crook. He stole money, and his heart was dirty with greed. But Jesus still had time for him.\n• The thief on the cross was headed for hell and hung out to die one minute, but he was heaven-bound and smiling the next.\nStory after story. Prayer after prayer. It seems that God is looking more for ways to get us home to heaven than for ways to keep us out. ',
