    "body": 'The writer of Hebrews takes us on a Discovery Channel–style tour of heaven. Listen to how he describes the mountaintop of Zion. He says when we reach the mountain we will have come to “the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem. You have come to thousands of angels gathered with joy. You have come to the meeting of God’s firstborn children. Their names are written in heaven. You have come to God”\n(Hebrews 12:22–23).\nWhat a mountain! Won’t it be great to see the angels? To finally know what they look like and who they are?\nImagine the meeting! A gathering of all God’s children. No jealousy. No popular and unpopular. No in-crowd and out-crowd. We will all be perfect .\n. . sinless.\nAnd imagine seeing God. Face-to-face. To finally gaze into your Father’s eyes. To see Him looking at you. For all eternity. ',
