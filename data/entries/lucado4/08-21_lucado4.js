    "body": 'When do we get our first clue that Jesus knew He is the Son of God?\nIn the temple of Jerusalem. He was twelve years old. His parents were three days into their return trip to Nazareth before they noticed He was missing. They found Him in the temple studying with the leaders.\nAs a young boy, Jesus already heard the call of God. But what did He do when He left the temple? Start rounding up apostles and preaching sermons and performing miracles? No, He went home with His folks, learned the family business, and finished growing up.\nAnd that is exactly what you should do. Want to bring focus to your life?\nDo what Jesus did. Be home, love your family, and take care of the business of growing up. “But, Mr. Lucado, I want to be a missionary when I grow up,” you might say. Your first mission field is at home. To be able to show love to people overseas, you first need to be able to show love to the people who live across the hall. ',
