Anger shows up, and we say,\n“Welcome!” Revenge needs a place to stay, so we have him pull up a chair.\nPity wants to have a party, so we show him the kitchen. Jealousy rings the doorbell, and we show him to the guest room. Don’t we know how to say no?\nMany of us don’t. For most of us, watching our thoughts is, well, unthought  of. We watch our time, our clothes, our homework, even our hair.\nBut not our thoughts. Shouldn’t we be as worried about our thoughts as we are about everything else? Jesus was. Like a trained soldier at the gate of a city, He stood watch over His mind. He guarded the gate to His heart.\nIf Jesus did, shouldn’t we? ',

      "text": 'There’s an old saying that goes, “You are what you eat.” But it’s just as true to say, “You are what you think.” If you think thoughts of anger, revenge, pity, or jealousy—then you become angry, vengeful, pitiful, and jealous. So kick out those thoughts … and invite God in.'
