    "body": 'There’s an old saying that goes, “Don’t just talk the talk; walk the walk.” But what does that mean? For Christians, it means walking—or living—like Jesus.\nA lot of people can tell you what Jesus said. They know the verses by heart. They can say all the right words and sing all the right songs. They can\n“talk the talk.” But not nearly as many people can do  what Jesus said. They have trouble when it comes time to “walk the walk”—to live like Jesus said they should.\nIt’s very easy to say, “Obey your parents.” It’s not so easy to stop playing and clean up your room. It’s easy to say, “Forgive others.” It’s not so easy to forgive that friend who called you names. It’s easy to say, “Love your enemies.” It’s not so easy to be kind to someone who has been unkind to you.\nNo, it’s not easy at all. But it is “walking the walk”—and it’s what Jesus wants you to do.
