Those who never heard people cheer for them will hear the cheers of the angels. Those who missed the blessing of a father on earth will hear the blessing of their Father in heaven.\nThose who were put down on earth will be lifted up in heaven. The forgotten will be remembered, the ignored will be welcomed, and the faithful will be honored.\nIn heaven, the winner’s circle isn’t just for the rich and famous. It’s for a heaven full of God’s children who “will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him” (James 1:12 NIV). ',
