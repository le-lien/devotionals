    "body": 'It is important to pray. But it’s just as important to believe that God is in heaven and answers your prayers. To pray without believing makes your prayers weak. If you’re having trouble believing, spend some time looking up at the sun, moon, and stars. They show the power and majesty of God.\nJust look and see the great things that He has done!\nThink about the sun. Every square yard of it gives off the power of more than 450 car engines. And yet our sun—as powerful as it is—is just one small star out of the 100 billion stars that make up our Milky Way galaxy.\nHold a dime in your fingers and stretch your arm toward the night sky. That small dime blocks over 15 million stars from your view!\nBy showing us the heavens, Jesus is showing us His Father’s awesomeness. It’s as if Jesus is tapping you on the shoulder and saying,\n“Your Father made all of that, so you can believe that He can take care of you.” ',
