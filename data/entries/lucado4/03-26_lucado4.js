It’s the nurse who holds your hand when you get a shot or the friendly face that greets you on your first day in a new class.\nCan you offer God’s touch to someone?\nMaybe you already do. Maybe you have figured out how to touch people with God’s love. Your hands pray for the sick, help bake cookies for the shut-ins, and hug the lonely. You have learned the power of a touch.\nOr maybe you’ve never tried to touch others. Your heart is good, but you’ve forgotten how important one touch can be. Just look at how Jesus reached out to touch others. Aren’t you glad He reached out to touch you? ',
