Look at Me! The Maker of all that you see. Watch Me sneeze, and cough, and blow My nose. You wonder if I understand how you feel? See the toddler at Mary’s table; that’s God spilling His milk. Look into the dancing eyes of that kid playing with His friends in Nazareth; that’s God walking to school.\n“Do you want to know how much I love you? I love you enough to leave heaven. To be a toddler and stub My toe as I learn to walk. To smash My thumb in the carpenter’s shop. I love you enough to be insulted by the very people I created. To be betrayed by My friends. To die on the cross for you.\nThat’s how much I love you.” ',
