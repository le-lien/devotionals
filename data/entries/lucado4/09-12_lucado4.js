What we see as the greatest sadness, He sees as the greatest victory.\nA seed must die and be buried before it can grow. So when a Christian dies, it’s not just a time for sadness; it is a time to trust. Like the seed, the body is buried. And just as a buried seed sprouts new life, so our body will blossom into a new body.\nThe seeds of the Christians’ bodies buried in the earth will blossom in heaven. Our souls and bodies will be one again, and we will be like Jesus. ',
