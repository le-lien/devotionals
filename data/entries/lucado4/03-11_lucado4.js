    "body": 'When Jesus washed the disciples’ feet, He knew the future of those feet. Not one of them would spend the next day following Him or defending Him. Those feet would run for cover at the first flash of a Roman sword. Only one pair of feet wouldn’t run away from Him in the garden.\nJudas wouldn’t even make it that far!\nSo why did He do it? Why did Jesus stoop to wash the disciples’ feet?\nThe answer is in one word: mercy. Jesus knew what those men were about to do, and He wanted to give them something to remember. He wanted them to remember that He had washed their feet. He wanted them to know that those feet were still clean and that He had forgiven their sin before they even did it. He gave them mercy before they even asked for it.\nThat mercy is there for you too. When you choose to believe in Jesus and to obey Him, His mercy will make you clean. ',
