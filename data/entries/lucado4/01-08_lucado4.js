    "body": 'In Bible times, the roads were often made of dirt, so people’s feet were caked with mud and dirt. Washing those feet was the yuckiest job around. It was a servant’s job. But at the Last Supper, Jesus became the servant. He washed His followers’ feet, the dirtiest part of them. And He will wash the dirtiest part of you … if you let Him.\nSin makes your heart even dirtier than those followers’ feet. Jesus will wash away that dirt, but only if you confess—or tell Him—that you are dirty. Tell Him about that bad thought, that bad word, that thing you wish you hadn’t done.\nIf you pretend your heart is clean—that you never mess up or sin—Jesus cannot wash you. You will never be clean until you first tell Him you are dirty. But if you just tell Him, He will wash all those sins away. He will wash you “whiter than snow” (Psalm 51:7). ',
