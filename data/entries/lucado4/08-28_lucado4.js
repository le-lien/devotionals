We were made to live forever, but on earth we live for just a moment.\nWe must trust God, that He will do what is best and that He knows what is ahead. Look at Isaiah 57:1–2: “Good people are taken away, but no one understands. Those who do right are being taken away from evil and are given peace” (NCV).\nWow! What a thought. God takes good people away from the evil. Could death be part of God’s grace? It isn’t always easy to understand the things that happen on this earth—why good people get sick, or hurt, or even die.\nBut we can always believe that God does what is best for each of His children. He is always taking care of us—especially in times of sickness and death.\nTrust in God, Jesus encourages us, and trust in Me. ',
