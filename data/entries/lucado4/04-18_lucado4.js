Not really.\nLove held Jesus on the cross.\nJesus knew that our sins had to be punished, and He loved us so much that He took our punishment for us. Jesus—who had never sinned—took on all of our sins and let them die on the cross with Him.\nGod could have sent His army of angels to save Jesus, but He didn’t. He didn’t, because God would rather give up His Son than give up on getting us to heaven.\nNo matter what you’ve done or said, no matter how big the mistake was, it’s not too late to talk to God about it, to ask for forgiveness, and to be free from all sin and guilt.\nWhat makes you a Christian is not that you’re perfect but that you’re forgiven.
