Now let’s go play.” It’s the parent who hugs you and says, “Let’s try that again.”\nAnd it’s the Savior who loves you so much that He died to save you.\nYou see, Jesus came to earth for one reason: to give His life to save you, to save me, to save all of us. To give us a second chance. He loves each of us so much that He would have suffered through anything to save us. And He did. He went to the cross.\nJesus—who was perfect and without any sin—gave His perfection to us.\nAnd all our sins, all our mistakes and imperfections, were given to Him.\nBecause Jesus was willing to take them, we are forgiven and given a second chance.

It means that God loves you when you aren’t lovable. Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross is your second chance to get it right.'
