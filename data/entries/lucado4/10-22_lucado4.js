You could see God just as clearly as you could see a tree or a flower.\nThen, suddenly, the window cracked. First one pebble hit it, and then another, and another. Those pebbles were the problems and worries that came into your life. Now the window of your heart is a spiderweb of cracks.\nAnd suddenly God isn’t so easy to see.\nIt can be frightening and confusing. Why would God allow this to happen? Why can’t you see Him?\nWhen you can’t see God, trust Him. Because that is when Jesus is closer than you’ve ever dreamed. ',

When the fog melts away, you’ll see clearly again. It’s the same with God. Sometimes we must wait for the fog (our troubles) to melt away. Then we can clearly see how God has been there the whole time.'
