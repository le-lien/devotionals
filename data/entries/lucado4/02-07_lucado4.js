    "body": 'If you could ask God for just one thing, what would it be? David told us what he would ask: “I ask only one thing from the Lord. This is what I want: Let me live in the Lord’s house all my life. Let me see the Lord’s beauty. Let me look around in his Temple. During danger he will keep me safe in his shelter. He will hide me in his Holy Tent. Or he will keep me safe on a high mountain” (Psalm 27:4–5).\nDavid asked to live in “the Lord’s house.” Was he talking about a real house or about heaven? Neither. David was talking about living in the presence  of God. David wanted to be so close to God that His presence covered and protected him just like the walls of a house.\nDavid wasn’t just asking for a visit with God. He didn’t want to stop by for a chat or a glass of lemonade on the back porch. He didn’t ask to spend an evening with God. He wanted to live  with God, to move in with Him and have his own room … forever. ',
