    "body": 'When I was ten years old, my mother made me take piano lessons.\nSpending thirty minutes every afternoon on that piano bench was torture.\nSome of the music, though, I learned to enjoy. I hammered the staccatos.\nI pounded the crescendos. But there was one instruction in the music I could never get quite right. The rest. That zigzag-looking sign to do nothing. What sense does that make? Why sit at the piano and pause when you can pound?\n“Because,” my teacher patiently explained, “music is always sweeter after a rest.”\nIt didn’t make sense to me then. But now my teacher’s words ring with wisdom—divine wisdom. Music is sweeter after a rest. And life is sweeter after you rest in the Lord. ',
