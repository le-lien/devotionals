Jesus teaches us to pray, “Forgive the sins we have done\n… [and] do not cause us to be tested” (Matthew 6:12–13).\nWe’ve all made mistakes, and we’ll all make some more. Paul asked, “So why do you judge your brother in Christ? And why do you think that you are better than he is? We will all stand before God, and he will judge us all”\n(Romans 14:10).\nDo you have a brother or sister who could use some grace from you?\nMaybe your sister needs your forgiveness just as you need forgiveness from God. It’s better to forgive rather than to try to get even. Sometimes tattling and getting revenge only make things worse. And as for your brother, there comes a time when the best thing you can do is love him. Offer him the same grace and forgiveness that you’ve been given. ',
