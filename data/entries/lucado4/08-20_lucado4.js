    "body": 'Growing a stronger faith should be the goal of every Christian.\nMaturing is a must.\nIf you stopped growing taller, your parents would be worried, right? They would try to get help for you.\nWhen a Christian’s faith stops growing, help is needed too. If you are the same Christian you were last year, be careful. You might need to get a checkup. Not on your body, but on your heart. Not a physical, but a spiritual.\nMay I suggest one?\nWhy don’t you check your habits? Make these four habits part of your daily activities, and see what happens.\nFirst, the habit of prayer. Second, the habit of Bible study. Third, the habit of giving both your time and your money to God’s work here on earth.\nAnd, last, the habit of fellowship and friendship with other Christians. ',
