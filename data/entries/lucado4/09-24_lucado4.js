Whether it is saying good-bye to a friend who moves away or to a loved one who has passed away, being apart from the ones we love is hard. When death is the reason for our good-bye, it is especially tough. It is right for us to be sad and to cry, but we don’t have to give up hope. Remember: They had pain here on earth, but they have no pain there in heaven. They struggled here on earth, but they have no struggles there in heaven.\nYou and I might wonder why God took them to heaven. But they don’t.\nThey understand. They are, at this very second, at peace and with God.\nWhen it is cold here on earth, we can take comfort in knowing that our loved ones are safe in the warm arms of God. And when Jesus comes back, we will see them again. ',
