    "body": 'Alot of us live with a secret fear that God is angry at us.\nSomewhere, sometime, some Sunday school class or some television show made us believe that God is spying on us. That He’s just waiting for a chance to catch us being bad so that He can punish us.\nNothing could be more wrong! God cares for us and only wants to share His love with us.\nWe have a heavenly Father who is filled with compassion—which means that when we hurt, He hurts. We serve a God who says that even when we’re stressed out and we feel like nothing is going right, He is waiting for us. And He is ready to wrap us up in His love whether we win or lose.\nGod doesn’t come fighting and forcing His way into anyone’s heart. He comes into our hearts like a gentle lamb, not a roaring lion.
