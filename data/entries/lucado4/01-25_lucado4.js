Through an amazing series of events, you go from being a hopeless sinner to a beloved child of God.\nWhat does that mean? It means that when you mess up, when you do something that you know is wrong (and we all do sometimes!), you deserve to be punished. But God loves you so much that He created a plan to forgive you. That plan meant sending His own Son, Jesus, to die on the cross. Jesus was punished for your sins so that you don’t have to be. You are forgiven! But the story doesn’t end with God’s forgiveness.\nIt would be enough if God just forgave your sins, but He does more. He adopts you and gives you His  name. ',
