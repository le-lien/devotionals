He promises it to the most unlikely people: those who know they have messed up and who beg for His forgiveness; those whose hearts are broken because of their sin; those who forgive others—even the people who have hurt them deeply; those who keep their thoughts always on God and His love; those who reach out to hurting people with the love of Jesus; and those who are treated badly, laughed at, and made fun of for doing the good work of Jesus.\nIt is to these people that God promises a special blessing. A heavenly blessing. A holy joy. ',

      "text": 'The verses from Matthew 5:3–12 are known as the Beatitudes or “Bee-Attitudes.” Draw and cut out eight bees (a circle with two wings). Write one of the “Bee-Attitudes” on each—spiritually needy, sad for sins, humble, wanting to do right, merciful, pure, peacemaking, and treated badly for doing good. Tape them to your mirror or door to help you “bee” right with God!'
