And He knows the answer to their every question.\n“How long am I going to be without a friend?”\n“How long am I going to be sick?”\n“How long am I going to struggle to get along with my family?”\nDo you really want God to answer? He could, you know. He could answer exactly how many weeks, or days, or hours. “A few more months without a friend.” “Two more years of illness.” “The rest of your life with your family.”\nBut God doesn’t usually do that. He asks us to trust Him. He uses our times of loneliness, sickness, and struggle to teach us to turn to Him for help. Although our troubles sometimes seem to last forever, they really don’t—but heaven does. So hold on. ',
