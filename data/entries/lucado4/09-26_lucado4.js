    "body": 'In the Sermon on the Mount, what Jesus promised is not some trick to give you goose bumps, or some coach’s speech to pump you up. No, in Matthew 5, Jesus described God’s radical remake of our hearts.\nCheck out how it begins: First, we see that we are in need (we’re poor in spirit). Next, we repent of trying to save ourselves (we mourn). We stop trying to be boss of our lives and give control to God (we’re meek). We are so grateful for God’s presence that we want more of Him (we hunger and thirst). As we grow closer to God, we become more like Him. We forgive others (we’re merciful). We change our way of looking at things (we’re pure in heart). We love others (we’re peacemakers). We suffer through unfairness (we’re persecuted).\nThis is no small change. It’s tearing down the old self and creating the new. The greater the change, the greater the joy. ',
