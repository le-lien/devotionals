    "body": 'The night that Jesus was born was an ordinary night with ordinary sheep and ordinary shepherds. And if it were not for a God who loves to stick an extra  on the front of ordinary, the night would have passed just like any other. The sheep would have been forgotten, and the shepherds would have slept the night away.\nBut God loves to add His “extra” to the most ordinary of things.\nSo on that night, the black sky exploded with brightness. One minute the shepherds were sound asleep; the next they were rubbing their eyes and staring into the face of an angel.\nThe night was no longer ordinary.\nThe angel came in the night because that is when lights are best seen and most needed. God shows Himself to us in our darkest times and in the most ordinary of things for the same reason. Because that is when He is most needed and best seen. He’s easy to find—just look for the “extra” in the ordinary. ',

      "text": 'God is easy to find this time of year. See Him in twinkling lights and hear Him in the “Hallelujah Chorus.” But God is also in the ordinary, the everyday. He’s in the perfection of each snowflake and the whistling winter wind. When you learn to see God in the ordinary, no day is ever truly ordinary again.'
