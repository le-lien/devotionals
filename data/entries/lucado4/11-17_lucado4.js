    "body": 'Some people are not who they should be. Instead of giving friendship and encouragement to those around them, they treat them unkindly.\nThey laugh at others and make fun of them. Sometimes they pretend that others just aren’t important enough for them to even notice. We call them bullies. God calls them lost.\nSo what do you do? What do you do when the bullies are the popular kids everyone else wants to be like? Do you dare to be different? Do you dare to be the person God made you to be? Or do you just go along with the crowd and be like them?\nIt’s your choice, but you don’t have to make it alone. Jesus Himself said,\n“You can be sure that I will be with you always” (Matthew 28:20). Always.\nWhen the bullies laugh, when the in-crowd puts you in the out-crowd, Jesus will be there with you. ',
