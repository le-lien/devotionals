    "body": 'The stadium is packed today. Everyone has come to see him  play. As soon as he walks into the stadium, the fans are on their feet. He steps up to the plate, bat in hand. The crowd roars. He swings, and the ball soars into the air and into the stands. Home run! The fans are still on their feet long after he crosses home plate.\nNot everyone can be a home run king. For every million kids who dream of it, only one makes it. Most of us don’t hit the big ball, don’t get the parade, don’t wear the gold medal, don’t give the president’s speech. And that’s okay. We know that in this world, only a few people win crowns.\nIn heaven, though, it’s a whole different story. Heavenly rewards are not limited to a chosen few, but “to all those who have waited with love for him to come again” (2 Timothy 4:8). That’s so much better than any crown on earth! ',
