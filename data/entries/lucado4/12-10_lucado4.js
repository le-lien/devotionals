    "body": 'John’s descriptions of the future in Revelation can take your breath away.\nHis description of the final battle is graphic. Good clashes with evil. The holy and sacred battle the sinful. The pages are filled with the shrieks of dragons and smolder with the fires of blazing pits. But in the middle of the battlefield there is the most beautiful sight. John described it in chapter 21:\n“I saw the holy city coming down out of heaven from God. This holy city is the new Jerusalem. It was prepared like a bride dressed for her husband” (v.\n2).\nIn this final mountaintop scene, God pulled back the curtain and let John peek into heaven. God gave him a glimpse of his future reward. And when John sat down to write about what he saw, he compared heaven to the most beautiful image earth has to offer. The holy city, John said, is like “a bride dressed for her husband.”\nThere are many beautiful things on this earth, but we will never see anything as beautiful as God’s heaven. ',
