Sunday school lessons about prayer are great, but to really get better at prayer, you have to—you guessed it— pray.\nWhether you sit or stand, say them in your mind or with a shout—\nwhether you are inside, outside, or even upside down isn’t really important for your personal prayers. Do whatever works for you. But don’t think about it too much. Don’t be so worried about how your prayers should look and sound that you never get around to praying. Better to pray awkwardly than not at all.\nGod hears every prayer and blesses every person who prays. And the more you pray, the easier it will become. Soon it will be just like talking to an old friend—the very best Friend of all. ',
