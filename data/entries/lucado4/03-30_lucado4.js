It was God and His love for each of us that held those hands on the cross.\nThose same hands scooped out the oceans and built up the mountains.\nThose same hands set the sunrise in place and created each cloud. Those same hands designed an incredible plan to save you and me. Those hands could have reached out and called ten thousand angels to save Jesus from the cross.\nBut He didn’t.\nWhy? Because those hands that made you and placed you on this planet also wrote this promise: “God would give up His only Son to save you.”\nAnd so He did. ',
