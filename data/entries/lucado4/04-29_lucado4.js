So rather than spend time with God, listening for His voice, we let others do it and then tell us what God said. After all, isn’t that what preachers and parents are for?\nIf that’s what you’re thinking—if your ideas about God come only from others and not from spending time with Him yourself—think about this: Do you do that with other parts of your life?\nDo you let other people go on vacation for you? Do you let other people play with your friends for you? You don’t let someone else eat for you, do you? There are some things that no one else can do for you. Only you can.\nAnd one of those things is spending time with God. ',
