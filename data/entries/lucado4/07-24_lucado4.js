Telling Him that you know He is all-powerful. Telling Him how grateful you are for all that He does. And simply telling Him how very much you love Him.\nWe were created to praise, honor, and glorify God. But how do we do that? There are many different ways. You can praise God with the songs you sing. You can honor Him with your gifts of time and service and money. You can glorify Him by helping others. But that’s not all. Pray to Him. Study Him. Notice His work in nature. There are so many different ways to praise God.\nBut the most important thing is simply to praise Him—each and every day. ',
