He was there in the garden, looking for Adam and Eve. They were hiding in the bushes, ashamed and afraid. Did God wait for them to come to Him? No, His words rang out through the garden. “Where are you?” God asked (Genesis 3:9).\nNow, God knew where Adam and Eve were hidden, but He wanted them to know that He was searching for them. That He hadn’t left them all alone.\nAnd He wanted them to come out and find Him. All through the Bible God calls out to His children, hoping that they will come out and find Him.\nHe’s calling to you too. He’s not hard to find. He’s only a word away.\nPray that He will help you find Him today. ',
