And I was just one of His loyal helpers. He had His office, and I had mine. I went out to do His work and then reported back. I could call Him as much as I wanted. He was always just a phone call or e-mail away. He encouraged me, cheered me on, and supported me, but He didn’t go with me. At least I didn’t think He did. Then I read 2 Corinthians 6:1: “We are workers together with God.”\nWorkers with  God? Working together? God and I working together?\nWow! We don’t just report back to God; we work with God. We don’t check in with Him and leave; we check in with Him and then follow. We are always in the presence of God. Every moment is sacred! ',
