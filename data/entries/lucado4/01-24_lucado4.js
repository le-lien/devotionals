So He got in a boat and crossed over the Sea of Galilee.\nBut the people followed Him. When Jesus stepped out of the boat, He stepped into a sea of people. And Jesus felt sorry for them. His love for the people was greater than His need for rest.\nMany of those He healed would never say, “Thank You,” but He healed them anyway. Most just wanted to be healthy, not holy, but He healed them anyway. Some of those who asked for bread would cry for Him to be killed just a few months later, but He healed them anyway.\nJesus cared for them … anyway. ',
