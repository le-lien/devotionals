If only you knew that tomorrow will be better than today. If only you knew the gift that I bring you: eternal life. If only you knew I want you safely home with Me. If only you knew.\nWhat wishful, wistful words to come from the lips of God. How kind that He would let us hear them. How important it is that we stop to hear them. If only we knew to trust God. Trust that He is in our corner. Trust that God wants what is best for us.\nIf only we could learn to trust Him. Won’t you trust Him? ',
