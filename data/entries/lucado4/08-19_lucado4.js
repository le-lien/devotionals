Listen to His voice whispering to you in the wind. No crowds of people. No school. No practice. Just you and God.\nGod gently invites you to sit on that high rock, far above the trees, and look out with Him at the ancient mountain peaks that will never be worn down. He asks you to listen as He says:\n“The things that are needed for your salvation will always be there for you.”\n“There is nowhere you can go tomorrow that I have not already been.”\n“My truth will always win out over evil.”\n“The victory—heaven—is yours.”\nSpend some quiet time in prayer on God’s sacred summit, His mountaintop. It’s an unchanging place in an ever-changing world. ',
