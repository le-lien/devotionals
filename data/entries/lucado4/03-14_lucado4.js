But he never wins the whole fight. Why? Because Jesus sticks up for you. Jesus is\n“always able to save those who come to God through him. He can do this, because he always lives, ready to help those who come before God”\n(Hebrews 7:25).\nJesus, at this very second, is protecting you. When the devil comes to tempt you to do wrong, Jesus takes up for you. He helps you to stand strong against the devil. And He will “not let you be tempted more than you can stand. But when you are tempted, God will also give you a way to escape that temptation. Then you will be able to stand it” (1 Corinthians 10:13).\nJesus is on your side. He never stops fighting for you. ',
