What right did he have to pray, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom!” (Luke 23:42)?\nDo you really want to know? He had the same right to ask Jesus to save him as we do.\nHave we used every second of our time as we should? Probably not.\nHave we ever laughed at someone or made fun of them? Probably so. Do we deserve Jesus’ help? Definitely not.\nWe can’t take out our list of all the good things we’ve done, because we could never do enough good to get us to heaven. In the single most important way of all, we are just like that thief—our only hope of getting into heaven is Jesus.\nSo, just like the thief, we pray, “Jesus, remember me.”\nAnd just like the thief, we hear the voice of Jesus say, “You will be with me in paradise!” ',
