    "body": 'Hatred can sneak up on you. It usually starts with something tiny, like a scratch on your brand-new bike. But then it builds. Every time you climb on your bike, that scratch is all you see. You’d only had that bike a day! You didn’t see who did it, but you bet you can describe him. Big kid, wart on his chin, bully, kicks kittens for fun.\nLet me say this clearly. Hatred will sour your attitude and break your back. The load of anger is simply too heavy to carry. Your knees will buckle under the strain, and your heart will break beneath the weight. The mountain of life is steep enough and hard enough to climb without a load of hatred on your back. The smartest choice—the only good choice—is for you to drop the anger.\nGod will never ask you to give anyone more grace than He has already given you. ',
