But we are not even on the way home before we dread the end of the trip and begin wishing for the next one.\nWe are not content. We are not happy. We are not satisfied.\nAs a kid we say, “If only I were a teenager.” As a teen we say, “If only I were an adult.” As an adult, “If only I were married.” As a married person,\n“If only I had kids.”\nWe are not satisfied. Why is it so hard to be content?\nBecause there is nothing on earth that can satisfy our deepest want—to see God. Everything in His creation is whispering that we will see Him, and we won’t be content until we do. ',
