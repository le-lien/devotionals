    "body": 'The white space between the lines of the Bible verses leaves room for lots of questions. You can hardly read Scripture without whispering, “I wonder …”\n“I wonder if Eve ever ate any more fruit.”\n“I wonder if Noah had trouble sleeping during thunderstorms.”\n“I wonder if Jonah ever wanted to eat fish for dinner.”\nBut in your wonderings, there are some questions you never need to ask: Does God care? Do you matter to God? Does He still love His children?\nGod sent a tiny baby to be born in a stable. That was the proof that, yes, God cares.\nYes, your sins are forgiven. Yes, your name is written in heaven. And, yes, God is in your world.\nImmanuel  means “God is with us” … and He is. ',
