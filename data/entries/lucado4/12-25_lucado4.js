He stepped out of the majesty of heaven and into the arms of a humble peasant girl.\nThe All-Powerful One, in an instant, became flesh and blood. The One who was larger than the universe became the tiniest of infants. And He who created the world with a word chose to depend upon a young girl named Mary for His human life.\nGod had come down from heaven. God had come near to His people …\nto show us the way back home to heaven. ',
