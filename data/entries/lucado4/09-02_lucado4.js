    "body": 'Jesus talked about freedom, but it’s a different kind of freedom. His freedom doesn’t come through having more rights and power, but through giving up yours. It’s not about controlling everything, but giving up your control to Him. And it’s not about collecting the stuff of this world, but giving it away.\nSounds a little strange, doesn’t it? God wants to free  His people by having them surrender to Him. You see, God wants us to be His sons and daughters, not slaves to the stuff of this world. He wants us to be ruled by His love.\nBy believing that Jesus died for our salvation, we are freed from trying to work our way to heaven. We are free to pray and to love God with all our hearts. And we are free from our sins because we have been forgiven by the only One who can call us guilty. We are truly free! ',
