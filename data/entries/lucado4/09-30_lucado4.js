    "body": 'Awhile back, my daughter Jenna and I spent several days in the old city of Jerusalem. One afternoon we found ourselves behind an orthodox Jewish family—a father and his three small girls. One of the daughters, perhaps four or five years old, fell a few steps behind and couldn’t see her father. “Abba!” she called to him. Her abba—her father—spotted her and immediately held out his hand.\nWhen the light changed, he led her and her sisters across the street. In the middle of the street, he reached down and swung her up into his arms, and they went on with their journey.\nIsn’t that what we all need? An abba  who will hear us when we call?\nWho will take our hand when we are lost? Who will guide us through the streets of life? Don’t we all need an abba  who will swing us up into his arms and carry us home? We all need a Father. ',

      "text": 'Abba means “Father.” But more than that, it means “Daddy.” What’s the difference?  Father is stiff, formal, and not much fun.  Daddy is the one whose lap you curl up in, who stops to listen when you talk, and who swings you up in the air just to delight you. Abba is Daddy. Abba is God. October We know the love that God has for us, and we trust that love. —1 JOHN 4:16'
