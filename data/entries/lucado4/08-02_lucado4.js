The old movie theater where I went with my friends has “For Sale”\nup on its sign.\nI wish I could make it all new again. I wish I could blow the dust off the streets, but I can’t.\nI can’t. Just like I can’t dust the sin off my soul or erase my mistakes. But God can. “He restores my soul,” wrote the shepherd. God doesn’t change our souls. He restores  them. He makes them new again. He doesn’t just cover up the old; He makes the old new. The Master Builder will pull out the original plan and make it just like new. He will restore the liveliness. He will restore the energy. He will restore the hope. He will restore your soul. ',
