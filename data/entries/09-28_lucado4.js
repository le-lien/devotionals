    "body": 'God wants you to “think and act like Christ Jesus” (Philippians 2:5).\nBut how? The answer is surprisingly simple. It takes just one decision: I will let Jesus rule my thoughts.\nJesus is the Ruler of heaven and earth. He has the final say on everything, especially our thoughts. He has more power, for example, than your classmates. They may say you’re not cool enough to hang out with them.\nBut Jesus says you are cool enough to inherit His kingdom. And He has power over your peers.\nJesus also rules over your ideas. Suppose you have an idea to cheat on a test. But Jesus has said that stealing is wrong, and that includes stealing answers. If you have decided to let Him rule over your ideas, then the idea of cheating cannot stay in your thoughts. ',

      "text": 'Growing in Grace How many different rulers can you think of? There are presidents and prime ministers to rule over countries. Principals rule their schools. And parents rule over their children. But Jesus is Ruler of all. Choose to follow His rules above all others. Find the two greatest rules in Mark 12:29–31.'
