His whole life could be described with one sentence:\n“The Son of Man came to find lost people and save them” (Luke 19:10).\nBut He was not so busy working toward His goal that He was unpleasant to be around.

He would spend days with crowds of sick people and still feel sorry for them. He spent more than thirty years on this earth. He lived in a world full of sin and anger and hatred. Yet He still saw enough beauty in people to die for their mistakes and for ours.',
