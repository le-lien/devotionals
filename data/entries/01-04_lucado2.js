He knew immediately what was happening. It was her son who was being carried out, her only son. And if anyone knows the pain that comes from losing your only son, God does.\nSo he did it; he went into action. “Don’t cry” he told the mother. “Arise!” he told the boy. The dead man spoke, the devil ran, and the people were reminded of this truth: For those who know the Author of Life, death is nothing more than Satan’s dead-man’s-bluff. ',
