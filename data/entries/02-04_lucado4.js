You go to the doctor.\nWhen you sin, your heart is hurt and needs healing. And just as you have to do something when your body is hurt, when your heart is hurt, you also have to do something. Healing begins when you reach out to God, when you tell Him how sorry you are, and when you ask Him to forgive you.\nGod’s help is always near, but He only gives it to those who ask for it.\nNothing comes from doing nothing. God helps those who bravely reach out to Him and ask for help. ',
