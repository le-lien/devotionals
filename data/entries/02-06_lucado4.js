God does not live in a body like yours, so He can do things that your body cannot do.\nHow can God hear all the prayers of all the people? Maybe His ears are different from yours.\nHow can God be the Father, the Son, and  the Holy Spirit—all at once? Could it be that the natural laws of heaven are different from those of earth? ',
