Does Matt even have a chance of making these shots? He’s 0 for 6 on the day.\nHe’s also blind.\nHow does a blind kid end up on the foul line? Because of his big brother.\nJoe Stevens spent a childhood helping Matt do the impossible: ride a bike, ice skate, play soccer. So, when Joe joined the basketball team, he brought his baby brother with him. Now, with the referees’ permission, Joe taps the rim of the basket with a cane. Matt listens, pauses, and shoots. Swish! The game is tied! The crowd settles down so Matt can hear the click again. Swish number two! The game ends. Matt is the hero. All because of a big brother who made all the difference.4\nYou too have a big brother walking you through the rough patches of life, helping you do the impossible. Listen and you’ll hear him tapping. His name is Jesus.\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
