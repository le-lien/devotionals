Are the claims of the empty tomb true? This is not only a good question. It is the  question.\nFor as Paul wrote, “If Christ has not been raised, then your faith has nothing to it; you are still guilty of your sins” (1 Cor.15:17). In other words, if Christ has been raised, then his followers will join him; but if not, then his followers are fools. The resurrection, then, is the keystone in the arch of the Christian faith. ',
