The sculptor of Mount Rushmore faced a lesser challenge than does God. But our Lord is up to the task. He loves to change the faces of his children. By his fingers, wrinkles of worry are rubbed away. Shadows of shame and doubt become portraits of grace and trust. He relaxes clenched jaws and smooths furrowed brows. His touch can remove bags of exhaustion from beneath the eyes and turn tears of despair into tears of peace.\nHow? Through worship.\nWe’d expect something more complicated, more demanding. A forty-day fast or the memorization of the Gospels, perhaps. No. God’s plan is simpler.\nOur singing, praising, and shouting about his goodness does something good to us. What happens inside is reflected on the outside. God changes our faces through worship. ',
