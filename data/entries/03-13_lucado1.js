For who would have ever thought to ask God for what he gives? Which of us would have dared to say: “God, would you please hang yourself on a tool of torture as a substitution for every mistake I have ever committed?” And then have the audacity to add: “And after you forgive me, could you prepare me a place in your house to live forever?”\nAnd if that wasn’t enough: “And would you please live within me and protect me and guide me and bless me with more than I could ever deserve?”\nHonestly, would we have the chutzpah to ask for that? …\nJesus already knows the cost of grace. He already knows the price of forgiveness. But he offers it anyway. Love burst his heart. ',
