    "body": 'God was with Adam and Eve, walking with them in the cool of the evening.\nGod was with Abraham, even calling the patriarch his friend.\nGod was with Moses and the children of Israel. . . . He was with the apostles. Peter could touch God’s beard. John could watch God sleep.\nMultitudes could hear his voice. God was with them!\nBut he is in you. . . . He will do what you cannot. Imagine a million dollars being deposited into your checking account. To any observer you look the same, except for the goofy smile, but are you? Not at all! With God in you, you have a million resources that you did not have before!\nCan’t stop worrying? Christ can. And he lives within you.\nCan’t forgive the jerk, forget the past, or forsake your bad habits? Christ can! And he lives within you. ',
