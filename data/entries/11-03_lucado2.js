Stroll through and see Rahab’s rope, Paul’s bucket, David’s sling, and Samson’s jawbone. Wrap your hand around the staff that split the sea and smote the rock. Sniff the ointment that soothed Jesus’ skin and lifted his heart… .\nI don’t know if these items will be there. But I am sure of one thing—the people who used them will.\nThe risk takers: Rahab who sheltered the spy. The brethren who smuggled Paul.\nThe conquerors: David, slinging a stone. Samson, swinging a bone.\nMoses, lifting a rod.\nThe caregivers: Mary at Jesus’ feet. What she gave cost much, but somehow she knew what he would give would cost more. ',
