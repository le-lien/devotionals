Many of God’s people had questions, worries, and doubts too.\nThomas doubted that Jesus had really risen from the dead. So did Jesus turn him away?\nMoses worried about talking to Pharaoh and about leading the Israelites.\nDid God tell him to just forget it and go back home to Midian?\nJob lost everything—his family, his herds, his health. But did God turn away from him?\nAfter Paul became a believer, he was arrested and beaten. Did God leave him? ',

      "title": 'No. God never turns away someone with a sincere heart. Tough questions don’t stump God. He wants to hear our questions. God never turns away the honest searcher. Go to God with your questions. You may not find all the answers, but in finding God, you know the One who does.',
      "text": 'Growing in Grace What are some of the questions you can’t wait to ask God? Questions like, What happened to the dinosaurs? How far does space really go? What was the parting of the Red Sea really like? Just imagine getting to sit with God and listen to His answers.'
