    "body": 'have come across several mental cases. How difficult they are naturally, but how easy for God to deal with. One lady I came saying, "Just over the way there is a young man terribly afflicted, with no rest day or night." I went with a very imperfect knowledge as to what I had to do, but in the weak places, God helps our infirmities. I rebuked the demon in the name of Jesus, and then I said, "I‘ll come again tomorrow." The next day when I went, he was quite well and with his father in the field.\n\nFifty miles away, there was a fine young man, twenty-five years of age. He had lost his reason, could have no communication with his mother, and was always wandering up and down. I knew God was waiting to bless. I cast out the demon power and heard later that he had become quite well.\n\nThus the blessed Holy Spirit takes us on from one place to another. So many things happen; I live in heaven on earth. Do not wait for inspiration if you are in need; the Holy Spirit is available, and you can have perfect deliverance.\n\nI was taken to three persons, one in the care of an attendant. As I entered the room, there was a terrible din and quarreling. It was such a noise it seemed as if all the powers of hell were stirred. I had to wait for God‘s time. The Holy Spirit rose in me at the right time, and the three were delivered. That night, they were singing praises to God.\n\nChrist is the same today. When He reigns in you, you know how to obey and how to work in conjunction with His will, His power, His light, and His life. When we have faith based on knowledge, we know He has come. “You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you”  (Acts 1:8). God is with the person who dares to stand upon His Word.',
