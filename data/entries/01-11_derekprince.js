    "body": 'Psalm 91 has been called the “atomic age psalm.” This is a psalm of perfect protection from every kind of evil, danger, and harm—however it may come, by whatever means, and at whatever time.\nMany Christians know this passage well. But let’s just look at the first two verses:<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.</i>(Psalm 91:1)</p>The word  abide in Hebrew normally means “to pass the night.” It is a word that is frequently used to describe the act of spending the night.\nSo, this tells us that during the hours of darkness, the true believer will be under the shadow, or protection, of the Almighty. Notice the second verse:<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>I will say of the Lord, “He is my refuge and my fortress; my God, in Him I will trust.”</i> (verse 2)</p>This is the antechamber, the entranceway, into the complete protection of the remaining verses of that psalm. It is your testimony: <i>“I will say.”</i>  If you do not say it, you will not have it. And it takes some courage to say what follows in Psalm 91. But only those who say it have the scriptural right to live in it. It is the word of our testimony that makes it effective.',
