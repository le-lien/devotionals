    "body": 'In Jesus’ day, washing feet was a servant’s job. But not just any servant, the lowest of all the servants. No one wanted the job of washing feet. So it was the servant at the bottom of the totem pole who would be on his knees with the towel and the bowl of water.\nBut at the Passover meal, the One with the towel and the bowl of water was Jesus. The King of the universe was the One kneeling at their feet. The hands that had shaped the stars now washed away filth. Fingers that had formed mountains now rubbed toes. One day all nations will bow down before Him, but on that day He bowed before His disciples.\nHours before His own death on the cross, Jesus thought of only one thing. He wanted His disciples to know how much He loved them. He wasn’t just washing away dirt. He was washing away their doubts. ',
