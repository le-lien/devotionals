When your tummy is empty and so are your pockets?\nI know what we are doing. Nibbling on our nails like corn on the cob.\nPacing the floors. Wringing our hands.\nBut what does God do?\nHe fights for us. He steps in front of us, protects us with His presence, and takes over. “You will only need to remain calm. The Lord will fight for you” (Exodus 14:14).\nHis job is to fight. Our job is to trust. ',
