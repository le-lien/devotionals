    "body": 'Let’s look at some places in Scripture where the Greek word sozo—\nmeaning “salvation”—is used. In the gospel of Mark, Jesus met a blind man named Bartimaeus on the road to Jericho. (See Mark 10:46–\n52.) “Jesus answered and said to him, ‘What do you want Me to do for you?’ The blind man said to Him, ‘Rabboni, that I may receive my sight’”\n(Mark 10:51).\nThe blind beggar, Bartimaeus, had a one-track mind. All he wanted was to get his sight, and get it he did. “Then, Jesus said to him, ‘Go your way; your faith has made you well.’ And immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus on the road” (verse 52). The literal Greek translation of Jesus’ words reads, “Your faith has saved you.” That’s salvation.\nIn Luke 8:43–48, we read about the woman with the issue of blood who came behind Jesus and touched Him. She did not want to be recognized, however, because according to Jewish law, anyone with an issue of blood was unclean and was not free to touch anybody. This woman was embarrassed, but she was so desperate for healing that she defied the Law.\nNow when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling; and falling down before Him, she declared to Him in the presence of all the people the reason she had touched Him and how she was healed immediately. And He [Jesus] said to her,\n“Daughter, be of good cheer; your faith has made you well [sozo] .\nGo in peace.”\n(verses 47–48)\nHow wonderful! Being healed from blindness and from an issue of blood are both parts of salvation. ',
