As weighty as your backpack may be, perhaps the heaviest load we try to carry is the burden of mistakes and failures. What do you do with your failures?\nEven if you’ve fallen, even if you’ve failed, even if everyone else has rejected you, Christ will not turn away from you. He comes first and foremost to those who have no hope. He goes to those no one else would go to and says, “I’ll give you eternity.”\nOnly you can surrender your concerns to the Father. No one else can take those away and give them to God. Only you can put down your worries and leave them with the One who cares for you. What better way to start the day than by laying your cares at his feet? ',

Going over it constantly in your mind and telling yourself how dumb you are isn’t the answer. Put down that load. Let God carry it. His backpack is far bigger than yours.'
