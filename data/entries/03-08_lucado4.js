    "body": 'You hear a lot of people talk about God and about Jesus. But when it comes to the Holy Spirit, nobody says much. And sometimes the thought of a “spirit” can be confusing, maybe even frightening. But the truth is, we’re confused because no one has taught us about Him. And we’re frightened because we don’t understand Him.\nLet’s make things a bit simpler. The Holy Spirit is nothing to be afraid of\n—He is a gift from God. He is the presence of God living inside us, and He carries on the work of Jesus in our lives.\nThe Holy Spirit works in three ways: He helps our hearts by giving us the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22–24). He prays to God for us when we don’t know what to say (Romans 8:26). And He pours God’s love into our hearts (5:5).\nThe Holy Spirit is God living in you—and that is nothing to be frightened of! ',
