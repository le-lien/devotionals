    "body": 'God’s greatest blessings often come costumed as disasters. Any doubters need to do nothing more than ascend the hill of Calvary.\nJerusalem’s collective opinion that Friday was this: Jesus is finished.\nWhat other conclusion made sense? The religious leaders had turned him in. Rome had refused to bail him out. His followers had tucked their tails and scattered. He was nailed to a cross and left to die, which he did. They silenced his lips, sealed his tomb, and, as any priest worth the price of a phylactery would tell you, Jesus is history. Three years of power and promises are decomposing in a borrowed grave. Search the crucifixion sky for one ray of hope, and you won’t find it.\nSuch is the view of the disciples, the opinion of the friends, and the outlook of the enemies.\nBut God is not surprised. His plan is right on schedule. Even in—\nespecially in—death, Christ is still the king, the king over his own crucifixion. ',
