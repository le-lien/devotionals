Do you wish there was someone you could turn to for encouragement, for hope, for courage? There is. Jesus.\nTurn to Jesus and His love. When you feel like your friends have all left you. When you know you’ve messed up and you’re not sure how to make it right. Turn to Jesus. Ask Him to take away your confusion and guilt. Ask Him to show you the right thing to do. And trust Him to always love you and help you through the hard times. ',

      "text": 'Growing in Grace Zacchaeus climbed a tree to see Jesus. Four friends ripped open a roof to see Jesus. What will you do to see Jesus? Will you choose church over a ball game? Bible class over a movie? Prayer time over play time? Choose Jesus, and I promise you’ll be glad you did.'
