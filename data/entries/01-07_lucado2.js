    "body": 'The Israelites considered the name <i>Yahweh</i> too holy to be spoken by human lips. Whenever they needed to say <i>Yahweh</i>, they substituted the word <i>Adonai</i>, which means “Lord.” If the name needed to be written, the scribes would take a bath before they wrote it and destroy the pen afterward.\nThe name I AM sounds strikingly close to the Hebrew verb to <i>behavah</i>. It’s quite possibly a combination of the present tense form (I am) and the causative tense (I cause to be). <i>Yahweh</i>, then, seems to mean “I AM” and “I cause.” God is the “One who is” and the “One who causes.”\nWhy is that important? Because we need a big God. And if God is the “One who is,” then he is an unchanging God.',
