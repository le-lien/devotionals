    "body": 'The purpose of the Bible is simply to proclaim God’s plan to save his children. It tells us that we are lost and need to be saved. And it communicates the message that Jesus is God in human form sent to save his children.\nAlthough the Bible was written over sixteen centuries by at least forty authors, it has one central theme—salvation through faith in Christ. Begun by Moses in the lonely desert of Arabia and finished by John on the lonely isle of Patmos, it is held together by a strong thread: God’s passion and God’s plan to save his children.\nThis is important! Understanding the purpose of the Bible is like understanding how to read a GPS. When you know what you’re looking at and adjust your direction as needed, you’ll journey safely. But if you fail to pay attention to the coordinates, who knows where you’ll end up. If you want to know where you’re going, use God’s GPS for your life. Read your Bible every day. ',

      "text": 'We all have times when we’re not sure what to do or where to go. If you’re in the woods, it’s sure helpful to have a map or compass or GPS. But if you’re lost in life, the surest way to find your way again is to pull out your Bible. It’s the blueprint for getting to where you want to be.'
