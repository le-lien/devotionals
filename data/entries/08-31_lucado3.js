    "body": 'Fear, it seems, has moved into your bedroom and unpacked its things.\nOversized and rude, fear is unwilling to share the heart with happiness.\nHappiness obeys and leaves. Can one be happy and afraid at the same time?\nClear thinking and afraid? Confident and afraid? No. Fear is the bully in the school hallway: brash, loud, and unproductive. Fear herds us into detention and slams the doors.\nWouldn’t it be great to walk out?\nImagine your life untouched by angst. What if faith, not fear, was your first reaction to threats? If you could hover a fear magnet over your heart and extract every last shaving of dread, insecurity, and doubt, what would be left?\nEnvision a day, just one day, minus the fear of failure, rejection, and disaster.\nWalking into a class with a genuine, assured smile on your face. Taking the stage with no concerns about messing up. Picturing the future and knowing it’s going to be all right.\nJesus asks, “Why are you afraid?” (Matthew 8:26 NCV). He is your light and your salvation. Can you imagine a life with no fear?\nONE MORE THOUGHT\nWhen you become a Christian, it doesn’t mean nothing bad will ever happen to you.

That’s an unbeatable combination.\nSEPTEMBER\n“Come to Me, all you who labor and are\nheavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take\nMy yoke upon you and learn from Me, for\nI am gentle and lowly in heart, and you ',
