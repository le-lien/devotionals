    "body": 'Run away from sexual sin! No other sin so clearly affects the body as this one does. For sexual immorality is a sin against your own body” (1\nCorinthians 6:18 NLT). Paul wrote these words to Corinthians with a sex obsession.\nNo message swims more upstream than this one. You know the sexual anthem of our day: “I’ll do what I want. It’s my body.” God’s firm response?\n“No, it’s not. It’s mine.”\nBe quick to understand, God is not antisex. After all, he developed the whole package. He views sexual intimacy the way I view our family Bible.\nPassed down from my father’s side, it is one hundred years old and twelve inches thick. To me, beyond value. So when I need a step stool, I don’t reach for that Bible. If the foot of my bed breaks, I don’t use the family Bible as a prop. We reserve it for special times and keep it in a chosen place.\nRegard sex the same way—as a holy gift to be opened in a special place at special times. The special place is marriage, and the time is with your spouse. ',

      "text": 'The lure of physical attraction is a strong one. Young men and women (older ones too) have been dealing with it since, well, the beginning. Trust God on this one—the short-term pleasure isn’t worth the long-term consequences. If you find yourself in a tempting situation, take Paul’s advice: run!'
