He wants your praise in the lunchroom as well as in the Sunday-school room. He listens to you just as hard in math class as He does in Bible class. You may go days without thinking of Him, but there’s never a moment when He’s not thinking of you.\nPaul’s goal was to “capture every thought and make it give up and obey Christ” (2 Corinthians 10:5). Make that your goal too. Tell yourself what to think. Think about good things, about God and His gifts.\n“Never stop praying” (1 Thessalonians 5:17) and “let heaven fill your thoughts” (Colossians 3:2 TLB). ',
