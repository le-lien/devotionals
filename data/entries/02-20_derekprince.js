    "body": 'All has been settled by the blood of Jesus!\nI can well remember when I first began to make this kind of testimony.\nI thought, I wonder where the devil will hit me next.  I know of people who will not testify because they are afraid of what will happen when they do, but that is just playing the devil’s game. Remember, this is his way of keeping you from doing what will put you beyond his reach. It is only by the word of your testimony that you will get the benefits of the blood.\nThe first time you say it, all hell may break loose. Well, praise the Lord! Say it again. The Bible says, “Let us hold fast our confession”\n(Hebrews 4:14). And then, when everything really turns loose, Scripture says, “Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering”\n(Hebrews 10:23). Keep on saying it. It does not depend on our feelings.\nIt does not depend on our situations, symptoms, or circumstances. It is as eternally true as the Word of God.\nForever, God’s Word is settled in heaven. (See Psalm 119:89.) Satan has no place in us, no power over us, and no unsettled claims against us. ',
