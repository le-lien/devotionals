    "body": 'ne thing that can hinder our faith is a conscience that is seared. In contrast, there is a conscience that is so open to O the presence of God that the smallest thing in the world will drive it to God. When we can come into the presence of God with clear consciences and genuine faith, our hearts not condemning us, then we have confidence toward God (1 John 3:21), “and whatever we ask we receive from Him”  (v. 22).\n\nSugarcoating won‘t do. We must have reality, the real working of our God. We must know God. We must be able to go in and converse with God. We must also know the mind of God toward us, so that all our petitions are always in line with His will.\n\nAs this “like precious faith”  (2 Pet. 1:1) becomes a part of you, it will make you so that you will dare to do anything. And remember, God wants daring followers: people who will risk all, who will be strong in Him and willing to do exploits. How will we reach this place of faith? Give up your own mind. Let go of your own thoughts, and take the thoughts of God, the Word of God. If you build yourself on imaginations, you will go wrong. You have the Word of God, and it is enough.\n\nA man gave this remarkable testimony concerning the Word: "Never compare this Book with other books. Comparisons are dangerous. Never think or say that this Book contains the Word of God. It is the Word of God. It is supernatural in origin, eternal in duration, inexpressible in value, infinite in scope, regenerative in power, infallible in authority, universal in interest, personal in application, inspired in totality. Read it through. Write it down. Pray it in. Work it out. Then pass it on."',
