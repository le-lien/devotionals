    "body": 'Maybe your parents and siblings are the definition of a dysfunctional family: disagreements and divorce. Maybe you’ve seen raw evil: anger and abuse. And now you have to make a choice. Do you rise above the past and make a difference? Or do you remain controlled by the past and make excuses?\n“If only I’d been born somewhere else.” “If only I’d been treated fairly.”\nMaybe you’ve used those words. Maybe you have every right to use them. If so, go to John’s gospel and read Jesus’ words: “Human life comes from human parents, but spiritual life comes from the Spirit” (John 3:6 NCV).\nJesus understands your pain because he’s been there. He offers you an alternative to the humiliation and hurt. Love him. Live for him. Reach for him so you can hear the words he once spoke to a woman in misery: “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering”\n(Mark 5:34 NIV). ',
