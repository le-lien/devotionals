What we see as the ultimate tragedy, he sees as the ultimate triumph.\nAnd when a Christian dies, it’s not a time to despair, but a time to trust.\nJust as the seed is buried and the material wrapping decomposes, so our fleshly body will be buried and will decompose. But just as the buried seed sprouts new life, so our body will blossom into a new body… .\nThe seed buried in the earth will blossom in heaven. Your soul and body will reunite, and you will be like Jesus. ',
