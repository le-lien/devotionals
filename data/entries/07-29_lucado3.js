I’m not referring to French or German but to the day-to-day drama of your life.\nThere are times he speaks the “language of plenty.” Is your tummy full?\nIs your closet well stocked? Got a little jingle in your pocket? Don’t be so proud of what you have that you miss what you need to hear. Could it be you have much so you can give much?\nOr how about the “language of pain”? Talk about a dialect we try to avoid. But you and I both know how clearly God speaks in hospital hallways and sickbeds. When we’re in trouble, his words seem to take on new meaning and urgency. Is God telling you something through your struggles?\nGod speaks all languages—including yours. What language is God speaking to you?\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
