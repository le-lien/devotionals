What gives you a sense of satisfaction?\nSome long to feed the poor. Others enjoy leading the church… . Each of us has been made to serve God in a unique way… .\nThe longings of your heart, then, are not incidental; they are critical messages. The desires of your heart are not to be ignored; they are to be consulted. As the wind turns the weather vane, so God uses your passions to turn your life. God is too gracious to ask you to do something you hate. ',
