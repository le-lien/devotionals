Take a look at his creation. Curious about his strength? Pay a visit to his home address: 1 Billion Starry Sky Avenue.\nHe is untainted by the atmosphere of sin, unbridled by the time line of history, unhindered by the weariness of the body.\nWhat controls you doesn’t control him. What troubles you doesn’t trouble him. What fatigues you doesn’t fatigue him. Is an eagle disturbed by traffic? No, he rises above it. Is the whale perturbed by a hurricane? Of course not, he plunges beneath it. Is the lion flustered by the mouse standing directly in his way? No, he steps over it.\nHow much more is God able to soar above, plunge beneath, and step over the troubles of the earth! ',
