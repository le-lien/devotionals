    "body": 'Blind ambition. Success at all cost. Becoming a legend in one’s own time. Climbing the ladder to the top. King of the mountain. Top of the heap.\n“I did it my way.”\nWe make heroes out of people who are ambitious. We hold them up as models for our kids and put their pictures on the covers of our magazines.\nAnd rightly so. This world would be in sad shape without people who dream of touching the heavens. Ambition is that grit in the soul which creates disenchantment with the ordinary and puts the dare into dreams.\nBut left unchecked it becomes an insatiable addiction to power and prestige; a roaring hunger for achievement that devours people as a lion devours an animal, leaving behind only the skeletal remains of relationships… .\nGod won’t tolerate it… . Blind ambition is a giant step away from God and one step closer to catastrophe. ',
