These are not made-up fairy tales.\nThese are actual moments in history when a real God helped real people in real pain so we could answer the question, “Where is God when I hurt?”\nHow does God react to broken dreams? Read the story of Jairus and his dying daughter (Luke 8:40–56). How does God feel about those who are sick? Picture yourself at the pool of Bethesda as He heals the crippled man (John 5:1–9). Do you wish God would speak to your lonely heart? Then listen as He speaks to the disciples on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24:13–\n35).\nHe’s not doing it just for them. He’s doing it for me. He’s doing it for you.\nThe God who spoke to them still speaks. The God who came to them still comes. He comes into your world. He comes to do what you can’t. ',
