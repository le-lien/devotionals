    "body": 'According to Jesus our decisions have a thermostatic impact on the unseen world. Our actions on the keyboard of earth trigger hammers on the piano strings of heaven. Our obedience pulls the ropes which ring the bells in heaven’s belfries. Let a child call and the ear of the Father inclines… .\nAnd, most important, let a sinner repent, and every other activity ceases, and every heavenly being celebrates… .\nWe don’t always share such enthusiasm, do we? When you hear of a soul saved, do you drop everything and celebrate? Is your good day made better or your bad day salvaged? We may be pleased—but exuberant? … When a soul is saved, the heart of Jesus becomes the night sky on the Fourth of July, radiant with explosions of cheer.\nCan the same be said about us? ',
