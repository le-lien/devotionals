    "body": 'Look at what Jesus did for us. He swapped the royalty of heaven for the poorness and hardship of earth. Sometimes He slept on borrowed blankets; sometimes it was the cold, hard earth. He depended on the handouts of others. He was sometimes so hungry that He would eat raw grain from the fields or pick fruit off a tree. He knew what it meant to be homeless. He was laughed at. His neighbors tried to kill Him. Some called Him crazy. Sometimes even His friends turned against Him.\nHe was arrested for a crime that He didn’t do. People were hired to lie about it. The jury had their minds made up before He was even arrested.\nAnd the judge—who was more interested in politics than in truth—ordered Him to His death.\nThey killed Jesus. And why? Because He came to give us a gift that only He could give—salvation. ',
