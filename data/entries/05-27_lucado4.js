    "body": 'Jesus didn’t act unless He saw His Father act. He didn’t judge until He heard His Father judge. He never did or said anything without His Father’s guidance.\nBecause Jesus could hear what others couldn’t—His Father’s voice—He acted differently than they did. Do you remember in the Bible when everyone was troubled about the man born blind? Jesus wasn’t. He knew that the blindness would reveal God’s power (John 9:3). Remember the time when everyone was upset about Lazarus’s illness and death? Jesus wasn’t. It was as if Jesus could hear the thoughts of His Father telling Him that Lazarus would live. ',

You hear so much more when you are still and quiet and listening. You can hear your Father when you are “quiet and know that [He is] God” (Psalm 46:10).'
