Select a slot on your schedule and a corner of your world, and claim it for God. For some it may be the best to do this in the morning… . Others prefer the evening… .\nA second tool you need [is] an open Bible. God speaks to us through his Word. The first step in reading the Bible is to ask God to help you understand it. . . . Don’t go to Scripture looking for your own idea; go searching for God’s… .\nThere is a third tool… . Not only do we need a regular time and an open Bible, we also need a listening heart… . If you want to be just like Jesus, let God have you. Spend time listening for him until you receive your lesson for the day—then apply it. ',
