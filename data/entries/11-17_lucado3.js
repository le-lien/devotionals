They were at sea on a stormy night when a figure came to them, walking on the water. It wasn’t what they expected.\nPerhaps they were looking for angels to descend or heaven to open. We don’t know what they were looking for. But one thing is for sure, they weren’t looking for Jesus to come walking on the water. And since Jesus came in a way they didn’t expect, they almost missed seeing the answer to their prayers.\nUnless we look and listen closely, we risk making the same mistake. Are tidal waves of trouble threatening to overturn the boat of your life? God is on his way. His lights in our dark nights are as numerous as the stars, if only we’ll look for them. ',
