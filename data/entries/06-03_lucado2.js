    "body": 'We pay a high price for … self-obsession. “God isn’t pleased at being ignored” (Rom. 8:8 MSG). Paul speaks of sinners when he describes those who “knew God, but they wouldn’t worship him as God. . . . So God let them go ahead and do whatever shameful things their hearts desired” (Rom.\n1:21, 24 NASB).\nYou’ve seen the chaos. The husband ignoring his wife. The dictator murdering the millions. Grown men seducing the young. The young propositioning the old. When you do what you want, and I do what I want, and no one gives a lick as to what God wants, humanity implodes. The infection of the person leads to the corruption of the populace… .\nExtract God; expect earthly chaos and, many times worse, expect eternal misery. ',
