    "body": 'Let’s go back in history a couple of thousand years. Let’s go to Rome, to a shabby little room surrounded by high walls. Inside there is a man seated on the floor. He’s an older fellow. His shoulders droop down, and his head is balding. Chains are on his hands and feet.\nThis is the apostle Paul. He once followed the will of God wherever it would take him. Now he is stuck in a run-down house and chained to a Roman soldier.\nHe is writing a letter. Is he writing to God to tell Him how badly he has been treated? Is he making a list of everything that is wrong? Paul has every reason to whine and complain. But he isn’t. Instead, Paul is writing a letter to the Philippians that—even some two thousand years later—is known as the letter of joy. ',

      "text": 'Growing in Grace Pretend that you are like Paul and are writing a letter about your life. Will you complain about everything that is not going your way? Or will you write about all your blessings? Can you make your letter be a “letter of joy”?'
