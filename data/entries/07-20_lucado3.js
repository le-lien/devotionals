He’s so much more than that.\nOur questions show how little we understand him: How can God be everywhere at one time? (Who says God is bound by a body?) How can God hear all the prayers that come to him? (Perhaps his ears are different from ours.) How can God be the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit? (Could it be that heaven has a different set of physics than earth?) If people down here won’t forgive us, how much more are we guilty before a holy God? (Oh, just the opposite. God is always able to give grace when we humans can’t—he invented it.)\nThe moment you begin to think God wouldn’t . . . God won’t . . . God can’t, stop and think again. He’s bigger, stronger, more powerful, and more loving than you’ll ever know. Put him in the largest box you can imagine?\nNot a chance. He’ll never fit.\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
