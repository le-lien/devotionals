But only when he saves you will you worship him.\nIt’s a “before-and-after” deal. Before your rescue, you could easily keep God at a distance. Sure, he was important, but so was a lot of stuff. Friends.\nFamily. Grades. Swim team. Spanish club.\nThen came the storm … the rage … the fight … the ripped moorings…\n. Despair fell like a fog; your bearings were gone. In your heart, you knew there was no exit. Did you turn to your friends and family for help? They could only do so much. Lean on your skills for strength? The storm wasn’t impressed with your talent.\nSuddenly you were left with one option. The One worthy of your love and praise. The One who deserves your worship. Who is it? The One and only God.\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
