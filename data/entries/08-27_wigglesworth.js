After the Holy Spirit takes charge of you, He is the Comforter who brings thoughts and language to your life, and it is amazing.\n\nIf we get to the place where we take no thought for ourselves, then God takes thought for us; but as long as we are taking thought for ourselves, we are somewhat hindered in this divine order with God. Taking no thought for yourself, no   desire for your human self, not seeking anything for your human condition but that God will be glorified in your body and spirit and that He will be the chief Worker on every line—this is divine appointment. This is holy order.\n\nThere is a holy order. There are sects today that call themselves "holy orders," but the only holy order is where God has so permeated your nature that the Trinity comes and blends perfectly with your human nature. Where the human nature could not help itself, God turned the captivity of the wheels of nature and poured in His divine power until the nature itself became divine property.',
