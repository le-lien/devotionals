You can’t take the heat out of fire and still have fire.\nIn the same way, you can’t take the love out of God and still have God.\nFor He was and is … love.\nSearch deep within Him. Explore every corner of His Word. Peek into every angle. Love is all you will find. Go to the very beginning of Genesis, and you’ll find it. Go to every story of every Bible hero, and you’ll find it.\nGo all the way to the end of Revelation, and you’ll see it.\nLove. ',

On a piece of paper, draw a heart and write some of those verses in it. Be sure to add John 3:16, the greatest “love” verse of all.'
