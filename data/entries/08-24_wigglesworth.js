    "body": 'hat will the Holy Spirit do? The Holy Spirit is prophetic. He says, “Be of good cheer”  (John 16:33); “Take My yoke W upon you and learn from Me”  (Matt. 11:29); “Have peace with one another”  (Mark 9:50). You say, "But that is what Jesus said." It is what the Holy Spirit is taking and revealing to us. The Holy Spirit is the spokesman in these days, and He speaks the Word. The Holy Spirit takes the words of Jesus, and He is so full of truth that He never adds anything to them. He gives you the un-adulterated Word of Truth, the Word of Life.\n\nWhat are His words? Truths like these: “I am the light of the world”  (John 8:12); “For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved”  (John 3:17); and “Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest”  (Matt. 11:28). The Holy Spirit takes these words and gives them to you.\n\nThe Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Truth, is bringing forth the Word of Life. “I will give you rest.”  Rest? Oh, there is no rest like it! It can come in your moment of greatest trial.\n\nWhen my dear wife was lying dead, the doctors could do nothing, and they said to me, "She is done; we cannot help you." My heart was so moved, and I said, "O God, I can‘t spare her!"\n\nI went up to her and I said, "Oh, come back, come back and speak to me. Come back, come back!"\n\nAnd the Spirit of the Lord moved, and she came back and smiled again.\n\nThen the Holy Spirit said to me, "She is mine. Her work is done; she is mine."\n\nOh, the comforting word! No one else could have done it, but the Comforter came. At that moment, my dear wife passed away.',
