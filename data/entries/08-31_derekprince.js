    "body": 'Let us review a central truth illustrated in the parable of the prodigal son, which Jesus related to His disciples in Luke 15:11–32. The father was out there looking for his boy to bring him back home. Other people did not have to come and say, “Your son’s come home!” because the first one to know it was the father. He knew it before the rest of the family found out.\nGod’s attitude toward us in Christ is like that. We are not rejects.\nWe are not second-class citizens. We are not just servants. When the prodigal came back, he was willing to be a servant. But his father would not hear of it. On the contrary, he said,\nBring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet. And bring the fatted calf here and kill it, and let us eat and be merry; for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.\n(verses 22 –24)\nThe whole household was turned upside down to welcome the prodigal.\nLikewise, Jesus said,  “There will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent”  (verse 7 niv). That’s how God welcomes us in Christ. ',
