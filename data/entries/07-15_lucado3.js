    "body": 'Parents. They’ve controlled your life for so long. They still do. But now you’re older, wiser, more mature. You need them to let go a little. You want to honor them, but they’re driving you crazy!\nI am a son and a parent, so I see both sides of the coin. As a son, I too wanted more freedom and the chance to make my own decisions. As a parent, I understand fearing that our children will make the wrong decisions and longing to protect them from the mean ol’ world. So what do you do?\nThe Bible says, “Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right”\n(Ephesians 6:1 NIV). As long as your mom and dad aren’t asking you to go against what God desires, you are called to obedience. Tough sometimes, but true.\nThis doesn’t mean you can’t talk to them about your concerns and frustrations. They were teens once themselves. After a bit of gentle prodding, they may remember—and let go just a little more. ',
