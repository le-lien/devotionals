    "body": 'Jesus visits two sisters. One, Mary, drops everything to sit at his feet. The other, Martha, scurries about, trying to tidy the house and prepare a meal for their distinguished guest. And she’s not happy about it. “Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me alone to do all the work?” (Luke 10:40 NCV).\nMartha’s life was cluttered. She needed a break. “Martha, Martha, you are worried and upset about many things,” the Master explained to her. “Only one thing is important. Mary has chosen [it]” (Luke 10:41–42 NCV).\nDo you need a break? Are you hurrying through life, trying to impress others or even God? There’s nothing wrong with trying to earn top grades, with doing your best in band, baseball, and the science club. But if the only reason you do it is to impress the world, let it go. Choose instead to sit at the feet of Christ. God is more pleased with the quiet attention of a sincere servant than the noisy service of a sour one.\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
