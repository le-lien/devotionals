What held him to that cross was his conviction that it was necessary that he become sin—that he who is pure become sin and that the wrath of God be poured down, not upon the creation, but upon the Creator.\nWhen the one who knew no sin became sin for us, when the sinless one was covered with all the sins of all the world, God didn’t call his army of angels to save him. He didn’t, because he knew he would rather give up his Son than give up on us.\nRegardless of what you’ve done, it’s not too late. Regardless of how far you’ve fallen, it’s not too late. It doesn’t matter how low the mistake is, it’s not too late to dig down, pull out that mistake, and then let it go—and be free.\nWhat makes a Christian a Christian is not perfection but forgiveness.
