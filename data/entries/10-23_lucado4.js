If you think we are hateful to each other now, imagine the world without the Holy Spirit. If you think there is loneliness and sadness and guilt now, imagine life without the touch of Jesus.\nNo forgiveness. No hope. No acts of kindness. No words of love. No more food given in His name. No more songs sung to His praise. No more good deeds done in His honor. If God took away His angels, His grace, His promise of eternal life, and His servants, what would the world be like?\nIn a word: empty. I’d much rather have a world full of Jesus.\nGrowing in Grace ',
