    "body": 'For some of you, the journey has been long. Very long and stormy.\nIn no way do I wish to minimize the difficulties that you have had to face along the way. Some of you have shouldered burdens that few of us could ever carry. You have bid farewell to life-long partners. You have been robbed of life-long dreams. You have been given bodies that can’t sustain your spirit. You have spouses who can’t tolerate your faith. You have bills that outnumber the paychecks and challenges that outweigh the strength.\nAnd you are tired.\nIt’s hard for you to see the City in the midst of the storms. The desire to pull over to the side of the road and get out entices you. You want to go on, but some days the road seems so long… .\nLet me encourage you. . . . God never said that the journey would be easy, but he did say that the arrival would be worthwhile. ',
