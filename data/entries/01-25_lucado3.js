    "body": 'The wilderness can be a dark and lonely place. In the wilderness you think the unthinkable. Jesus did. He was “in the wilderness for forty days, being tempted by the devil” (Luke 4:1–2 NASB). I wonder if wild ideas crossed his mind. Teaming up with Satan? Becoming a dictator instead of a Savior?\nTorching Earth and starting over on Pluto? We don’t know what he thought.\nWe just know this: he was tempted.\n“We are tempted by our own desires that drag us off and trap us” (James 1:14 CEV). What was unimaginable prior to the wilderness becomes possible in it. Gossiping. Cheating. Humiliating a friend. Drugs. Drinking. Sex.\nPornography. Suicide. When your world is so dark that you can’t see the way out, you give thought to the unthinkable.\nHow to avoid the trap of temptation? Rely on the Word of God. He “will show you how to escape from your temptations” (1 Corinthians 10:13 CEV).\nListen hard for his voice, and leave the wilderness behind. ',
