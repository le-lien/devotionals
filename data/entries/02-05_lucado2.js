How long must I put up with you?” (Mark 9:19).\nHow long must I put up with you?\n“Long enough to be called crazy by my brothers and a liar by my neighbors. Long enough to be run out of my town and my Temple… .”\nHow long?  “Until the rooster sings and the sweat stings and the mallet rings and a hillside of demons smirk at a dying God.”\nHow long?  “Long enough for every sin to so soak my sinless soul that heaven will turn in horror until my swollen lips pronounce the final transaction: ‘It is finished.’”\nHow long?  “Until it kills me.” ',
