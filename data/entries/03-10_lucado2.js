    "body": 'Early Christians were urged to\n• “pray without ceasing” (1 Thess. 5:17 NASB);\n• “always be prayerful” (Rom. 12:12 NLT);\n• “pray at all times and on every occasion” (Eph. 6:18 NLT).\nSound burdensome? Are you wondering, My business needs attention, my children need dinner, my bills need paying. How can I stay in a place of prayer?\nDo this. Change your definition of prayer. Think of prayers less as an activity for God and more as an awareness of God. Seek to live in uninterrupted awareness. Acknowledge his presence everywhere you go. As you stand in line to register your car, think, Thank you, Lord, for being here.\nIn the grocery as you shop, Your presence, my King, I welcome.  As you wash the dishes, worship your Maker. ',
