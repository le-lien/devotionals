    "body": 'Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, whom He has redeemed from the hand of the enemy.\n(Psalm 107:2)\nSome people may know that they were redeemed out of the hand of the devil; others do not. But I know full well where I was before Jesus came into my life; I have no doubt about it. I know what it is like to be in the devil’s hand, and I never want to be there again. I also know, by what Scripture says, that it was the blood of Jesus that got me out of the hand of the devil and into the hand of the Good Shepherd.\nJesus said of His people, “I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand”  (John 10:28 kjv). That was the transfer from the devil’s hand to the hand of the Lord.\nBut notice that this transfer is effective and able to benefit us only when we do one thing: when we “say so.” “Let the redeemed of the Lord say so.”  If you are redeemed, say it! If you do not say it, your redemption is not effective. It is the word of your testimony that makes the blood effective.\nThank You, Lord, for the blood of Jesus. I declare that by His blood, I have been transferred from the enemy’s hand to the hand of the Lord. Through the blood of Jesus, I am redeemed out of the hand of the devil. Amen. ',
