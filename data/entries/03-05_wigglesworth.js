    "body": 'In Peter‘s life, we see evidences of the spiritual power that he had attained, but we see also the natural power working. I Jesus saw that He must suffer if He would reach the spiritual life that God intended Him to reach. So Jesus said, "I must go forward. Your words, Peter, are an offense to Me" (Matt. 16:23). If you to seek to save yourself, it is an offense to God. God has been impressing on me more and more that if at any time I were to seek man‘s favor or earthly power, I would lose favor with God and could not have faith.\n\nGod is speaking to us, every one of us, trying to get us to leave the shoreline. There is only one place where we can have the mind and will of God; it is alone with God. If we look to anybody else, we cannot get it. If we seek to save ourselves, we will never reach the place where we will be able to bind and loose. (See Matthew 16:19.) There is a close companionship between you and Jesus that nobody knows about, where every day you have to choose or refuse.\n\nIt is in the narrow way that you get the power to bind and the power to loose. I know that Jesus was separated from His own family and friends. He was deprived of the luxuries of life. It seems to me that God wants to get every one of us separated to Himself in this holy war, and we are not going to have faith if we do not give ourselves wholly to Him. Beloved, it is in these last days that I cannot have the power I want to have unless, as a sheep, I am willing to shear myself. The way is narrow. (See Matthew 7:13–14.) Beloved, you will not be able to bind and loose if you have sin in you. There is not one person who is able to deal with the sins of others if he is not free himself. “He breathed on them, and said to them, „Receive the Holy Spirit‟”  (John 20:22). Jesus knew the Holy Spirit would give them both a revelation of themselves and a revelation of God. He must reveal to you your depravity.\n\nDo you believe that the Father in heaven would make you a judge over a kingdom if there were anything crooked in you? Do 113\n\nyou believe you will be able to bind unless you are free yourself? But everyone who has this living Christ within him has the power that will put to death all sin.\n\nWith Jesus‘ last words on earth, He gave the disciples a com-mission. (See Mark 16:15–18.) The need for discipleship has never ceased. Some churches are weak today because Christ the Rock is not abiding in them in the manifestations of the power of God. This is not because it is a special gift—this power to bind and loose—but it is contingent on whether you have the rock foundation in you. In the name of Jesus, you will loose, and in the name of Jesus, you will bind. If He is in you, you ought to bring forth evidences of that power.\n\nOne can see that Peter had great sympathy, and he did not want Jesus to be crucified. It was perfectly natural for Peter to say what he did, but Jesus said,  “Get behind Me”  (Matt. 16:23). He knew He must not be turned aside by any human sympathy. The only way we can retain our humility is to stay on this narrow line and say, "Get behind me, Satan."\n\nBeloved, we are now living in the experience of the fact that Jesus is the Rock. I am glad, for we are within reach of wonderful possibilities because of the Rock. Take a stand on the fact that the Rock cannot be overthrown.',
