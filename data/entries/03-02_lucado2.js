    "body": 'Anger. It’s a peculiar yet predictable emotion. It begins as a drop of water. An irritant. A frustration. Nothing big, just an aggravation. Someone gets your parking place. Someone pulls in front of you on the freeway. A waitress is slow and you are in a hurry. The toast burns. Drops of water.\nDrip. Drip. Drip. Drip.\nYet, get enough of these seemingly innocent drops of anger and before long you’ve got a bucket full of rage. Walking revenge. Blind bitterness… .\nNow, is that any way to live? What good has hatred ever brought? What hope has anger ever created? What problems have ever been resolved by revenge? ',
