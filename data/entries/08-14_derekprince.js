    "body": 'Why are we here on earth? It is not to do our own will, but rather to do the will of Christ, who commissioned us. Paul wrote in Colossians 1:9, “For this reason we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding.”  We are to be filled with the knowledge of God’s will. In other words, the knowledge of Christ’s will is to take over the whole of our minds. It is to completely control our thinking. Every motive and every intention is to be controlled by the knowledge of the will of Christ.\nPaul continued in Colossians 4:12,  “Epaphras, who is one of you, a bondservant of Christ, greets you, always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.”\nThe believer becomes perfect and complete only insofar as he fulfills the whole will of God. Hebrews 13 states this truth beautifully: Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do his will.\n(Hebrews 13:20–21 kjv)\nWe are made perfect and complete, we come to fulfillment, only insofar as we do the will of God, just as Jesus found fulfillment during His earthly life only in doing the will of God.\nIf there is disharmony, frustration, or emotional tumult in your life, consider checking your relationship to the will of God, for you can be made perfect only insofar as you know and do the will of God.\nAnything else will bring only incompleteness and frustration.
