It is a sign that you are intelligent—or at least that’s what the world says.\nJesus believed in tolerance too. But for Jesus, tolerance meant being kind to those who didn’t understand His truth. And it meant helping them to understand. For example, He was tolerant of the disciples when they doubted, He was tolerant of the crowds when they misunderstood, and He is tolerant of us when we sin.\nBut there is one thing about which Jesus was not—and is not—tolerant.\nHe is not tolerant about other ideas of how to get to heaven.\nSome people believe if they do enough good things, or if they are strong enough or brave enough, they’ll get to heaven. Others believe there are many different ways to heaven. But the truth is that there is only one way to heaven—by believing in and obeying Jesus. ',
