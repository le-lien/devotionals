Then he continued with, “And I will make him/her _________, _________ and _________ and ____________ and __________.” Fill those blanks with your characteristics. Insightful. Clever. Detail oriented. Restless. And since you are God’s idea, you are a good idea. What God said about Jeremiah, he said about you: “Before I made you in your mother’s womb, I chose you.\nBefore you were born, I set you apart for a special work.”\nSet apart for a special work. ',
