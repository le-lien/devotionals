    "body": 'The word holy  means “to separate.” The word’s meaning can be traced back to ancient times, when it meant “to cut.” To be holy, then, is to be a cut above … better than the rest … extraordinary. That’s God. He is a cut above us. What scares us does not scare Him. What troubles us does not trouble Him.\nI’m not a great sailor, but I’ve been in a fishing boat enough times to know how to find land in a storm. You don’t aim at another boat—it might float the wrong way. Don’t stare at the waves—they’re always moving. Set your sights on something that isn’t moved by the wind—like a light on the shore—and go straight toward it.\nWhen life is stormy, don’t follow your friends—they might go the wrong way. Don’t stare at your troubles—they’re always moving. Set your sights on the One who never moves—God. He is “a cut above” any storm. ',

      "text": 'Does it matter what you set your sights on? Try this: Grab a football or soccer ball and pick a distant object (like a tree) as your goal. Throw the ball at the goal, but don’t look at it. Look to the right or left. Miss your goal? Try again, this time keeping your eyes on the goal. Better? Always keep your eyes on the goal—and on God!'
