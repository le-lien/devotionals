How far is the shepherd from the sheep (John 10:14)? The branch from the vine (John 15:5)? That’s how far God is from you. He is near. See how these four words look taped to your bathroom mirror: “God is for me” (Ps. 56:9 NKJV).\nAnd his kingdom needs you. The poor need you; the lonely need you; the church needs you . . . the cause of God needs you. You are part of “the overall purpose he is working out in everything and everyone” (Eph. 1:11\nMSG). The kingdom needs you to discover and deploy your unique skill.\nUse it to make much out of God. Get the word out. God is with us; we are not alone. ',
