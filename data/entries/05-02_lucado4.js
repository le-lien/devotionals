Peter grabbed the edge of the boat. He threw out one leg and then followed with the other leg. Several steps were taken. It was if an invisible pathway of rocks ran under his feet. At the end of the path was the glowing face of an “I’ll-never-give-up-on-you” Friend\n—Jesus.\nWe do the same thing, don’t we? We try to do it all on our own—to fix our own problems and even to earn our own way to heaven. We only pray to Jesus when we realize that we need Him. When we realize we can never save ourselves, we call out to Him and beg Him to save us. ',
