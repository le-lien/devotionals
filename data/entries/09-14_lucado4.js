    "body": 'What if someone made a movie about your hands? What would we see?\nEveryone’s movie would start much the same, with an infant’s fist, then a close-up of a tiny hand wrapped around Mom’s finger. Then what? Holding on to a chair as you learned to walk?\nIf you showed the movie to your friends, you’d be proud of some moments: your hands holding out a gift, patting a friend on the back, helping up someone who’s fallen, taking food to the sick. But then there are other scenes. Hands taking instead of giving, snatching instead of offering, hitting instead of helping. ',

      "title": 'Oh, the power of our hands! Leave them uncontrolled, and they become weapons: clawing, scratching, and snatching for our own selfish wants. But control them and our hands become tools of grace and kindness—not just tools in the hands of God, but God’s very own hands.',
      "text": 'Growing in Grace When Jesus was walking among us, He could touch the sick and the lonely, feed the poor. But now He uses your hands instead. In Matthew 25:40, Jesus said, “Anything you did for any of my people here, you also did for me.” What can you do for Jesus today?'
