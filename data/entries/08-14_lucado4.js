The problem is, I’m not the best singer, so it would not give the same joy and satisfaction to those listening to me.\nPaul gave good advice in Romans 12:3: “Do not think that you are better than you are. You must see yourself as you really are.”\nIn other words, know your strengths. Know your talents. Know what you are good at. When you help in the nursery, do the toddlers follow your every step? You may be a teacher. When you offer to serve, do other kids follow your example? You may be a leader. Where are you able to do the most good for God? Find out your strengths, and then focus on them.
