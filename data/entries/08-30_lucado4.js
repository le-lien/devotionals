    "body": 'Have you ever seen a courtroom scene on television? One where a witness is telling the court what he has seen or heard? We are witnesses too. And we are called to testify just like witnesses in a courtroom. We are to tell others what we have seen and heard about Jesus.\nOur job is not to stretch the truth or make things seem different from what they are. Our job is to tell the truth. Period.\nThere is, however, one difference between the witness in court and the witness for Christ. Sooner or later, the witness in court will step down from the witness chair. He will be finished. But as a witness for Christ, you never step down. You are never finished.\nBecause the promises of Jesus are always on trial, you must always be a witness. You must always tell the world who He is, what He has done for you, and what He wants to do for the world. ',
