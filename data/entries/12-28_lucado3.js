She canned her own and stored them in an underground cellar near her West Texas house. It was a deep hole with wooden steps, plywood walls, and a musty smell. As a youngster I used to climb in, close the door, and see how long I could last in the darkness. I would sit silently, listening to my breath and heartbeats, until I couldn’t take it anymore and then would race up the stairs and throw open the door. Light would avalanche into the cellar. What a change! Moments before I couldn’t see anything—all of a sudden I could see everything.\nJust as light poured into the cellar, God’s hope pours into your world. Upon the sick, he shines the ray of healing. To the lonely, he gives the promise of relationship. To the confused, he offers the light of Scripture.\nWhen you have God, you always have hope.',

      "text": '“I hope we win the game tonight.” “I hope I pass my final tomorrow.” We often use the word <i>hope</i> as a wish for something to happen. But <i>hope</i> in God is something far deeper. It’s knowing that he’s in control, that he loves us, and that our future is secure in him.'
