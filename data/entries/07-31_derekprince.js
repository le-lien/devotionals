    "body": 'For he [God]  chose us in him [Christ]  before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love he predestined us to be adopted as his sons through Jesus Christ.\n(Ephesians 1:4–5 niv)\nThere are two possible ways of punctuating the above verse: “to be holy and blameless in his sight in love…” or “to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love….” Whichever period placement you use, the fact remains that God’s love precedes time. Before the creation of the world, God loved us, chose us, and predestined us. He arranged the course of His life so that we would encounter Him and experience His love.\nThere is a very simple statement in the Song of Solomon that says,\n“Love is as strong as death” (8:6). Death is inevitable. When death comes, nobody can turn it away. Nobody can say, “I’m not ready. I won’t accept you.” No man has the power to resist death.\nBut the New Testament takes us one step further. When Jesus died and rose again from the dead, He proved that love is stronger than death.\nThe most irresistible, negative force in the universe was conquered by the most irresistible, positive force in the universe—the love of God.\nLove always achieves its objectives; it is invincible. It accepts no barriers.\nIt will get past every obstacle in order to get to where it wants to go.\nGod’s love is individual and everlasting. It precedes time; it is irresistible. Then, picture yourself as the pearl in the hand of Jesus. Say to yourself, “His love for me is individual and everlasting. It precedes time. It is irresistible.” Then, remember what it cost Him—all He had.\nStop to tell Him, “Thank You.” ',
