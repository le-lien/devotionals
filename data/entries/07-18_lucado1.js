Call to mind the orphans in Bangladesh or the abandoned in New Delhi, and you will see what people saw when they passed Bethesda.\nAs they passed, what did they hear? An endless wave of groans. What did they witness? A field of faceless need. What did they do? Most walked past.\n…\nBut not Jesus… .\nHe is alone… . The people need him—so he’s there. Can you picture it?\nJesus walking among the suffering… .\nLittle do they know that God is walking slowly, stepping carefully between the beggars and the blind. ',
