    "body": 'In some ways, living a Christian life is like climbing a great wall. The wall is high, and the risk is higher. You take your first step up the day you confess Jesus as the Son of God. He gives you His safety harness—the Holy Spirit. He hands you a rope—His Word.\nYour first steps up are sure and strong. But as the climb goes on, you become tired. And as you climb higher, you become afraid. You lose your focus. You lose your grip, and you fall. You do that thing you know you shouldn’t do. And for a moment—which seems like forever—you fall.\nTumbling wildly. Dizzy. Out of control.\nBut then the rope tightens, and the fall stops. You hang there in the safety harness and find that it is strong. You hold on to the rope and trust it to hold you up. And although you can’t see your Guide, you know Him—Jesus. He is strong. And He is able to keep you from falling. ',

      "text": 'Falling can be frightening—a tummy-tightening, teeth-gritting terror. Unless you’re on one of those giant, bouncy inflatables! Next time you’re bouncing around, think about that tummy-tightening fall—and then about how wonderful it is to bounce back up again. Just as God lifts you up again when you fall into sin.'
