    "body": 'Have you read Genesis 3? That’s the chapter about the entry of evil into the world. Disaster came in the form of Lucifer, the fallen angel. And as long as Satan “prowls around like a roaring lion” (1 Peter 5:8 NIV), he will wreak havoc among God’s people. He will lock preachers, like Paul, in prisons. He will afflict the friends of Jesus, like Lazarus, with diseases. He will assault you with the lie that no one loves you.\nYet Satan’s strategies will backfire. The imprisoned Paul will write books of the Bible. The cemetery of Lazarus will become a stage for one of Christ’s greatest miracles. And you will learn that God loves you more than you can imagine. Intended evil becomes ultimate good.\nWe can be thankful that the tricks of the devil will always be trumped by the “treat” of a God who “will rescue me from every evil deed and bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom” (2 Timothy 4:18 ESV).
