That’s what grace is… .\nGrace is something you did not expect. It is something you certainly could never earn. But grace is something you’d never turn down.\nYou know what happens when someone sees the grace of God? When someone really tastes the forgiving and liberating grace of God? Some one who tastes God’s grace is the hardest worker, the most morally pure individual, and the person most willing to forgive. ',
