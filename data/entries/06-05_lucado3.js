    "body": 'Two words sum up Christ’s opinion of worry: irrelevant and irreverent.\n“Can all your worries add a single moment to your life?” (Matthew 6:27 NLT). Of course not. Worry is irrelevant. It changes nothing. When was the last time you solved a problem by worrying about it? Imagine someone saying, “I got behind in my homework, so I decided to worry my way out of it. And, you know, it worked! A few sleepless nights, a day of puking and hand wringing, and—glory to worry—the finished assignments just appeared on my desk.”\nIt doesn’t happen! Worry changes nothing. You don’t add one day to your life or one bit of life to your day by worrying. Your anxiety earns you a stomachache, nothing more.\nNinety-two percent of our worries are needless. Not only is worry irrelevant, doing nothing; worry is irreverent, distrusting God.\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
