We act like those who are “good people” will see God. Those who try hard will get into heaven. We pretend that we’re good if we don’t do anything too terrible. And we hope that our goodness is enough to get us into heaven.\nThat may sound right to us, but it doesn’t sound right to God. God says,\n“You must be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect” (Matthew 5:48).\nYou see, in God’s plan, we have to be perfect. We can’t compare ourselves to others. They are just as messed up as we are. The goal is to be like God—perfect. Anything else is just not good enough. Thankfully, God knows that we can’t be perfect. So He sent His Son to be perfect for us. ',
