They had never, as a group, done that before. Never. Check it out. Open your Bible. Search for a time when the disciples corporately praised him.\nYou won’t find it.\nYou won’t find them worshiping when he heals the leper. Forgives the adulteress. Preaches to the masses. They were willing to follow. Willing to leave family. Willing to cast out demons. Willing to be in the army.\nBut only after the incident on the sea did they worship him. Why?\nSimple. This time they were the ones who were saved. ',
