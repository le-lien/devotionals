    "body": 'Imet a teenager at the café where she works. She’s fresh out of high school.\nWhen she was fifteen, her divorced parents remarried, only to divorce again a few months ago. Recently her parents told her to make a choice: live with Mom or Dad. She got misty-eyed as she retold their announcement. If I see her again, here’s what I will say: “You’ll get through this. It won’t be painless.\nIt won’t be quick. But God will use this mess for good. Don’t be foolish or naïve. But don’t despair either. With God’s help, you will get through this.”\nWhere do I get the nerve to speak such a promise into tragedy? From Jesus. He said, “In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world” (John 16:33 NIV).\nWe will have trouble. No might or maybe about it. But we have every reason to be encouraged. Jesus has conquered the worst of this world. If we’re with him, that means we will conquer too. ',

Jesus tells us we will have trouble, but that doesn’t make it hurt less. Thankfully, he also offers himself. He is our hope and our healer. We can get through if we lean on him.'
