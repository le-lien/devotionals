Maybe you’ve slept in a bunk bed at camp or a hotel room on vacation. They have beds and tables. They may have food, and they may be warm, but they are not “your father’s house.”\nYour father’s house is where your father is. And your true home is where your heavenly Father is.\nYou may not always feel welcome here on earth. You may wonder if there is a place here for you. People can make you feel unwanted. Like a stranger in a house that’s not yours. You won’t always feel welcome here. ',

Ask your parents for a small pocket Bible of your own. Keep it in your purse or backpack. Whenever you’re feeling homesick, read a little bit about “home.”'
