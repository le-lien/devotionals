    "body": 'Once there was a man who dared God to speak: “Burn the bush like you did for Moses, God. And I will follow. Crumble the walls like you did for Joshua, God. And I will fight. Stop the storm like you did on the Sea of Galilee, God. And I will listen.”\nAnd so the man sat by a bush, near a wall, close to the sea, and waited for God to speak. God heard the man, so God answered. He sent fire—not for burning a bush, but a fiery passion for building a church. He tore down a wall—not of brick, but of sin. He stopped the storm—not on the sea, but in the soul.\nAnd God waited for the man to speak. And He waited … and waited.\nBut because the man was looking at bushes instead of hearts, bricks instead of people, seas instead of souls, he decided that God had done nothing.\nFinally the man looked to God and asked, “Have You lost Your power?” ',
