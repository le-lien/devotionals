The Lord of Hosts is in you and with you.\n\nOne time I was preaching in Doncaster, England, and a number of people were delivered. A man named Jack was greatly interested and moved by what he saw. He himself was suffering with a stiff knee. After he got home, he said to his wife, "I have taken in Wigglesworth‘s message, and now I am going to act on it and get deliverance. Wife, I want you to be the audience." He took hold of his knee and said, "Come out, you devil, in the name of Jesus." Then he said, "It is all right, wife." He took the yards and yards of flannel off and found he was all right without the bandage.\n\nThe next night he went to the little Primitive Methodist church where he worshipped. There were a lot of young people there who were in bad situations, and Jack had a tremendous ministry delivering his friends through the name of Jesus. He had been given to see that a great many ills to which flesh is heir are nothing else but the operation of the Enemy; but his faith had risen also, and he saw that in the name of Jesus there was a power that was more than a match for the Enemy.\n\nLater, in a meeting in Gottenberg, Sweden, a man fell full length in the doorway. The evil spirit threw him down, manifesting itself and disturbing the whole meeting. I laid hold of this man and cried out to the evil spirit within him, "Come out, you devil! In the name of Jesus, we cast you out as an evil spirit." I lifted him up and said, "Stand on your feet and walk in the name of Jesus." I don‘t know whether anybody in the meeting understood me except the interpreter, but the devils knew what I said. I spoke in English, but these demons in Sweden cleared out.',
