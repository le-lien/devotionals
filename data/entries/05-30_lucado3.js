If your family doesn’t appreciate you, take heart; neither did Jesus’. Christ himself said, “A prophet is honored everywhere except in his hometown and with his own people and in his own home” (Mark 6:4 NCV).\nThere was a time when Jesus’ brothers and sisters were seen with him in public. Not because they were proud of him but because they were ashamed of him. “His family … went to get him because they thought he was out of his mind” (Mark 3:21 NCV). Jesus’ siblings thought their brother was a lunatic. They were embarrassed!\nMaybe you know the feeling? Maybe your family is more drama than delight, more crazy than kind? I can’t say that your family will ever understand or bless you, but I know God will. Let God give you what your family doesn’t. If your earthly family doesn’t support you, then let your heavenly one take its place.\nONE MORE THOUGHT\nWe can’t choose our families. If your father is a jerk, you can be the world’s best child and he still won’t tell you so. It’s an unfair game with unfair rules. ',
