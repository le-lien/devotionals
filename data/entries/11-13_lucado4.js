The one thing he wants more than anything is the one thing he can’t seem to find—water. So when he does finally find that pool of water, he just can’t help but shout out his thankfulness.\nWorship is the thank-you that just can’t be quiet.\nSometimes people try to make a science out of worship, with rules for our songs and for our prayers. But worship isn’t supposed to be about rules\n—it’s supposed to be so much more.\nWorship is the heart’s thank-you … offered by the one who is saved to the Savior, by the one who is healed to the Healer, and by the one who is delivered to the Deliverer.
