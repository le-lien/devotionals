    "body": 'The book of Matthew was first written in Greek. The Greek word for\n“felt sorry” is splanchnizomai. Since you probably haven’t studied splanchnizomai  in school, this word won’t mean much to you. But what it means is “in the gut.”\nSo when Matthew wrote that Jesus felt sorry for the people, he didn’t mean that Jesus just felt a little sad for them. No, it is far more powerful.\nMatthew was saying that Jesus felt their hurt like a punch in the gut: He felt the limp of the crippled.\nHe felt the hurt of the sick.\nHe felt the loneliness of the leper.\nHe felt the shame of the sinful.
