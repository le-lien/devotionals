    "body": 'Does discouragement preach to you a false gospel that causes you to forget that your future has already been written into the pages of God’s book?\nIt is discouraging to face:\nyour struggle with sin;\nthe disloyalty of a friend;\nthe rebellion of your children;\nthe souring of your marriage;\nthe division of your church;\nthe temptations that seem to be all around you;\nthe injustice that lives in this fallen world;\nthe pain and worry of physical sickness;\nthe loss of your job;\nthe hardship of old age; or\nthe death of your dreams.\nYes, it’s hard to face all of these things. It’s easy to lose your way. It’s tempting to wonder what God is doing, if he cares, and if he hears your prayers.\nIt’s hard to hold on to his promises. It’s hard to stay committed to good spiritual habits. It’s hard not to give in to discouragement and give way to the desire to quit.\nBut in the face of discouragement, there is one thing that you need to remember. It is captured in just a few powerful words from Psalm 139: “Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there were none of them” (v. 16).\nIt is vital to remember, when trouble comes your way and discouragement begins to grip your heart, that every single day of your life was written into God’s book before you lived the very first of them. None of those days and none of the things that you have faced or will face in those days are a surprise to your Lord. He carefully authored the content of every one of those days with his own hand. He controlled every twist and turn of the plot that is your story. He\nintroduced all the characters and determined all of the locations. Nothing will happen to you that he has not written into his book. And he has already determined how your story will end.\nYou see, what discourages you doesn’t surprise him because he authored it all with a glorious combination of wisdom and grace. Nothing is out of his control. Your Savior is sovereign. He knows what is best and will do what is best. This is where rest and courage are to be found when discouragement shakes the resolve of your heart.',
