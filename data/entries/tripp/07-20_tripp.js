    "body": 'Grace doesn’t help you just to do different things but to become a totally different person by changing you at the level of your heart.\nI want to refer you right now to one of the Bible’s best-known prayers of confession. The problem is that it’s so familiar to most of us that we’ve quit giving it the examination that it requires in order for us to receive from it the rescue that it offers. The confession is David’s in Psalm 51:1–12: Have mercy on me, O God,\naccording to your steadfast love; according to your abundant mercy blot out my transgressions.\nWash me thoroughly from my iniquity,\nand cleanse me from my sin!\nFor I know my transgressions,\nand my sin is ever before me.\nAgainst you, you only, have I sinned\nand done what is evil in your sight, so that you may be justified in your words and blameless in your judgment.\nBehold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.\nBehold, you delight in truth in the inward being, and you teach me wisdom in the secret heart.\nPurge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.\nLet me hear joy and gladness;\nlet the bones that you have broken rejoice.\nHide your face from my sins,\nand blot out all my iniquities.\nCreate in me a clean heart, O God,\nand renew a right spirit within me.\nCast me not away from your presence,\nand take not your Holy Spirit from me.\nRestore to me the joy of your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit.\nLook carefully at the words of David’s prayer. This is not only a prayer of confession—it is also a cry for change. He admits that his problem is not environmental, but natal; he came into the world with it. He confesses that his problem is not external, but internal; it’s a problem of the “inward being.” So he cries out for what every sinner needs: a new heart. It is something only God can create. It is the epicenter of his work of grace. He wants more than reformed\nbehavior; he sent his Son to die for you so that you would have a new heart, one that is constantly being renewed. If your heart is your problem, then the grace of heart change is your only hope.',
