    "body": 'If you hook the hope of your heart to the people around you, you will always be disappointed. No one is able to be your personal messiah.\nYou should be thankful for the people whom God places in your life. You should love them dearly. You should treat them with honor and respect. You should do all you can to maintain the unity and peace of your relationships with them. You should be willing to give to and serve them. You should be open to them as they speak into your life. You should recognize that you were designed to live in loving community with others like them. But you cannot look to them to provide for you what only God can provide.\nThere are many, many Christian relationships that are hurtful, painful, and marked by conflict and disappointment because the people in those relationships are placing a burden on those relationships that no human relationship can bear.\nNo person can be the source of your identity.\nNo one can be the basis of your happiness.\nNo individual can give you a reason to get up in the morning and continue.\nNo loved one can be the carrier of your hope.\nNo one is able to change you from the inside out.\nNo human being can alter your past.\nNo person is able to atone for your wrongs.\nNo one can give your heart peace and rest.\nAsking another human being to do those things is like requiring him to be the fourth member of the Trinity and then judging him when he falls short. It simply cannot and will not work. You see, it is vital to remember that human love is a wonderful thing, but you will only ever find life—real, heart-changing, soul-satisfying life—in a vertical relationship. You should enjoy human love, but you should look to God for your spiritual vitality and strength. You should commit to long-term, loving, mutually serving relationships, but you must remember that only God can save you, change you, and deliver you from you. You should be willing to make sacrifices of love for others, but you should place your hope\nonly in the once-for-all sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ.\nCould it be that the disappointment you experience in your relationships is the product of unrealistic and unattainable expectations? Could it be that you have unwittingly put people in God’s place? Could it be that you ask the person next to you to do for you what only God can do? There is but one Savior, and he is yours forever. You don’t need to put that burden on the person next to you.',
