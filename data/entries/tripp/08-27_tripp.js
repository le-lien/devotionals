    "body": 'God calls you to live a wise and righteous life, then he connects you to the One who is wisdom and righteousness, the Lord Jesus Christ.\nWho do you think you are? I’m serious. What is the identity (or identities) that you assign to yourself that defines who you are and what you’re supposed to be doing? Even more important, who do you tell yourself that God is, and how does that shape the way you think about and respond to the opportunities, responsibilities, and temptations of everyday life? There’s a real way in which the gospel of Jesus Christ is one big massive identity story.\nThe Bible was written to pull back the curtains and reveal to us the One who sits at the center of all things. The Bible doesn’t just reveal his position, his power, and his plan. The Bible reveals to us his character as well. The Bible tells us that God is the Creator, Controller, and King over all things. It tells us that God is boundless in authority, wisdom, and power. However, the Bible also tells us that this high and mighty One is slow to anger and plenteous in love; that he is merciful, tender, kind, and forgiving. It tells us that he is the longsuffering Giver of amazing grace.\nBut the Bible also reveals your identity. It tells you that not only are you the creation of this awesome God, but that because of sin you are a fallen creation.\nYou were created by God to be dependent on him, but sin makes you rebellious.\nSin makes you quest for independence and self-sufficiency. Sin makes you love what is foolish while thinking that you’re wise. Sin makes you think you’re capable of what you cannot do. Sin makes you think you’re righteous when really your heart is corrupt. Sin convinces you that you are okay when actually you’re heading for disaster. The Bible lovingly confronts you with everything you are not. It does so in order that you would run after everything you could be.\nThe Bible forces you to face your foolishness and failure so you would run to One who is wisdom and righteousness, and find your hope in him.\nYes, the Bible does call you to do what you cannot do, but it doesn’t leave you there. It introduces you to the One who gives you absolutely everything that you need. This is what the gospel is about. The cross makes a way for the One who is everything that you’re not to become for you and in you everything that\nyou need. “You are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption” (1 Cor. 1:30).',
