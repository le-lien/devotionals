    "body": 'God’s grace is active, rescuing, transformative grace. You celebrate this by being as serious about your need as the God of this grace is.\nIt is a good question to ask yourself, one that is worth not answering quickly.\nHow serious are you about the sin that was the reason for the most costly sacrifice ever made? Consider God’s seriousness, as pictured for us in the drama in the garden of Eden. Study the following words carefully: The LORD God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and above all beasts of the field; on your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat\nall the days of your life.\nI will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head,\nand you shall bruise his heel.”\nTo the woman he said,\n“I will surely multiply your pain in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children.\nYour desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.”\nAnd to Adam he said,\n“Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you,\n‘You shall not eat of it,’\ncursed is the ground because of you; in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life; thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; and you shall eat the plants of the field.\nBy the sweat of your face\nyou shall eat bread,\ntill you return to the ground,\nfor out of it you were taken; for you are dust,\nand to dust you shall return.” (Gen. 3:14–19)\nGod took sin so seriously that he did two things when the first transgression occurred—he immediately meted out punishment and he immediately set in motion his plan of rescue and redemption. Both demonstrate God’s seriousness about what we all too easily deny or minimize.',
