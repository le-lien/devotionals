Grace makes that relationship possible.\nIt is one of the often understated, definitively dark, and dangerous results of sin.\nWhat is it? Sin reduces all of us to fools. Sadly, we demonstrate that foolishness every day. We think we can spend what we want to satisfy our seemingly endless desires without getting into hopeless debt. We think that sex, food, and fun will satisfy the hunger of our hearts for contentment and life. We think we can rebel against authority, and it will be all right in the end. We think we can be selfish and demanding in our relationships, and our loved ones will still want to be near us. We think we can pursue the pleasures of creation at any time and in any way we want, and not get fat, addicted, and in debt. We think that we can step over God’s boundaries without consequences. We think we deserve what we do not deserve and are able to do what we cannot do. Shockingly, there are more times than most of us recognize or would be willing to admit when we think we’re smarter than God.\nTo sinners (and that includes us all), wisdom is not natural. It is one of humanity’s most profoundly important quests. Perhaps there are few more significant questions than this: “Where is wisdom to be found?” It is hard for us to gain wisdom by research or experience because they are filtered and interpreted by our own foolish hearts! It is here where the Bible greets us with a radical, counterintuitive message. You can’t buy wisdom. You can’t get it by hard work or lots of experience. No, wisdom is the result of rescue and relationship. To be wise, you first need to be rescued from you. You need to be given a new heart, one that is needy, humble, seeking, and ready to get from above what you can’t find on this earth. And then you need to be brought into a relationship with the One who is wisdom. Colossians 2:3 says of Jesus, “in [him]\nare hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.” Think of this: grace has connected you to the One who is wisdom. Grace has caused wisdom to live inside you. This means that wisdom is always with you and is always available to you.\nThe One who is wisdom now guides you. Wisdom protects you. Wisdom\nconvicts you. Wisdom teaches and matures you. Wisdom encourages and comforts you. Wisdom works to change your thoughts and redirect your desires.\nWisdom forgives your past and holds your future in his hands. And wisdom will welcome you into an eternity where foolishness will be no more. Today you will once again demonstrate your need for wisdom’s work. Don’t resist. Reach out for help with a thankful heart; wisdom has come to be with you forever.',
