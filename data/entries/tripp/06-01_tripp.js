    "body": 'God’s care comes in many forms. He cares enough to break your bones in order to capture your heart.\nI wish your care was always easy, predictable, safe— a cool drink a soft pillow— but you are too wise, too loving,\ntoo committed to your work of transforming grace.\nSo your gracious care comes to me in uncomfortable forms: the redeeming care of disappointment, the unexpected trial,\nsuffering, loss.\nThese things don’t tell me you’re cold-hearted, absent, uninvolved.\nNo, each is a sign of zealous grace, redeeming love.\nI struggle to grasp how much you care,\nso I struggle to rest in that care.\nYou care enough to give me what I need,\nnot what I want.\nYou care enough to break my bones in order\nto recapture my heart.',
