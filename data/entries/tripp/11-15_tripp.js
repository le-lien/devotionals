    "body": 'Today you have hope, not because people like you or because situations are easy, but because God has placed his unshakable love on you.\nLooking to the fallen world to give you hope to continue just doesn’t work very well. Think about the address where you live:\nYou live with fallen people who inevitably disappoint you in some way.\nYou live in a broken world where corruption and injustice are commonplace.\nYou face temptation somehow, some way every day.\nYour physical body is growing older and can be infected with disease.\nStorms and pollution complicate your life.\nSatan prowls, doing his evil work.\nThe physical creation groans, waiting for redemption.\nWar and strife pit nation against nation.\nPartiality and prejudice divide us.\nSin creates constant instability and unpredictability around us because the world that we live in simply does not function the way the One who created it intended. There are times when life works well and seems easy, but there are many other times when sickness, a betrayal, an injustice, a financial loss, the corruption of an official, a crime against you, or the death of a loved one makes life very hard.\nIt is so good to know that you don’t have to frantically look for sturdy hope horizontally, where it just can’t be found. No, you are freed from this search because powerful grace has connected you to hope. You see, hope is not a situation, a location, a feeling, or a relationship. Hope is a person, and his name is Jesus. He died so that you can know life, real life. He is present with you so that you are guaranteed to have everything you need. He forgives you of all your sins and empowers you to do much better. He never leaves you or turns his back on you. He always responds to you in tender compassion and righteous justice.\nHe never mocks your weaknesses or throws your sin in your face. He never gets\ntired of you or gives up on his relationship with you. He doesn’t ask you to earn what you can never deserve, and he never makes you feel guilty for needing his good gifts. His love isn’t conditional and his grace is never temporary. Jesus is your hope as you live in a world where hope is a precious and rare commodity.\nAnd remember, you are connected to him forever. This means there will be a day when you won’t have to hope anymore, because the paradise you have hoped for will be the eternal reality in which you live.',
