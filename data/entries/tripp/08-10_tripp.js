    "body": 'God knows everything from beyond origin to beyond destiny.\nYou have ___ years of sin-tainted human experience. Why debate him?\nGod’s smarter!\nIt’s really amazing how much I don’t know:\nI don’t know how children from the very same gene pool can be so different.\nI don’t know how bees could ever fly.\nI don’t know why I do all the things I do.\nI don’t know what tomorrow will bring.\nI don’t know how long my life will be.\nI don’t know the motivations of my heart, let alone the hearts of others.\nI don’t know so many things about art, science, and politics.\nI don’t know why I wake up happy on some days and morose on others.\nI don’t know many things about origins and many things about destiny.\nI don’t know many things about the operation of my own body.\nI don’t know many things about the function of my own brain.\nI don’t know why weeds overtake flowers.\nI don’t really understand what makes rain.\nI often don’t understand the plan and purpose of God.\nI don’t know why God brings certain things into my life.\nThis is just a brief, spontaneous list of some of the things I don’t know. If I were to take the time, I could fill hundreds of pages with lists of things I don’t know, and there would still be myriad things not on the pages simply because I don’t know that I don’t know them. In light of this, it is stunning to know that God knows absolutely everything. Yes, you read it right— everything. His knowledge is unsearchable. His grasp on what is has no beginning and no end.\nHe is never confused. He never has to live with misunderstanding. There is nothing that ever surprises him or leaves him perplexed. He never has trouble reconciling one truth with another. He never has to deal with gaps in his\nknowledge. He is never in the position of wishing he could have the wisdom of another. He never has to relearn something. He never has to admit that what he thought was wrong. No one ever showed him the path of understanding or taught him knowledge (Isa. 40:14). So run from any thought that you are smarter.\nConsume his wisdom and be thankful for the grace that rescues you from your own foolishness and connects you to One who defines what is wise.',
