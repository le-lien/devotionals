    "body": 'No matter how people treat you today, if you’re God’s child, you’re being loved right now by an ever-present, ever-loving Redeemer.\nWho has believed what he has heard from us?\nAnd to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?\nFor he grew up before him like a young plant, and like a root out of dry ground; he had no form or majesty that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him.\nHe was despised and rejected by men;\na man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not.\nSurely he has borne our griefs\nand carried our sorrows;\nyet we esteemed him stricken,\nsmitten by God, and afflicted… .\nHe was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth.\nBy oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as for his generation, who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living, stricken for the transgression of my people?\nAnd they made his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death, although he had done no violence,\nand there was no deceit in his mouth.\n(Isa. 53:1–4, 7–9)\nIt is incredibly encouraging to think about as you and I make our way through a world that is marked by hatred, violence, injustice, racism, betrayal, disloyalty, selfishness, abuse, and many other forms of relational sin and brokenness. It is something that needs to be remembered in those moments when you have been sinned against in some way. Read carefully what I am going to write next: Jesus was willing to be despised. He was willing to face rejection. He was willing to subject himself to hatred and violence. He was even willing to have the Father turn his back on him. Why was he willing to do all this? He did it willingly so that, as his children, you and I would be able to live in the hope and peace of knowing that no matter what we face in the human community, we are perfectly and eternally loved by him. He endured rejection so that we would know God’s accepting love forever and ever and ever. How amazing is this grace!',
