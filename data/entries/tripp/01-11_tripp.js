    "body": 'If you have been freed from needing success and acclaim to feel good about yourself, you know grace has visited you.\nIt is an intensely human endeavor. It is the quest we all pursue. We all want to feel good about ourselves. We all want to think that we are okay. It is a fearful and anxious quest from which only grace can free you.\nHere’s what happens to us all—we seek horizontally for the personal rest that we are to find vertically, and it never works. Looking to others for your inner sense of well-being is pointless. First, you will never be good enough, consistently enough, to get the regular praise of others that you are seeking.\nYou’re going to mess up. You’re bound to disappoint. You will have a bad day.\nYou’ll lose your way. At some point, you’ll say or do things that you shouldn’t.\nAdd to this the fact that the people around you aren’t typically interested in taking on the burden of being your personal messiah. They don’t want to live with the responsibility of having your identity in their hands. Looking to people for your inner self-worth never works.\nThe peace that success gives is unreliable as well. Since you are less than perfect, whatever success you are able to achieve will soon be followed by failure of some kind. Then there is the fact that the buzz of success is short-lived.\nIt isn’t long before you’re searching for the next success to keep you going.\nThat’s why the reality that Jesus has become your righteousness is so precious.\nHis grace has forever freed us from needing to prove our righteousness and our worth. So we remind ourselves every day not to search horizontally for what we’ve already been given vertically. “And the effect of righteousness will be peace, and the result of righteousness, quietness and trust forever” (Isa. 32:17).\nThat righteousness is found in Christ alone.',
