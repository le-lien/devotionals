    "body": 'Prayer is abandoning all other objects of worship and giving myself to the daily worship of God alone.\nI shouldn’t have to say this, but I think it is necessary—prayer is an act of worship. It is profoundly more than bringing to God our grocery lists of self-defined wants and needs. Here are seven ways in which prayer is rooted in worship:\n1. Prayer acknowledges God’s existence.  This is the bottom line of all true prayer. It begins and ends with the recognition that there is something more ultimate in the universe than you. Prayer places emphasis firmly on the first four words of the Bible: “In the beginning, God . . .” So prayer is an acknowledgment of God as Creator and Sovereign. It is rooted in assent to his power, wisdom, and rule. It would make no sense to pray if you thought that God was your equal.\n2. Prayer bows to God’s glory.  This is the constant requirement of prayer.\nYou cannot pray properly without recognizing that there is a greater glory in this universe than your own glory or the variegated glories of the physical created world. Prayer is recognition that no created glory can or will ever satisfy the heart of the one who prays. It flows from the understanding that it is only when you live for the glory of God that your heart can rest content.\n3. Prayer submits to God’s plan.  Prayer is not asking God to endorse and resource your plan for your life. Prayer is recognition that the One who made the world, including you, knows what is best for you. As the psalmist says, “the rules of the LORD are true, and righteous altogether” (Ps. 19:9).\nPrayer is not bringing your list and asking God to sign on the bottom.\nPrayer is handing God a blank sheet that you have already signed and trusting him to fill it out as he sees fit.\n4. Prayer confesses allegiance to God’s kingdom.  Prayer is recognition that on this side of eternity there is a war between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of self. In prayer, you don’t ask God to endorse the self-focused\nlittle dreams of your claustrophobic kingdom of one; rather, you commit your heart to the plans and purposes of God’s kingdom and seek the grace to be part of what God is doing and not in the way of it.\n5. Prayer rests in God’s provision.  True prayer isn’t spoken in a panic, but in a spirit of trust and rest. You know that the One to whom you pray is near, faithful, and willing to meet your every need.\n6. Prayer celebrates God’s grace.  True prayer arises when you are blown away by grace, for it is grace that gives you the desire to pray, the welcome of God to pray, and the promise that he will answer.\n7. Prayer commits to God’s work.  Finally, prayer is an acknowledgment that between the “already” and the “not yet,” there is work of God to be done, and you need wisdom and strength for that work.\nPrayer is laying down your idols and kneeling before God in humble and joyful worship.',
