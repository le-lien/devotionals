    "body": 'Real faith never calls you to swindle yourself into thinking that things are better than they are. Biblical faith is shockingly honest and hopeful.\nBiblical faith is not about wearing a saccharine smile while living in a constant state of religious denial. It’s not about covering the stark and dark realities of a fallen world with overused pseudobiblical clichés. It’s not about praying in King James English because somehow that makes you feel more spiritual. It’s not about priding yourself on your ability to keep God’s rules or thinking you’re more sanctified because you’re on pace to read through the whole Bible again this year. It’s not about cleaning yourself up on Sunday so your public persona hides the real details of your private spiritual life. It’s not about keeping score of how many years you’ve gone through without missing a worship service. It’s not about polishing your righteousness so you look better to you and to others. It’s not about saying you’re okay when you give daily empirical evidence that you are anything but okay. If you are doing, saying, or thinking religious things that are meant to protect you from reality, you are not living biblical Christianity.\nYou may feel better, but your heart has not been quieted by biblical faith. The faith of the Bible will never call you to deny reality in any way. The faith of the Bible is so in awe of the grandeur and glory of God that it is able to look at the darkest of realities in life and not be afraid.\nAbraham did not need to deny reality in order to leave his home without knowing for sure where God was taking him. Noah did not need to deny reality in order to spend 120 years building that ark. The children of Israel did not need to deny reality in order to walk around Jericho for seven days. David did not need to deny reality in order to face Goliath in battle. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego did not need to deny reality in order to step into that white-hot furnace. Peter didn’t need to deny reality in order to stand before the Sanhedrin and refuse to quit preaching the gospel. You see, it wasn’t the naïveté of faith that propelled these people. No, it was the clarity of faith that caused them to do what they did.\nIt is only when you look at this dark world through the lens of the existence, power, authority, wisdom, faithfulness, love, and grace of the King of kings and\nLord of lords that you see reality with clarity. You cannot ever assess and understand what you are facing if you omit the fact of facts—the existence of God. In fact, that’s how the writer of Hebrews defines faith: “And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him” (11:6).\nAre you lacking faith? Run to the One who freely gives it as his gift of grace to you.',
