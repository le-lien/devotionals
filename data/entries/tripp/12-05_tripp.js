    "body": 'You can’t live to meet all your needs and live to serve Christ at the same time. Live as his disciple; he’s got your true needs covered.\nWe place many things in our “I just can’t live without” category, but the reality is that many of them are not things we actually require for life. These things may be wonderful to enjoy and sweet blessings from a tender and loving Father, but they are not needs and must not be named as such. When we call them needs, we tell ourselves that we have to have them, that we cannot live without them, and that we have a right to demand them. So we end up evaluating the love of God on the basis of how many of the things that we have christened as needs he has delivered to us. As we do this, our lives get shaped by a needs focus, and we spend so much time thinking about and working toward acquiring our needs that we have little personal time left for the larger pursuits of the kingdom of God.\nBecause of this, Philippians 4:10–20 is very instructive for us: I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length you have revived your concern for me. You were indeed concerned for me, but you had no opportunity. Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content. I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need. I can do all things through him who strengthens me.\nYet it was kind of you to share my trouble. And you Philippians yourselves know that in the beginning of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church entered into partnership with me in giving and receiving, except you only. Even in Thessalonica you sent me help for my needs once and again.\nNot that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that increases to your credit. I have received full payment, and more. I am well supplied, having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God. And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus. To our God and Father be glory forever and ever.\nAmen.\nYou quit worrying about your catalog of “I must haves” and therefore are freed to give yourself to the work of God’s kingdom when: 1. you are convinced that God will give you the strength you need to face whatever he has ordained you to face (“I can do all things through him who strengthens me”) and\n2. you really do believe that God is actively committed to meeting every one\nof your true needs (“And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus”).\nWhen grace causes your heart to rest in these truths, you no longer live a need-obsessed life and are free to give yourself to the worship and service of God.',
