    "body": 'Jesus endured suffering in the here and now so that you and I could escape suffering for eternity.\nIt didn’t start with the cross; from the very first breath he took until he ascended, Jesus suffered:\nHe suffered an uncomfortable and unsanitary birth in a stable.\nHe suffered the terror of fleeing for his life as an infant.\nHe suffered the trials of growing and learning as a boy.\nHe suffered powerful temptation.\nHe suffered exposure to disease.\nHe suffered homelessness.\nHe suffered hunger.\nHe suffered sadness and grief.\nHe suffered disloyalty and betrayal.\nHe suffered physical pain.\nHe suffered disrespect and mockery.\nHe suffered misunderstanding and misrepresentation.\nHe suffered the emotional pain of the rejection of his Father.\nHe suffered punishment for the sins of others.\nHe suffered injustice.\nHe suffered violence.\nHe suffered death.\nHe suffered the full range of the hardships of life in this fallen world.\nHis calling, his mission, was to suffer, and suffer he did. His suffering was wide-ranging and constant. For the Messiah, suffering was an everyday thing, even a moment-by-moment thing. And every act of his suffering was substitutional. He suffered in our place. He suffered in every way we do so that he could be a Savior to us in our suffering and put an end to our suffering. He suffered every day so that there would be a time when all suffering would end and so that we could live with him in a world where suffering is no more.\nHe did not come to earth in regal splendor. He did not come to earth to live in a palace and be given homage as King. Although he was the King of kings, he came as a suffering servant who, in his suffering, would save us from ourselves and finally from our suffering. His suffering is our salvation. His suffering is our hope.',
