    "body": 'Discouragement focuses more on the broken glories of creation than on the restoring glories of God’s\ncharacter, presence, and promises.\nWhat captures your mind controls your thoughts and dominates the desires of your heart. Outside of intentional moments of public or private worship, what occupies your private meditation? That which dominates your meditation shapes the way you view yourself, life, and God, and your view of those things shapes the choices you make and the actions you take.\nIs your meditation kidnapped by:\nthe disloyalty of that good friend?\nthe sorry state of your finances?\ndisappointment with your church?\nthe dysfunction of your extended family?\nproblems in your marriage?\nthe daily struggles of parenting?\nyour frenetic and demanding schedule?\nphysical sickness?\nthe daily hardships of life in this fallen world?\nNow, you may be thinking: “Paul, what do I do with this stuff? How am I supposed to respond?” Well, one of the themes of this devotional is that biblical faith—that is, true faith in the existence, presence, promises, and provisions of God—never requires you to deny reality in any way. It is not biblical faith to try to convince yourself that things are better than they actually are. It is not biblical faith to work to make yourself feel good about what is not good. Biblical faith looks reality in the face and does not flinch.\nOn the other hand, there is a crucial difference between facing hard realities and allowing those realities to dominate the meditation of your heart (see God’s counsel to Joshua, Josh. 1:1–9). Here’s what biblical faith does: it examines reality, but it makes the Lord its meditation. It is only when you look at life\nthrough the window of the glory of the One who has been the source of your meditation that you see reality accurately. The more you meditate on your problems, the bigger and more insurmountable they seem to be. Meditating on God in the midst of your trouble reminds you once again that the God to whom grace has connected you is magnificent in his grandeur and glory. He is infinitely greater than any problem you could ever experience. Then your responses are shaped by his glory and not by the seeming size of your problems.',
