You’re the one God is looking for.\nGod is the waiting Father, the caring Shepherd in search of His lost lamb.\nHis legs are scratched, His feet are sore, and His eyes are burning. He climbs the cliffs and crosses the fields. He explores the caves. He cups His hand to His mouth and calls down into the canyon.\nAnd the name He calls is yours.\nGod doesn’t just sit up in heaven and hope that you’ll come looking for Him. He comes looking for you. There is nowhere you can go that He cannot find you. He wants to save you. He is calling out your name. Not just any name— your name. All you have to do is answer Him. ',
