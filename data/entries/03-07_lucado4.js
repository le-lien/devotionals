    "body": 'Look at Jonah in the belly of the fish. He’s floating around with tummy juices and sucked-in seaweed. He prays. Before he can say amen, the belly rumbles, the fish belches, and Jonah lands face-first on the beach.\nLook at Daniel in the lions’ den. Things aren’t looking good. Jonah was swallowed, and Daniel is about to be.\nOr look at Joseph in the pit, a dusty hole in a hot desert. His brothers have pulled the lid over the top and the wool over his eyes. Like Jonah and Daniel, Joseph is trapped. He is out of ideas. No exit. No hope. But even though Joseph’s road to the palace takes a turn through a pit and a prison, he ends up at the throne.\nThe stories of the Bible often go this way. One close call after another. ',
