    "body": '[Jesus] refused to be guided by anything other than his high call.\nHis heart was purposeful. Most lives aim at nothing in particular and achieve it. Jesus aimed at one goal—to save humanity from its sin. He could summarize his life with one sentence: “The Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost” (Luke 19:10 RSV). Jesus was so focused on his task that he knew when to say, “It is finished” (John 19:30). But he was not so focused on his goal that he was unpleasant.\nQuite the contrary. How pleasant were his thoughts! Children couldn’t resist Jesus. He could find beauty in lilies, joy in worship, and possibilities in problems. He would spend days with multitudes of sick people and still feel sorry for them. He spent over three decades wading through the muck and mire of our sin yet still saw enough beauty in us to die for our mistakes. ',
