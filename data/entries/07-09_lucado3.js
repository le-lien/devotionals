    "body": 'Remember the fear of Christ’s followers at his arrest? They ran. Scared as cats in a dog pound.\nBut fast-forward forty days. Bankrupt traitors have become a force of life-changing fury. Peter is preaching in the very precinct where Christ was arrested. Followers of Christ defy the enemies of Christ. Whip them and they’ll worship. Lock them up and they’ll launch a jailhouse ministry. As bold after the resurrection as they were cowardly before it.\nThere must be an explanation. Greed? They made no money. Power?\nThey gave all the credit to Christ. Popularity? Most were killed for their beliefs.\nOnly one explanation remains—a resurrected Christ and his Holy Spirit.\nThe courage of these men and women was forged in the fire of the empty tomb. You can call on this same courage. Whether you’re giving an oral report on Romania or telling the world about Christ, his strength is always with you. ',

      "text": 'Nobody makes a comeback like Christ. Old rock stars and ballplayers sometimes surprise us with a performance that seems beyond their years, but rising from the dead is reserved for Jesus only. The next time you need courage for a comeback, remember what Christ did. His power is in you.'
