Maybe you’ve slept in your share of hotels or motels. They have beds. They have tables. They may have food, and they may be warm, but they are a far cry from being “your father’s house.”\nWe don’t always feel welcome here on earth. We wonder if there is a place here for us. People insult and reject us. Tough times leave us feeling like strangers. We just don’t seem to fit in.\nWe shouldn’t. This isn’t our home. To feel unwelcome is no tragedy.\nIndeed it is healthy. We are not home here. This language we speak, it’s not ours. This body we wear, it isn’t us. And the world we live in, this isn’t home.\nWhere’s home? Heaven. It has rooms designed specifically for us. It’s filled with love. It’s the place we belong. It’s where our Father is. I can’t wait.\nIt’s home. ',

      "text": 'You really shouldn’t expect to feel too comfortable in this world. It’s filled with ideas and attitudes that make no sense—and they shouldn’t. A house, in fact a kingdom, is waiting for you. A place of purpose, yet peace. A place that’s inspiring and loving. A place you can finally call home.'
