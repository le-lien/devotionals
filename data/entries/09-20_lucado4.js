    "body": 'Some years ago a sociologist—a person who studies how people act—\nwent with a group of mountain climbers on an expedition. One of the things he noticed was the connection between clouds and contentment.\nWhere there were no clouds and the climbers could see the peak of the mountain, they were full of energy and eager to help one another. But when dark, gray clouds blocked their view of the mountaintop, the climbers became bad-tempered and selfish. ',

      "title": 'The same thing happens to us. As long as our eyes are on God’s majesty, there is a bounce in our step. We are happy with ourselves and happy to help others. But let our eyes focus on the dirt of this world, and we will grumble about every rock and mud puddle we have to step over. Because of this, Paul urged us to “think only about the things in heaven, not the things on earth” (Colossians 3:2).',
      "text": 'Growing in Grace Keep a weather journal for a week. Write down if the weather is warm or cold, sunny or cloudy. Also write down how you feel on those days. Does sunshine give you energy? Do clouds make you blue? If dark days drag you down, focus on the Son when there’s no sun in the sky.'
