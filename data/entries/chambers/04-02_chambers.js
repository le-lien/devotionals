  "body": 'When Paul received his sight, he received spiritually an insight into the Person of Jesus Christ, and the whole of his subsequent life and preaching was nothing but Jesus Christ - “I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.” No attraction was ever allowed to hold the mind and soul of Paul save the face of Jesus Christ.\nWe have to learn to maintain an unimpaired state of character up to the last notch revealed in the vision of Jesus Christ.\nThe abiding characteristic of a spiritual man is the interpretation of the Lord Jesus Christ to himself, and the interpretation to others of the purposes of God. The one concentrated passion of the life is Jesus Christ. Whenever you meet this note in a man, you feel he is a man after God’s own heart.\nNever allow anything to deflect you from insight into Jesus Christ. It is the test of whether you are spiritual or not. To be unspiritual means that other things have a growing fascination for you.\n“Since mine eyes have looked on Jesus,\nI’ve lost sight of all beside,\nSo enchained my spirit’s vision,\nGazing on the Crucified.”',
