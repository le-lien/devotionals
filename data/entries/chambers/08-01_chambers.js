  "body": 'If when God said “Go,” you stayed because you were so concerned\nabout your people at home, you robbed them of the teaching and preaching of Jesus Christ Himself. When you obeyed and left all consequences to God, the Lord went into your city to teach; as long as you would not obey, you were in the way. Watch where you begin to debate and to put what you call duty in competition with your Lord’s commands. “I know He told me to go, but then my duty was here;” that means you do not believe that Jesus means what He says.\nHe teaches where He instructs us not to.\n“Master, … let us make three tabernacles.”\nAre we playing the spiritual amateur providence in other lives? Are we so noisy in our instruction of others that God cannot get anywhere near them? We have to keep our mouths shut and our spirits alert. God wants to instruct us in regard to His Son, He wants to turn our times of prayer into mounts of transfiguration, and we will not let Him. When we are certain of the way God is going to work, He will never work in that way any more.\nHe works where He sends us to wait.\n“Tarry ye … until …”  Wait on God and He will work, but don’t wait in spiritual sulks because you cannot see an inch in front of you!\nAre we detached enough from our own spiritual hysterics to wait on God? To wait is not to sit with folded hands, but to learn to do what we are told.\nThese are phases of His ways we rarely recognize.',
