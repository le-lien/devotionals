It seems to me that the punishment for lying is still death. Not death of the body, maybe, but death of: a parent’s trust—Lies are like termites in the trunk of the family tree; a conscience—The real sadness of the second lie is that it’s always easier to tell than the first; a future—Just ask the student who was flunked for cheating if that lie was really worth it.

The problem with one lie is that it usually leads to another and another. Lies are kind of like onions—lots of layers and all of them stink!'
