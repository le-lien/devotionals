    "body": 'Exactly what is worship? I like King David’s definition. “Oh magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt His name together” (Ps. 34:3\nNASB). Worship is the act of magnifying God. Enlarging our vision of him.\nStepping into the cockpit to see where he sits and observe how he works. Of course, his size doesn’t change, but our perception of him does. As we draw nearer, he seems larger. Isn’t that what we need? A big  view of God? Don’t we have big  problems, big  worries, big  questions? Of course we do. Hence we need a big view of God.\nWorship offers that. How can we sing, “Holy, Holy, Holy” and not have our vision expanded? ',
