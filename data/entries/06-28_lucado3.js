    "body": 'Joseph was twenty-seven years old when he crashed into a sandbar of sexual temptation. When his brothers sold him into slavery, they probably thought they’d doomed him to hard labor and an early death. Instead, an Egyptian named Potiphar put Joseph in charge of his household. People noticed him, including Mrs. Potiphar. Before long, she made her play: “Come to bed with me!” (Genesis 39:7 NIV).\nFar from home, rejected by his family, stressed from work, Joseph could have justified it. So can you. You’ve been dumped, bruised, and burned. Few friends and fewer solutions. A guy or gal sends you a text: “Meet me tonight.”\nOr a friend slides you a beer. A classmate offers some drugs. Excuses pop up like weeds after a summer rain. No one would know. I won’t get caught. It won’t hurt anyone. Except that isn’t true. You’d be hurting the people who care about you. Not to mention God. Not to mention yourself.\nJoseph turned Mrs. Potiphar down. He wanted no part of her poison. Put yourself in Joseph’s shoes and do the same.\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
