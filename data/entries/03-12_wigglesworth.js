    "body": 'It is a necessity for every one of us to be filled with God. It is not sufficient to have just a touch or to be filled with just a I desire. Only one thing will meet the needs of the people, and that is for you to be immersed in the life of God. This means that God takes you and fills you with His Spirit until you live right in God. He does this so that “whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do,  [it may be] all to the glory of God”  (1 Cor. 10:31). In that place you will find that all your strength and all your mind and all your soul are filled with a zeal, not only for worship, but also for proclamation. This proclamation is accompanied by all the power of God, which must move satanic power and disturb the world.\n\nThe reason the world is not seeing Jesus is that Christian people are not filled with Jesus. They are satisfied with attending meetings weekly, reading the Bible occasionally, and praying sometimes. Beloved, if God lays hold of you by the Spirit, you will find that there is an end of everything and a beginning in God. Your whole body will become seasoned with a divine likeness of God. He will not only begin to use you, but also take you in hand, so that you might be “a vessel for honor”  (2 Tim. 2:21). Our lives are not to be lived for ourselves, for if we live for ourselves we will die (Rom. 8:13); but if “by the Spirit [we] put to death the deeds of the body, [we] will live”  (v. 13). He who lives in the Spirit is subject to the powers of God, but he who lives for himself will die. The man who lives in the Spirit lives a life of freedom, joy, blessing, and service— a life that brings blessing to others. God wants us see that we must live in the Spirit.',
