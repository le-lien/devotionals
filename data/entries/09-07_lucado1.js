    "body": 'Our Master has a strict honor code. From Genesis to Revelation, the theme is the same: God loves the truth and hates deceit. In 1 Corinthians 6:9–10 Paul lists the type of people who will not inherit the kingdom of God. The covey he portrays is a ragged assortment of those who sin sexually, worship idols, take part in adultery, sell their bodies, get drunk, rob people, and—there it is— lie about others.\nSuch rigor may surprise you. You mean my fibbing and flattering stir the same heavenly anger as adultery and aggravated assault?  Apparently so…\n.\nWhy the hard line? Why the tough stance?\nFor one reason: dishonesty is absolutely contrary to the character of God. ',
