It means you choose to:\nObey your parents.\nBe the one at school who refuses to cheat.\nBe the neighbor who is helpful and kind.\nBe the one who does the chores but never complains.\nBe careful with your money and always give some to God.\nEnjoy life and keep a smile on your face.\nLive like Jesus, not just talk about Him.\nPeople are watching the way you act more than they are listening to what you say. So although it’s important to talk about Jesus and to share His Word, it’s even more important to live like Jesus. ',
