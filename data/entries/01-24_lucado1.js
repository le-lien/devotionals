He needs to grieve. He longs to relax with his followers. He needs anything but another crowd of thousands to teach and heal.\nBut his love for people overcomes his need for rest… .\nMany of those he healed would never say “thank you,” but he healed them anyway. Most would be more concerned with being healthy than being holy, but he healed them anyway. Some of those who asked for bread today would cry for his blood a few months later, but he healed them anyway… . He had compassion on them. ',
