    "body": 'God called David “a man after my own heart.” One might read David’s story and wonder what God saw in him. The fellow fell as often as he stood, stumbled as often as he conquered. He stared down Goliath yet ogled Bathsheba, defied God-mockers in the valley yet joined them in the wilderness. He could lead armies but couldn’t manage a family. Raging David. Weeping David. Bloodthirsty. God-hungry.\nA man after God’s own heart? That God saw him that way gives hope to us all. Straight-A souls find David’s story disappointing. The rest of us find it reassuring. We ride the same roller coaster. We alternate between swan dives and belly flops, savory steaks and burnt toast.\nWe need David’s story. Some note the absence of miracles in his story.\nNo Red Sea openings, chariots flaming, or dead Lazaruses walking. No miracles. But there is one. David is one. The God who made a miracle out of David stands ready to make one out of you. ',

His actions didn’t always merit applause, but his heart was usually in the right place. That’s a good starting point for all of us. Set your heart on God and you’re going to be just fine.'
