    "body": 'A nger. It’s easy to define: the noise of the soul. Anger. The unseen irritant of the heart. Anger. The relentless invader of silence. The louder it gets, the more desperate we become.\nYou may be thinking, You don’t have any idea how hard my life has been.\nAnd you’re right, I don’t. Abused? Betrayed? Rejected? Ignored? I don’t know your story. But I have a very clear idea how miserable your future will be unless you deal with your anger.\nX-ray the world of the enraged, and you’ll find a tumor of bitterness: black, menacing, malignant. Cancer of the spirit. Its fatal fibers creep around the edge of the heart and ravage it. Yesterday you can’t alter, but your reaction to yesterday you can. The past you cannot change, but your response to your past you can. The Bible has the answer: “Stop being bitter and angry and mad at others. . . . Instead, be kind and merciful, and forgive others, just as God forgave you because of Christ” (Ephesians 4:31–32 CEV). ',
