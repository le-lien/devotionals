    "body": 'In the Day of Pentecost,  “they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit O gave them utterance” (Acts 2:4).   What a lovely thought that the Holy Spirit had such sway that the words were all His! Jesus stands forth in the midst with such divine glory, and men are im-pelled, filled, and led so perfectly. Only He will meet the needs of the world.\n\nWe see that there was something beautiful about Peter and John when we read that people “realized that they had been with Jesus.”  There was something so real, so after the order of the Master, about them.\n\nThe one thing that was more marked than anything else in the life of Jesus was the fact that the people glorified God in Him. And when God is glorified and gets the right-of-way and the wholehearted attention of His people, everyone is as He is, filled with God. Whatever it costs, it must be. Let it be so. Filled with God! The only thing that will help people is to speak the latest thing God has given us from the glory.\n\nThere is nothing outside salvation. We are filled, immersed, clothed upon with the Spirit. There must be nothing felt, seen, or spoken about except the mighty power of the Holy Spirit. We are new creatures in Christ Jesus (2 Cor. 5:17), baptized into a new nature. “He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water” (John 7:38).   We are in the world to meet the need, but we are not of the world or of its spirit. (See John 17:15–16.) We are “partakers of the divine nature”  (2 Pet. 1:4) to manifest the life of Jesus to the world. This is God in-carnate in humanity.',
