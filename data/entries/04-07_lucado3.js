    "body": 'Paul was in prison in Rome and knew his execution was near. In a letter written within earshot of the sharpening of the blade that would sever his head, Paul urged Timothy to remember. You can almost picture the old warrior smiling as he wrote the words. “Remember Jesus Christ, who was raised from the dead. . . . This is the Good News I preach” (2 Timothy 2:8\nNCV).\nWhen times get hard, remember Jesus. When people don’t listen, remember Jesus. When tears come, remember Jesus. When disappointment is your partner, remember Jesus.\nRemember the sick who were healed with his callused hands. Remember the dead called from the grave with a Galilean accent. Remember the eyes of God that wept human tears. Remember Jesus, the reason a prisoner could talk about Good News just before his execution—and the reason we can talk about Good News no matter what crisis we face. ',
