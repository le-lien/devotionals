    "body": 'If it is only a finger or a tooth that aches, if it is only a corn on your foot that pinches you or anything in the body that I detracts from the highest spiritual attainment, the kingdom of heaven is dethroned to a degree; “the kingdom of heaven suffers violence”  (Matt. 11:12).\n\nBy the Word of God, I am proving to you that the kingdom of heaven is within you. “Greater is he that is in you”  (1 John 4:4 KJV)—the Son of God, the kingdom of heaven within you— “than he that is in the world”  (v. 4 KJV)—the power of Satan outside you.\n\nDisease or weakness, or any distraction in you, is a power of violence that can take the kingdom of heaven in you by force. The same spiritual power that will reveal this to you, will relieve you.\n\nOn the authority of the Word of God, I maintain that “greater is he that is in you”  (1 John 4:4 KJV) than any power of Satan that is around you (v. 4). How much more would be done if you would inwardly claim your rights and deliver yourselves!\n\nI believe the Bible from front to back. If, by the power of God, I put in you an audacity, a determination, so that you won‘t let Satan rest, you will be victorious. Praise the Lord!\n\nWhy do I take this attitude? Because for every step of my life since my baptism, I have had to pay the price of everything for others. God has to take me through to the place so that I may be able to show the people how to do it. Some people come up to me and say, "I have been waiting for the baptism, and I am having such a struggle. I am having to fight for every inch of it. Isn‘t it strange?" No. A thousand to one, God is preparing you to help somebody else who is desiring to receive it.\n\nThe reason I am so firm about the necessity of getting the baptism in the Holy Spirit, and about the significance of the Spirit‘s making a manifestation when He comes in, is this: I fought it. I went to a meeting because I had heard people were speaking in tongues there. I forced myself on the attention of those in the meeting almost like a man who was mad. I told the people there, 433\n\n"This meeting of yours is nothing. I have left better conditions at home. I am hungry and thirsty for something."\n\n"What do you want?" they asked.\n\n"I want tongues."\n\n"You want the baptism?" they asked.\n\n"Not I," I said. "I have the baptism. I want tongues."\n\nI could have had a fight with anybody. The whole situation was this: God was training me for something else. The power of God fell upon my body with such ecstasy of joy that I could not satisfy the joy within with my natural tongue; then I found the Spirit speaking through me in other tongues.\n\nWhat did it mean? I knew that I had had anointings of joy before this, and expressions of the blessed attitude of the Spirit of life, and joy in the Holy Spirit; I had felt it all the way through my life. But when the fullness came with a high tide, with an overflowing life, I knew that was different from anything else. And I knew that was the baptism, but God had to show me.',
