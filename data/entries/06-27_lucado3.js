    "body": 'The tall one in the corner—that’s Peter. Galilee thickened his accent.\nFishing nets thickened his hands. Stubbornness thickened his skull. The guy picked to lead the next great work of God knows more about bass and boat docks than he does about Roman culture or Egyptian leaders. And his cronies: Andrew, James, Nathanael. Do they have any formal education?\nIn fact, what do they have? Humility? They argued over who would be Jesus’ top assistant. Sound theology? Peter told Jesus to forget the cross.\nLoyalty? When Jesus was arrested, they ran. Yet look at them six weeks later, acting like they’d just won tickets to the World Cup Finals. High fives and wide eyes. Wondering about Jesus’ final commission: “You will be my witnesses … to the ends of the earth” (Acts 1:8 NIV).\nYou hillbillies will be my witnesses. You uneducated and simple folk will be my witnesses. You who once called me crazy, who doubted me in the Upper Room. You will be my witnesses.\nHe’s speaking to the disciples. He’s also speaking to us. ',
