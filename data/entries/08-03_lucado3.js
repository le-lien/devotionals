    "body": 'Worship. In two thousand years we haven’t worked out how to do it. We still struggle for the right words in prayer. We still fumble over Scripture.\nWe don’t know when to kneel. We don’t know when to stand. We don’t know how to pray. Worship is tough stuff.\nFor that reason, God gave us the Psalms—a praise book for God’s people.\nThis collection of hymns and requests is strung together by one thread—a heart hungry for God. Some psalms are defiant. Others are reverent. Some are to be sung. Others are to be prayed. Some are intensely personal. Others are written as if the whole world would use them.\nThe very variety should remind us that worship is personal. No secret formula exists. What moves you may be a dead end for another. Some of us like to throw our hands in the air. Others of us close our eyes and silently reflect on God. Each of us worships differently. But each of us should worship. ',
