    "body": 'The Trinity—Father, Son, and Holy Ghost—is not your typical family. In fact, it might not make much sense to you. We talk about the Father and study the Son, but when it comes to the Holy Spirit, many of us are confused at best and frightened at worst. Confused because we’ve never been taught.\nFrightened because we’ve been taught to be afraid.\nMay I simplify things a bit? The Holy Spirit is the presence of God in our lives, carrying on the work of Jesus. The Holy Spirit helps us in three directions—inwardly (by granting us the fruits of the Spirit, Galatians 5:22–\n24), upwardly (by praying for us, Romans 8:26), and outwardly (by pouring God’s love into our hearts, Romans 5:5).\nWhen you invite God into your life, you invite the Spirit too. “And the Spirit himself joins with our spirits to say we are God’s children” (Romans 8:16 NCV). You might call it the best family reunion you’ve ever been to. ',
