    "body": 'Lazarus was three days dead in a sealed tomb when he heard a voice, lifted his head, and looked over his shoulder and saw Jesus standing. God had followed him into death.\nPeter had denied his Lord and gone back to fishing when he heard his name and looked over his shoulder and saw Jesus cooking breakfast. God had followed him in spite of his failure.\nGod is the God who follows. I wonder . . . have you sensed him following you? We often miss him… . But he comes.\nThrough the kindness of a stranger. The majesty of a sunset. The mystery of romance. Through the question of a child or the commitment of a spouse.\nThrough a word well spoken or a touch well timed, have you sensed his presence? ',
