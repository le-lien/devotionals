He was between an army and an ocean.\nIt wasn’t the latest medical research that convinced Naaman to dip seven times in the river. He was a very sick man without hope. It wasn’t common sense that caused Paul to abandon the Jewish laws he’d followed his whole life and follow Jesus instead. He simply couldn’t see any other way to go.\nAnd it wasn’t a bold bunch who prayed in a small room in Jerusalem for Peter’s release from prison. It was a frightened, desperate band of backed-into-a-corner believers. It was a church with no other choice. A bunch of have-nots begging for help. And they were never stronger. ',

Drop to your knees and pray about it. He may not show you the answer right away, but you can trust that He is working on it.'
