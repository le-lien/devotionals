    "body": 'To receive an invitation is to be honored— to be held in high esteem. For that reason all invitations deserve a kind and thoughtful response.\nBut the most incredible invitations are not found in envelopes or fortune cookies, they are found in the Bible. You can’t read about God without finding him issuing invitations. He invited Eve to marry Adam, the animals to enter the ark, David to be king, Israel to leave bondage, Nehemiah to rebuild Jerusalem. God is an inviting God. He invited Mary to birth his son, the disciples to fish for men, the adulterous woman to start over, and Thomas to touch his wounds. God is the King who prepares the palace, sets the table, and invites his subjects to come in.\nGod is a God who opens the door and waves his hand pointing pilgrims to a full table.\nHis invitation is not just for a meal, however, it is for life. An invitation to come into his kingdom… . Who can come? Whoever wishes. ',
