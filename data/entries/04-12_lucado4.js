The other two men are moaning on their crosses. The loud jeers of the crowd are finally silent.\nPerhaps there is thunder. Perhaps there is crying. Perhaps there is silence.\nThen Jesus draws a deep breath, pushes His feet downward on that Roman nail, and cries, “It is finished!”\nWhat was finished?\nGod’s plan for saving all of mankind was finished. The plan that had started all the way back in the garden of Eden was done at last. God had given His greatest gift to each of us. He had washed away our every sin and will one day take us home to heaven. And with that gift came God’s message of how very much He loves each and every one of us. ',
