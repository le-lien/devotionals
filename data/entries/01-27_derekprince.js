    "body": 'There is another precious provision made for us by the blood of Jesus, one of which many Christians are not aware. Hebrews 12:22, 24\nreads, “You [all true believers]  have come to Mount Zion…to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better things than that of Abel.”\nIn the heavenly Mount Zion, the blood of Jesus was sprinkled on our behalf in the Holy of Holies before the very presence of God. Christ entered this place as our forerunner, having obtained our eternal redemption through His sacrifice, and He sprinkled the evidence of that redemption in the very presence of Almighty God the Father.\nWe should notice an important contrast here. Early in history, Cain, the first son of Adam and Eve, murdered his brother, Abel. Cain then tried to deny responsibility, but the Lord challenged him and said,\n“There is no way you can conceal your guilt, because the blood of your brother that you shed on the earth is crying out to Me for vengeance.”\n(See Genesis 4:1–15.) In contrast, the blood of Jesus sprinkled in heaven cries out not for vengeance but for mercy. The blood is a continual plea in the very presence of God for His mercy.\nOnce we have testified personally to the power of the blood of Jesus, we do not have to repeat those words every few minutes, because the blood of Jesus is speaking all the time on our behalf in the very presence of God. Every time we are troubled, tempted, fearful, or anxious, we should remind ourselves, The blood of Jesus is speaking in God’s presence on my behalf at this very moment. ',
