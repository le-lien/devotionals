    "body": 'What a surprising way to describe God. A God who pursues us.\nDare we envision a mobile, active God who chases us, tracks us, following us with goodness and mercy all the days of our lives? He’s not hard to find. He’s there in Scripture, looking for Adam and Eve. They’re hiding in the bushes, partly to cover their bodies, partly to cover their sin. Does God wait for them to come to him? No, the words ring in the garden.“Where are you?” God asks (Gen.3:9), beginning his quest to redeem the heart of man. A quest to follow his children until his children follow him.',
