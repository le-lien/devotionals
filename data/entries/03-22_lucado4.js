    "body": 'Do you ever look at the world around you and wonder about some of the things that happen here? As you pray, do you ever wonder about things like … starving children, Christians with cancer, and why bad things happen to God’s people?\nThose are tough questions. They are probably a lot like the questions the disciples must have asked when they were in the middle of the sea during a storm: “Jesus, don’t You care?”\nAll they could see were black skies and black waves as they bounced in the battered boat. Then a figure came to them, walking on the water. It wasn’t what they expected, so they almost missed seeing the answer to their prayers.\nAnd unless you look and listen closely, you might make the same mistake. God’s answers are like the stars in the night sky—there are billions and billions of them. But some of them you just can’t see yet. ',
