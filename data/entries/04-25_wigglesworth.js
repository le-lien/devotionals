    "body": 'believe there are people who will be put in the place where they will have to stand upon God‘s Word. You will be sifted I as wheat (Luke 22:31). You will be tried “as though some strange thing happened to you”  (1 Pet. 4:12). You will be put in the most difficult places, where all hell seems to surround you, but God will sustain and empower you and will bring you into an unlimited place of faith. God will not allow you to be “tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear it” (1 Cor. 10:13).\n\nGod will surely tell you when you have been tried sufficiently in order to bring you out as pure gold. Every trial is to prepare you for a greater position for God. Who is going to live a dormant, weak, trifling, slow, indolent, prayerless, Bible-less life when he knows he must go through these things? And if you are to be “made perfect in weakness”  (2 Cor. 12:9), you must be tried as by fire in order to know that no man is able to win a victory unless the power of God is in him. The Holy Spirit will lead us day by day. You will know that these light afflictions, which are only for a moment, are working out for us an eternal weight of glory (2 Cor. 4:17).\n\nWe must have people receive the Holy Spirit; we must have people healed in their seats; we must see God come forth. Some of you have been longing for the Holy Spirit. God can baptize you just where you are. There may be some who have not yet tasted of the grace of God. Close beside you is the water of life. Have a drink, brother, sister, for God says, “And let him who thirsts come. Whoever desires, let him take the water of life freely”  (Rev. 22:17).',
