    "body": 'Deprive your body of necessary fluid, and your body will tell you.\nDeprive your soul of spiritual water, and your soul will tell you.\nDehydrated hearts send desperate messages. Snarling tempers. Waves of worry. Growling mastodons of guilt and fear. You think God wants you to live with these? Hopelessness. Sleeplessness. Loneliness. Resentment.\nIrritability. Insecurity. These are warnings. Symptoms of a dryness deep within.\nTreat your soul as you treat your thirst. Take a gulp. Imbibe moisture.\nFlood your heart with a good swallow of water.\nWhere do you find water for the soul? “If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.” ',
