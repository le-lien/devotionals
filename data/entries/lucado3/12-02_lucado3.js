He uses our struggles to build character.\nJames makes the point in the Bible. “When troubles come your way, consider it an opportunity for great joy. For you know that when your faith is tested, your endurance has a chance to grow. So let it grow, for when your endurance is fully developed, you will be perfect and complete, needing nothing” (James 1:2–4 NLT).\nToday’s trial makes you better and stronger tomorrow. Hasn’t the oyster taught us this principle? The grain of sand invades the shell, and how does the oyster respond? Does he shell out a bunch of money on a shopping binge to get over the pain? No. He emits the substance that transforms the irritation into a pearl. Every pearl is simply a victory over irritations.\nHow do we handle our hassles in the meantime? We trust, remembering that “in everything God works for the good of those who love him” (Romans 8:28 NCV). ',
