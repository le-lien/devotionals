    "body": 'When Francis of Asissi turned his back on wealth to seek God in simplicity, he took off his robes and walked out of the city. He soon encountered a leper on the side of the road. He passed him, then stopped and went back and hugged the diseased man. Francis then continued on his journey. After a few steps he turned to look again at the leper, but no one was there.\nFor the rest of his life, he believed the leper was Jesus Christ. He may have been right.\nJesus lives in the forgotten. He has taken up residence in the ignored. He has made a mansion in the middle of the sick. Do you know of anyone who’s forgotten, ignored, or sick? An elderly neighbor? A teen who seems to have no friends? A friend’s mom, dealing with cancer? If you want to see God, you must go among the broken and beaten, and there you will see him. ',
