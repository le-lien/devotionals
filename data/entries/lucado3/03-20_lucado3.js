Isn’t it incredible that God leaves the choice to us?\nThink about it. There are many things in life we can’t choose. We can’t, for example, choose the weather. We can’t choose whether or not we are born with a big nose or blue eyes or a lot of hair. Can’t choose our parents either.\nWe can’t choose the school lunch menu. We can’t even choose who will laugh at our jokes.\nBut we can choose where we spend eternity. The big choice, God leaves to us. It means more to him, and us, when we have the freedom to make up our own mind. Will you ever make a more important choice? It’s the only decision that really matters. ',

      "text": 'How do you make your most important decisions? Do you list pros and cons on a piece of paper? Ask your friends and parents? Flip a coin? The choice on whether or not to give your heart to God isn’t like picking a color for your cell-phone case. It’s the biggest decision you’ll ever make.'
