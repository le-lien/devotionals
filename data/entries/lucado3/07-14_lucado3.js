    "body": 'Clothing can symbolize character. The Bible often describes our behavior as the clothes we wear. Peter urges us to be “clothed with humility” (1 Peter 5:5). David speaks of evil people who clothe themselves “with cursing”\n(Psalm 109:18).\nWhat character are you wearing? Who are you when no one is looking?\nDo you adjust your character wardrobe to fit in with the crowd you happen to be with, or are you the same person in each situation? People of good and godly character are truthful, faithful, trustworthy, kind, helpful, and respectful no matter who they’re with or where they are.\nWhat does this look like? The life of Jesus. The character of Christ never changed, even when he faced execution. We know that Jesus wore a tunic that was “seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom” (John 19:23 NLT). It matched his character. Seamless. Coordinated. Unified. He was like his robe: uninterrupted perfection. The perfect model for us. ',
