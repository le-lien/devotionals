    "body": 'Jesus’ obedience began in a small town carpentry shop. His uncommon approach to his common life prepared him for his uncommon call. “When Jesus entered public life he was about thirty years old” (Luke 3:23 MSG). In order for Jesus to change the world, he had to say good-bye to his world.\nHe had to give Mary a kiss. Have a final meal in the kitchen, a final walk through the streets. Did he ascend one of the hills of Nazareth and think of the day he would ascend the hill near Jerusalem?\nHe knew what was going to happen. “God chose him as your ransom long before the world began” (1 Peter 1:20 NLT). Every ounce of suffering had been scripted—it just fell to him to play the part.\nNot that he had to. Nazareth was a cozy town. Why not build a carpentry business? Keep his identity a secret? To be forced to die is one thing, but to willingly take up your own cross is something else. ',

      "text": 'You may think that because Jesus is Lord, it was easy for him to give up his life on Calvary. Not so. Because Jesus chose to be human, he suffered on the cross just as you or I would. What’s really amazing is that he knew what was coming and did it anyway. For us.'
