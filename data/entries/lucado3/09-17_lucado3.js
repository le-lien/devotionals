    "body": 'Our globe’s weight has been estimated at six sextillion (that’s a six with twenty-one zeroes!) tons. Yet it is precisely tilted at twenty-three degrees; any more or any less and our seasons would be lost in a melted polar flood.\nAlthough our globe revolves at the rate of one thousand miles per hour or twenty-five thousand miles per day or nine million miles per year, none of us tumbles into orbit.\nAs you stand observing God’s workshop, let me pose a few questions. If he is able to place the stars in their sockets and suspend the sky like a curtain, do you think it is remotely possible that God is able to guide your life? If your God is mighty enough to ignite the sun, could it be that he is mighty enough to light your path? If he cares enough about the planet Saturn to give it rings or Venus to make it sparkle, is there an outside chance that he cares enough about you to meet your needs?\nEver wonder about God’s ability to influence your life? The answer is in his workshop. ',
