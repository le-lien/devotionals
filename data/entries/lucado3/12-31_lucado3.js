    "body": 'The birth of Jesus in the manger is more, much more, than a Christmas story; it is a picture of how close Christ will come to you. The first stop on his journey was a womb. Where will God go to touch the world? Look deep within Mary for an answer.\nBetter still, look deep within yourself. What he did with Mary, he offers to us! He issues a Mary-level invitation to all his children. “If you’ll let me, I’ll move in!” What is the mystery of the gospel? “Christ in you, the hope of glory” (Colossians 1:27 NIV).\nChrist grew in Mary until he had to come out. Christ will grow in you until the same thing happens. He will come out in your speech, in your actions, in your decisions. Every place you live will be a Bethlehem, and every day you live will be a Christmas. You, like Mary, will deliver Christ into the world. ',

For you and me, every day can be Christmas. Let’s present the world with the greatest gift of all: Jesus.

Reading the Bible Your teachers may pile on the reading assignments, but the Bible is the most important book you will ever read. It’s God’s plan for your life, telling you what is right, what is wrong, and how to get to heaven. When life comes at you fast and hard, the Bible can be your answer book, so it’s a good idea to read something from it every day. Try one of these reading plans to help you get started. Put a check next to each one as you read it. 30 Days with Jesus walks you through the life of Jesus while he was here on earth. 90 Days Through the Bible gives you all the major happenings of the Old and New Testaments, beginning with the Creation in Genesis and going all the way through to Revelation. 30 Days with Jesus 1.
