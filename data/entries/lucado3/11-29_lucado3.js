    "body": 'Afriend slides a beer bottle in your direction. A classmate offers a marijuana joint. Your mind seeks ways to explain and excuse, the reasons popping up like weeds after a summer rain. It won’t hurt anyone. I won’t get caught. I’m only human.\nYou’ve heard so many messages about the evils of drinking and drugs that your head is ready to explode. But could there be some truth behind the endless words of warning? You better believe it. I’ve seen it in my own family. “Just one drink” makes it easier to say yes again the next night. Two hits become a habit. A habit turns into addiction and a life you can’t control.\nOf course, that happens to other people, not you. But what if the example of your one drink helps lead a friend into a life of alcoholism? How might that one joint hurt the heart of the Father watching over you?\nDo everyone a favor. Trade the one drink for the wisdom of the One. ',
