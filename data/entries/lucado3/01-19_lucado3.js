    "body": 'We understand how storms are created. We map solar systems and transplant hearts. We measure the depths of the oceans and send signals to distant planets. We have studied our universe and are learning how it works.\nAnd, for some, the loss of mystery has led to the loss of majesty. The more we know, the less we believe. Strange, don’t you think? Knowledge of how things work shouldn’t cancel out wonder. Knowledge should stir wonder.\nWho has more reason to worship than the astronomer who has seen the stars?\nIronically, the more we know, the less we worship. We are more impressed with our discovery of the light switch than with the One who invented electricity. Rather than worship the Creator, we worship the creation (Romans 1:25).\nNo wonder there is no wonder. We think we’ve figured it all out. My advice? Don’t lose the wonder. ',
