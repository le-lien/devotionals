    "body": 'There are some who position themselves between you and God. There are some who suggest the only way to get to God is through them. There is the great teacher who has the final word on Bible teaching. There is the father who must bless your acts. There is the spiritual leader who will tell you what God wants you to do. Jesus’ message for complicated religion is to remove these middlemen. “You have only one Master, the Christ” (Matthew 23:10\nNCV).\nHe’s not saying that you don’t need teachers, elders, or counselors. He is saying, however, that we are all brothers and sisters and have equal access to the Father. Simplify your faith by seeking God for yourself. No confusing ceremonies necessary. No mysterious rituals required. No complicated channels of command or levels of access.\nYou have a Bible? You can study. You have a mind? You can think. You have a heart? You can pray. And God welcomes it. ',

      "text": 'It’s one of the wonderful paradoxes of the Christian faith—incredible, life-changing power in a simple message. Jesus asks us to confess our sin and believe in him. Having a relationship with him is just as simple. Study his Word. Think about what it means. Talk to him in prayer.'
