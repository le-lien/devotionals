    "body": 'The Greek word for compassion is splanchnizomai, which won’t mean much to you unless you’re taking Introduction to “Splanchnology” at school. If so, you know that “splanchnology” is a study of … the gut.\nWhen Matthew writes that Jesus had compassion on the people, he is not saying that Jesus felt casual pity or a little bit sorry for them. No, the term is far more graphic and intense. Matthew is saying that Jesus felt their hurt in his gut. He felt the limp of the crippled. He felt the hurt of the diseased. He felt the loneliness of the leper. He felt the embarrassment of the sinful.\nJesus has felt everything you’ve felt and then some. Rejection.\nHumiliation. Torture. Execution with nails on a cross. When you allow him into your heart, he feels your pain too. And once he feels your hurts, he can’t help but heal them. ',
