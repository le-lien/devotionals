Most of our sacrifices don’t cost us much. God, on the other hand, gave up what he loved most.\nWhen God gave us his Son, his Son gave up heaven. Try to imagine that sacrifice. What if you left your home to become homeless or left the human race to become a mosquito? Would that be comparable to God’s becoming human?\nThen there is Christ on the cross. Although he was without sin, he paid the price for our sin by taking it on himself. We’ve always been sinners, so can any of us understand this sacrifice?\nI’ve never given my child to evil people. I might give part of myself to help evil people. But sacrifice one of my daughters? No way. Even if I knew I would see her again, I wouldn’t do it. But God did. Seems to me that God gave more than we could ever ask. ',
