    "body": 'Resentment is the cocaine of the emotions. It causes our blood to pump and our energy level to rise. But, also like cocaine, it demands increasingly larger and more frequent dosages. There is a dangerous point at which anger ceases to be an emotion and becomes a driving force. A person bent on revenge moves unknowingly further and further away from being able to forgive, for to be without the anger is to be without a source of energy.\nDo you know someone caught in this trap, always angry, always plotting how to get back at someone? Are you there yourself? This is why the Bible tells us, “Don’t get so angry that you sin. Don’t go to bed angry” (Ephesians 4:26 CEV).\nHatred is the rabid dog that turns on its owner. Revenge is the raging fire that consumes the arsonist. Bitterness is the trap that snares the hunter.\nAnd mercy is the choice that can set them all free. ',
