    "body": 'Dig deep enough in every heart and you’ll find it: a longing for meaning, a quest for purpose. As surely as a child breathes, he will someday wonder, What is the purpose of my life?\nSome search for meaning in a career. “My purpose is to be a dentist.”\nFine job, but hardly a reason for living. They choose to be human “doings”\nrather than human “beings.” Who they are is what they do; consequently they do a lot. They work many hours because if they don’t work, they don’t have an identity.\nFor others, who they are is what they have. They find meaning in a new car or a new laptop or new clothes. These people are great for the economy and rough on the budget because they are always seeking meaning in something they own. Some try sports, movies, drugs, friends, sex, you name it. All mirages in the desert of purpose.\nShouldn’t we face the truth instead? Our purpose is to love God. Nothing else will satisfy. ',
