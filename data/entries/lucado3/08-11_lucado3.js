    "body": 'Venture away from the city lights on a clear night, and look up at the sky.\nThat fuzzy band of white light is our galaxy, the Milky Way. One hundred billion stars. 8 Our galaxy is one of billions of others! 9 Who can conceive of such a universe, let alone infinite numbers of universes?\nNo one can. But let’s try anyway. Suppose you board a jet and zip through our solar system at a blistering six hundred miles per hour. In 16.5\ndays you’ll reach the moon, in seventeen years you’ll pass the sun, and in 690\nyears you can enjoy dinner on Pluto. After seven centuries you haven’t even left our solar system, much less our galaxy.10\nOur universe is God’s finest missionary. “The heavens declare the glory of God” (Psalm 19:1 NIV). A house implies a builder; a painting suggests a painter. Don’t stars suggest a star maker? Doesn’t creation imply a creator?\nLook above you.\nIf God can make a billion galaxies, can’t he make good out of our bad and make sense out of our faltering lives? Of course he can. He is God. ',

      "text": 'Choose a clear night—maybe tonight. Find a spot where you can really see all those stars. Give them a good look—not just a glance, but a penetrating gaze. Do you think they just “happened” into existence? Or do you think God had something to do with it? Search your heart for your answer.'
