    "body": 'Some of us (most of us?) find it hard to forgive the people who bring pain to our lives. We forgive the one-time offenders, mind you. We dismiss the parking-place takers and date breakers. We can move past the misdemeanors, but the felonies? The repeat offenders? The ones who take our friends, our virginity, our parents?\nCan you forgive the scum who hurt you?\nFailure to do so could be fatal. “Resentment kills a fool, and envy slays the simple” (Job 5:2 NIV). Vengeance fixes your attention at life’s ugliest moments. Score-settling freezes your stare at cruel events in your past. Is this where you want to look? Will rehearsing and reliving your hurts make you a better person?\nBy no means. It will destroy you. An eye for an eye becomes a neck for a neck and a reputation for a reputation. When does it stop? It stops when one person imitates God. ',
