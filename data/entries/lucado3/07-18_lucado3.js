    "body": 'God hates arrogance. He hates to see his children fall. God hates what pride does to his children. He doesn’t dislike arrogance. He hates it. Could he state it any clearer than Proverbs 8:13: “I hate pride and arrogance” (NIV)?\nAnd then a few chapters later: “GOD can’t stomach arrogance or pretense; believe me, he’ll put those upstarts in their place” (16:5 MSG).\nYou don’t want God to do that. It’s far wiser to climb down the mountain than to fall from it.\nPursue humility. Humility doesn’t mean you think less of yourself but that you think of yourself less. “Don’t cherish exaggerated ideas of yourself or your importance, but try to have a sane estimate of your capabilities by the light of the faith that God has given to you” (Romans 12:3 PHILLIPS).\nResist the place of celebrity. “Go sit in a seat that is not important. When the host comes to you, he may say, ‘Friend, move up here to a more important place.’ Then all the other guests will respect you” (Luke 14:10 NCV).\nWouldn’t you rather be invited up than put down?
