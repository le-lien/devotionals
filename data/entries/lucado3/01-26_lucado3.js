The question. “But who do you say that I am?”\nHe doesn’t ask, “What do you think about what I’ve done?” He asks,\n“Who do you say that I am?” He doesn’t ask, “Who do your friends think?\nWho do your parents think? Who do your peers think?” Instead, the question is intensely personal. “Who do you think I am?”\nYou have been asked some important questions in your life: Will you go to the dance with me? How do you feel about moving to Alaska? What do you want to do after you graduate from high school?\nYes, you’ve been asked some important questions. But the grandest of them is an anthill compared to the Everest found in the eighth chapter of Mark. Who do you say that I am?  Your answer will be life-changing. It will decide your future forever.

      "text": 'We answer questions all day long. What do you want for breakfast? What is the capital of Panama? Do you like him? But none compares to Jesus’ question: “Who do you say that I am?” If you’re not sure of your answer, read again about his life in the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. This is one answer you need to get right.'
