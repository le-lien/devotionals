    "body": 'Thomas came with doubts. Did Christ turn him away? Moses had his reservations. Did God tell him to go home? Job had his struggles. Did God avoid him? Paul had his hard times. Did God abandon him?\nNo. God never turns away the sincere heart. Tough questions don’t stump God. He invites our probing.\nMaybe you’re wondering why God seems to stand aside when so many terrible things happen. Why he allows temptation. Why he seemed to disappear last month when you needed him. Whether you can truly trust and believe in him.\nMark it down. God never turns away the honest seeker. “If any of you needs wisdom, you should ask God for it” (James 1:5 NCV). Go to God with your questions. Read his Word. If you’re patient, he will point you to the answers you seek. The bonus will be a deeper, richer, stronger faith. ',

It comes with seeking and growing in Jesus day by day. JUNE What we see will last only a short time, but what we cannot see will last forever. [ 2 Corinthians 4:18 NCV]'
