    "body": 'Have you ever wondered how Jesus kept from striking back at the mob that killed him? Have you ever asked how he kept control? Here’s the answer.\nIt’s this statement: “for they do not know what they are doing.” Look carefully. It’s as if Jesus considered this bloodthirsty, death-hungry crowd not as murderers, but as victims. It’s as if he saw in their faces not hatred but confusion. It’s as if he regarded them not as a militant mob but, as he put it,\n“sheep without a shepherd” (Mark 6:34 NIV).\n“They don’t know what they are doing.” When you think about it, they didn’t. They were mad at something they couldn’t see so they took it out on—\nof all people—God.\nMaybe you know someone like this. Someone who wants to harm you, filled with anger and hate. Maybe you can see this person as Jesus does.\nSomeone lost, a sheep without a shepherd. Someone who doesn’t know what he or she is doing. Someone loved by God. ',

      "text": 'When someone is insulting you, shouting at you, or even trying to hit you, it’s pretty tough to keep from striking back. The trick is to see what’s behind the attack. Is it fear? Lack of faith? Just plain ignorance? Whatever the case, Jesus loves this person just as much as he loves you.'
