You may think you’ve peaked, that your character and faith won’t develop any further, that you’ll never amount to more than you are now, that you’ll never accomplish much. You may think God’s got someone else in mind for the important jobs. If so, think again.\n“God began doing a good work in you, and I am sure he will continue it until it is finished when Jesus Christ comes again” (Philippians 1:6 NCV).\nDid you see what God is doing? A good work in you. Did you see when he will be finished? When Jesus comes again.\nYou can’t yet know what God is doing and will do with you. He’s still shaping you on the inside to bring glory to him on the outside. You can’t imagine the wonders he has planned. God’s not finished with you yet. ',

God has more happy surprises in store for you, both in who you are and what you’ll do. Let him do his wonderful work.'
