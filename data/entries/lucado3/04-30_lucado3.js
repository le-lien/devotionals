When your dad loses his job or your friend’s family loses their home … do such moments serve a purpose?\nThey do if we see them from an eternal perspective. I have proof: you in the womb. In that prebirth season, your bones solidified, your eyes developed, the umbilical cord transported nutrients into your growing frame … for what reason? Womb time equipped you for earth time.\nSome of your new features went unused before birth. You grew a nose but didn’t breathe. Eyes developed, but could you see? Your tongue, toenails, and crop of hair served no function then. But aren’t you glad you have them now?\nCertain chapters in this life seem so unnecessary, like nostrils on the preborn. Suffering. Loneliness. Disease. Heartbreak. But what if this earth is the womb? Might these challenges serve to prepare us for the world to come?\nAs Paul wrote, “These little troubles are getting us ready for an eternal glory”\n(2 Corinthians 4:17 CEV). ',

They will serve a purpose—if not in this life, then certainly in the next. MAY Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my way. [ Psalm 119:105 ]'
