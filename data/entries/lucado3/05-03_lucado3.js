You sound like one of the disciples of Jesus.\nWe need to remember that Peter, John, Matthew, and the rest were common men given an incredible task. Before they were the stained-glassed saints in the windows of cathedrals, they were somebody’s next-door neighbors trying to make a living and raise a family. They weren’t standout students from seminaries or superheroes of faith. They struggled to follow Jesus, sometimes literally walking on water, sometimes falling in. But they were an ounce more devoted than they were afraid and, as a result, did some extraordinary things. Things that changed the world: “You gave them to me and they have obeyed your word” (John 17:6 NIV).\nWhat in this world are you afraid of? Failure? Someone making fun of you? Answer the big question of eternity and you’ll realize that earthly fears are no fears at all. ',
