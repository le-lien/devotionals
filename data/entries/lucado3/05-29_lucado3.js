    "body": 'Sheep aren’t smart. They tend to wander into running creeks for water, then their wool grows heavy and they drown. They need a shepherd to lead them to “calm water” (Psalm 23:2 NCV). They have no natural defense—no claws, no horns, no fangs. They’re helpless. Sheep need a shepherd with a\n“rod and … shepherd’s staff” to protect them (v. 4 NCV). They have no sense of direction. They need someone to lead them “on paths that are right” (v. 3\nNCV).\nSo do we. We like to talk about how smart we are, how strong we are, how independent we are. But we, too, tend to be swept away by waters we should have avoided. We have no defense against the evil lion that prowls about seeking someone to devour. We, too, get lost.\nWe need a shepherd. We need a shepherd to care for us and to guide us.\nAnd we have One. ',
