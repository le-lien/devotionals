    "body": 'Grace is precious because Jesus is. Grace changes lives because he does.\nGrace secures us because he will.\nTo discover grace is to discover God’s total devotion to you, his stubborn desire to give you a cleansing, healing, purging love that lifts the wounded back to their feet. Does he stand high on a hill and tell you to climb out of the valley? No. He bungees down and carries you out. Does he build a bridge and command you to cross it? No. He crosses the bridge and shoulders you over.\nThis is the gift that God gives. A grace that grants us first the power to receive love and then the power to give it. A grace that changes us, shapes us, and leads us to a life that is forever altered. Do you know this grace? Do you trust this grace? If not, you can. All God wants from us is faith. Put your faith in God. ',
