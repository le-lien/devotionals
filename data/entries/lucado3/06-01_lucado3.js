Even if you’ve worried each day of your life, you needn’t worry the rest of your life. So what if you were born a snob? You don’t have to die one.\nWhere did we get the idea we can’t change? Where did statements such as “It’s just my nature to worry” or “I’ll always be pessimistic. I’m just that way” come from? Would we say that about our bodies? “It’s just my nature to have a broken leg. I can’t do anything about it.” Of course not. If our bodies malfunction, we seek help. Shouldn’t we do the same with our hearts?\nShouldn’t we seek help for our sour attitudes? Can’t we request treatment for our selfish tirades?\nOf course we can. Jesus can change our hearts. He wants us to have a heart like his. ',
