    "body": 'Jesus saw people enslaved by their fear of death. He explained that the river of death was nothing to fear. The people wouldn’t believe him. He touched a boy and called him back to life. The followers were still unconvinced. He whispered life into the dead body of a girl. The people were still cynical. He let a dead man spend four days in a grave and then called him out. Is that enough?\nApparently not. It was necessary for him to enter the river and submerge himself in the water of death before people would believe that death had been conquered.\nBut after he did, after he came out on the other side of death’s river, it was time to sing … it was time to celebrate!\nAre you afraid of death’s river? Don’t be. Jesus shows us that there is a bank on the other side, and that he has the power to take us there. ',
