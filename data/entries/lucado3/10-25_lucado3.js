    "body": 'Do your parents doubt your dreams? I’m not talking about the ones when you’re asleep, but the ones when your eyes are open. Dreams like wanting to be a dancer, diver, or diplomat, a doctor serving the poor or a missionary serving in Malaysia. Without their support, it feels impossible.\nWe forget that impossible is one of God’s favorite words. He dreams impossible dreams. Why? If you accomplish a possible dream, then you get all the glory. But if you accomplish an impossible dream, then God gets the glory. It shows the world that an incredible, unbelievable God still exists and works in the lives of people. It begins with dreams like yours.\nAlthough it may seem your parents are dousing your passion, they could just be injecting some much-needed wisdom into your plans. Practicality and logic aren’t all bad. Doubt may be caution in disguise.\nIn the end you must ask yourself, whose dream am I going to follow: mine, my parents’, or God’s? God’s dreams are always bigger, better, and more unbelievable. ',

      "text": 'Yes, parents can be a drag on dreams. But they usually mean well! Keep talking to them, and to God, about your goals. Mix in a heavy dose of patience and perseverance. If God is behind your dream, it will happen in his timing. If not, he has something even better in mind.'
