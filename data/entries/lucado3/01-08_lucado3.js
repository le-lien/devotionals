Love all and loved by all. Is that you? Or maybe you have no fears. Failing French—no problem. Heart condition discovered—\nyawn. Just call you Superman. Does that describe you? Or maybe you need no forgiveness. Never made a mistake. As square as a game of checkers. As clean as Grandma’s kitchen. Is that you? No?\nLet’s evaluate this. A few of your relationships are shaky. You have fears and faults. Do you really want to walk through life all on your own? The trail ahead looks tough. Sounds to me as if you could use a shepherd. “Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me” (Psalm 23:4 NIV). ',
