We drum our fingers while the song downloads or the microwave heats our burrito. “Come on, come on.” We want sixpack abs in ten minutes and minute rice in thirty seconds. We don’t like to wait. Not on the doctor, the traffic, the pizza.\nNot on God?\nYou may be waiting for a new room, a new job, a new friend, a new direction. If so, here is what you need to know. While you wait, God works.\n“My Father is always at his work,” Jesus said (John 5:17 NIV). God never twiddles his thumbs. He never stops. He takes no vacations. He rested on the seventh day, but got back to work on the eighth and hasn’t stopped since. Just because you are idle, don’t assume God is. He knows just what you need and just when you need it. ',
