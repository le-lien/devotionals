    "body": 'Can God run out of grace?\nPlunge a sponge into Lake Erie. Did you absorb every drop? Take a deep breath. Did you suck the oxygen out of the atmosphere? Pluck a pine needle from a tree in Yosemite. Did you wipe out the forest’s foliage? Watch an ocean wave crash against the beach. Will there never be another?\nOf course there will. No sooner will one wave crash into the sand than another appears. Then another, then another. This is a picture of God’s never-ending grace. Grace is simply another word for his tumbling, rumbling reservoir of strength and protection. It comes at us not in occasional drips but in titanic torrents, wave upon wave. We’ve barely regained our balance from one breaker, and then, bam, here comes another.\n“Grace upon grace” (John 1:16 NASB). We dare to stake our hope on the gladdest news of all: if God permits the challenge, he will provide the grace to meet it. ',
