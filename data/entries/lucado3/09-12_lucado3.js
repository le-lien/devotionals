    "body": 'When [the disciples] saw who he was, he disappeared. They said to each other, ‘It felt like a fire burning in us when Jesus talked to us on the road and explained the Scriptures to us’” (Luke 24:31–32 NCV).\nDon’t you love that verse? They knew they had been with Jesus because of the fire within them. God reveals his will by setting a torch to your soul.\nHe gave Jeremiah a fire for hard hearts. He gave Nehemiah a fire for a forgotten city. He set Abraham on fire for a land he’d never seen. He set Isaiah on fire with a vision he couldn’t resist. Forty years of unproductive preaching didn’t put out the fire of Noah.\nMark it down: Jesus comes to set you on fire! He walks as a torch from heart to heart, warming the cold and thawing the chilled and stirring the ashes.\nFollowing Christ is not some dull, endless journey. It is an exciting quest for your destiny. Feel the heat—he’s already on his way! ',

      "text": 'Some people think that being a Christian is boring, that it’s sitting in church and memorizing ancient ideas. They just don’t get it. God’s love and power and passion will spread within you like a wildfire. There’s no thrill like marching with Jesus! It is life itself.'
