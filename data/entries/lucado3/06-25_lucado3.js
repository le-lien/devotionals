    "body": 'God loves to give. He “gives generously to all without finding fault” (James 1:5 NIV). He lavishes us with love (1 John 3:1). He is rich in “kindness, forbearance and patience” (Romans 2:4 NIV). His grace is “exceedingly abundant” (1 Timothy 1:14) and “indescribable” (2 Corinthians 9:15). He turned a few bread loaves and fish into food for five thousand, changed water at a wedding into wine, and overflowed the boat of Peter with fish, twice. He healed all who sought health, taught all who wanted instruction, and saved all who accepted the gift of salvation.\nPicture him at the center of the circle, a huge smile on his face, teaching you the latest dance step. When God gives, he dances for joy. He strikes up the band and leads the giving parade.\nGod dispenses his goodness not with an eyedropper but a fire hydrant.\nYou simply can’t contain it all. So let it bubble over. Spill out. Pour forth. And enjoy the flood. ',

      "text": 'Today, try giving an unexpected gift to someone you know. It might be that scarf your sister likes or the picked-up bedroom your mom keeps talking about. Notice the smile it triggers on her face. Notice the pleasure it triggers in you. It’s a tiny glimpse of the joy God feels when he gives to you.'
