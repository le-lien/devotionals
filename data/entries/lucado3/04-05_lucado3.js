You consider the demands of the journey and pack accordingly. Cold weather? Bring a jacket. Class project? Carry the laptop. Time with your friend who’s a running fanatic?\nBetter take some sneakers and a bucketful of water.\nGod did the same with you. Joe will research animals . . . install curiosity. Meagan will lead a private school . . . an extra dose of management. I need Eric to comfort the sick . . . include a healthy share of compassion. Denalyn will marry Max … instill a double portion of patience.\nGod has a wonderful plan in mind for you. But he wouldn’t send you on this expedition without the proper preparation. He packed you on purpose for a purpose. ',
