I don’t blame you for being upset, but here’s a little tip that might help you keep things in perspective: it wasn’t yours anyway.\nWhat am I talking about? Try this, and you’ll see what I mean. Grab some sticky notes and stick one on everything in your life that you won’t be taking with you when you go to heaven someday. Go ahead—look in your bedroom, house, yard, garage. The clothes, the DVDs, the books, the game controllers, even the stuffed monkey you’ve had since you were two. Once you’ve finished, what’s left? Your friends. Your church. The Word of God.\nYour family (including your little brother).\nAll that stuff? You don’t get to keep it. You never had it. You own nothing. You are simply a caretaker of what God’s given you. “The earth is the LORD’S, and everything in it. The world and all its people belong to him”\n(Psalm 24:1 NLT). If he’s not too concerned about a dropped cell phone, maybe you shouldn’t be either. ',
