    "body": 'Some of us have trouble with daily quiet times with God. There are so many distractions. We have a hard time concentrating. And we’re so busy. So rather than spend time with God, listening for his voice, we let others spend time with him and then rely on their experience. Let them tell us what God is saying. After all, isn’t that what preachers get paid to do? And what are spiritual friends for?\nIf that’s your approach, if your spiritual experiences are secondhand and not firsthand, I’d like to challenge you with this thought: Do you do that with other parts of your life? You don’t let friends use your concert tickets and tell you about it later. You don’t let someone eat on your behalf. You certainly don’t send a friend to the dance with your date, do you?\nThere are certain things no one can do for you. One of those is spending time with God. ',

      "text": 'How would you feel if your best friend never spent time with you, if she just talked to your other friends to find out what you’re doing? Would you feel ignored? Disrespected? Hurt? Now imagine how God feels when you leave him out of your life. Let’s make faith a firsthand experience.'
