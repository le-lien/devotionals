    "body": 'Jonathan and David were best friends. “The soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul” (1 Samuel 18:1).\nAs if the two hearts were two fabrics, God “needle and threaded” them together. So interwoven that when one moved, the other felt it.\nDo you have a friend like Jonathan? Someone who protects you, who seeks nothing but your interests, wants nothing but your happiness? An ally who lets you be you? A person you feel safe with? God gave David such a friend.\nHe gave you one as well. Has Jesus not made a promise to you? “I am with you always, even to the end of the age” (Matthew 28:20). Has he not clothed you? He offers you “white garments, that you may be clothed”\n(Revelation 3:18). Christ dresses you in clothing suitable for heaven.\nMake a mental list of all the ways he shows you his kindness. Everything from sunsets to salvation—look at what you have. Allow Jesus to be knit to your soul. Let him be your best friend. ',

      "text": 'A personal relationship with Jesus is a bit different from your other friendships. For one thing, you can’t physically see him. Yet he’s certainly there, speaking to you through his words in the Bible, encouraging you through the actions of others. So talk to him. Pray to him. Worship him. He can truly be your best friend.'
