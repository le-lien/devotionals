Paul tells us that a man who won’t feed his own family is worse than an unbeliever (1 Timothy 5:8).\nHow much more will a holy God care for his children? After all, how can we carry out his mission for us unless our needs are met? How can we teach or help or tell others about Jesus unless we have our basic needs satisfied? Will God enlist us in his army and not provide meals? Of course not.\n“I pray that the God of peace will give you every good thing you need so you can do what he wants” (Hebrews 13:21 NCV). Hasn’t that prayer been answered in our lives? We may not have had a feast, but haven’t we always had food? (Yes, school lunches count as food.) Perhaps there was no banquet, but at least there was bread. And many times there was so much more. God takes care of us every day. ',
