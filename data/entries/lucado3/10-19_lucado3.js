    "body": 'Jesus understands the frenzy of life. People back-to-backed his calendar with demands. They brought Jesus more than sick bodies and seeking souls.\nThey brought him agendas. Itineraries. Unsolicited advice.\nThey do the same with you. Look over your shoulder, my friend. The crowd is one step back. Moreover, they seem to know more about your life than you do. Who you should hang out with. What you should study. Where you should spend your Saturday. Your mental hard drive is full already!\nFollow the example of Jesus. “Now when it was day, He departed and went into a deserted place” (Luke 4:42). Deserted doesn’t necessarily mean desolate, just quiet. Jesus was after peace. “I need to get away. To think. To ponder. To rechart my course.” He determined the time, selected a place. With resolve, he pressed the pause button on his life.\nGod rested after six days of work, and the world didn’t collapse. What makes us think it will if we do? ',
