    "body": 'When you slurp a chocolate milkshake and say, “This is good,” what are you saying? The machine with the ice cream is good? The ice cream itself is good? The chocolate syrup is good? The milk? The cup? The straw?\nNo, none of these. Good happens when the ingredients are worked together: the machine churns out the ice cream, chocolate and milk are added, the whole concoction is stirred in a cup, and you get to enjoy it through a straw. It is the collective cooperation of the elements that creates good.\nNothing in the Bible would cause us to call a famine good or a heart attack good or a terrorist attack good. These are catastrophes. Yet every message in the Bible compels us to believe that God will mix them with other ingredients and bring good out of them.\nBut we must let God define good. Our definition includes health, success, and popularity. His definition? In the case of his Son, the good life consisted of struggle, storms, and death. But God worked it all together for the greatest of good: his glory and our salvation. ',

      "text": 'Our lives are a little like a milkshake. Ingredients get mixed together. Some of the ingredients are unimpressive by themselves. Some—rejections, disappointments, failures—are awful at the time. Yet God shakes them up and pours them out into a concoction that is delicious and good.'
