So use your body to honor God” (1 Corinthians 6:19–20 CEV).\nUse your body to grab attention? Too-tight tops and shorter-than-short shorts? No. Use your body to honor God. “Use your whole body as an instrument to do what is right for the glory of God” (Romans 6:13 NLT). Your body is God’s instrument, intended for his work and for his glory.\nUse your body for short-term pleasures with long-term consequences?\nDoughnuts for dinner every evening? Drinking parties on weekends? No.\nMaintain God’s instrument. Feed it. Care for it. Rest it. When he needs a sturdy implement—a servant who is rested enough to serve, fueled enough to work, alert enough to think—let him find one in you.\nYour body, God’s tool. Maintain it. Your body, God’s temple. Respect it.\n“God owns the whole works. So let people see God in and through your body” (1 Corinthians 6:20 MSG). ',
