    "body": 'God always rejoices when we dare to dream. In fact, we are much like God when we dream. The Master exults in newness. He delights in stretching the old. He wrote the book on making the impossible possible.\nExamples? Check the Bible. Eighty-year-old shepherds don’t usually play chicken with Pharaohs . . . but don’t tell that to Moses. Teenage shepherds don’t normally have showdowns with giants … but don’t tell that to David.\nNight-shift shepherds don’t usually get to hear angels sing and see God in a stable … but don’t tell that to the Bethlehem bunch.\nAnd for sure don’t tell that to God. He’s made an eternity out of making the earthbound airborne. And he gets angry when people’s wings are clipped.\nSo go ahead and give your dreams to God. Watch him turn them from barely visible ideas into a reality beyond your wildest dreams. ',
