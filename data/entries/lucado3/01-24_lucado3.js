    "body": 'Last night during family devotions, I called my daughters to the table and set a plate in front of each. In the center of the table I placed a collection of food: some fruit, some raw vegetables, and some Oreo cookies. “Every day,”\nI explained, “God prepares for us a plate of experiences. What kind of plate do you most enjoy?”\nThe answer was easy. Sara put three cookies on her plate. Some days are like that, aren’t they? Some days are “three-cookie days.” Many are not.\nSometimes our plates have nothing but vegetables—twenty-four hours of celery, carrots, and squash. Apparently God knows we need some strength, and though the portion may be hard to swallow, isn’t it for our own good?\nMost days, however, have a bit of it all.\nThe next time your “plate” has more broccoli than apple pie, remember who prepared the meal, and eat hearty. This is a chef you can trust. ',

      "text": 'What are your favorite foods? Pizza? Ice cream? A sauerkraut sandwich? I’ll bet you don’t eat your favorite every day. We’ve all been taught the importance of a balanced diet. Balance is important in our life experiences too. God knows it, and he can help you to be thankful no matter what life puts on your plate.'
