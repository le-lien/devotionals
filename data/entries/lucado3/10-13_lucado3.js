But Jesus taught a different lesson.\n“When Jesus was raised from the dead it was a signal of the end of death-as-the-end” (Romans 6:5–6 MSG). Don’t you love that sentence? The resurrection is an exploding flare announcing to all sincere seekers that it is safe to believe. Safe to believe in ultimate justice. Safe to believe in eternal bodies. Safe to believe in heaven as our mansion and the earth as its porch.\nSafe to believe in a time when questions won’t keep us awake and pain won’t keep us down. Safe to believe in open graves and endless days and genuine praise.\nJesus died, but it wasn’t the end. Because Jesus walked out of his tomb, your death won’t be the end either. Because we can accept the resurrection story, it is safe to accept the rest of the story. ',

      "text": 'It’s the answer to every question about Christ and Christianity. Jesus died on a cross, his body was sealed in a tomb, and on the third day he threw the stone aside and walked into the sun. Who else comes back to life? We do, when we give up this life on earth and join Jesus in heaven.'
