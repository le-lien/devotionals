You may go now, but don’t sin anymore.” They are the words of Jesus to the woman caught in bed with a man not her husband (John 8:1–11 NCV). Read them.\nPonder them. Memorize them.\nOr better still, take Jesus with you to your canyon of shame. Invite Christ to journey with you, to stand beside you as you retell the events of the darkest nights of your soul. The night you lied to your parents. The night you stole at the store. The night you gave up your virginity.\nAnd then listen. Listen carefully. He’s speaking . . . “I don’t judge you guilty.”\nAnd watch. Watch carefully. He’s writing. He’s leaving a message. Not in the sand, but on a cross. Not with his hand, but with his blood. His message has two words: not guilty. ',
