    "body": 'Peter and his fellow storm riders knew they were in trouble that night on the Sea of Galilee. Their boat lurched and lunged like a kite in a March wind.\nLightning sliced the blackness with a silver sword. Winds whipped the sails, leaving the disciples “in the middle of the sea, tossed by the waves” (Matthew 14:24). Maybe you can relate?\nIn the middle of flunking a class, tossed about by feelings of failure.\nIn the middle of a fight with a friend, tossed about by guilt.\nIn the middle of a breakup, tossed about by despair.\nThe disciples fought the storm for nine cold, skin-drenching hours. Then the unspeakable happened. Someone approached, walking on the water. “‘A ghost!’ they said, crying out in terror” (Matthew 14:26 MSG).\nThey didn’t expect Jesus to come to them this way. Neither do we. We expect him to come in quiet worship songs and morning Bible studies. We never expect to see him in the middle of bitter feuds or broken relationships.\nBut it is in storms that he does his best work, for it is in storms that he has our best attention. ',

      "text": 'Funny how we do that—we expect to see Jesus at our “holy” times, but not the rest of the time. Only he’s so much bigger than that. So call on him. Look for him. Not just when you worship. Not just when you pray. Anytime. Everywhere. Absolutely when you’re in trouble. Because when you need him most, he’s right there with you, ready to calm the craziest storm.'
