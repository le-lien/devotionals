    "body": 'My dad was in the hospital, bedridden. The end was near. A little girl named Ginger made a get-well card in her Sunday school class. She and her mom delivered it in person.\nSomehow, Ginger had a moment alone with my dad and asked as only a six-year-old can, “Are you going to die?” He touched her hand and told her to come near. “Yes, I am going to die. When? I don’t know.”\nShe asked if he was afraid to go away. “Away is heaven,” he told her. “I will be with my Father. I am ready to see him eye-to-eye.” About this point in the visit, Ginger’s mother and mine returned. Ginger gave my dad a big, beautiful smile. He did the same—and winked.\nA man near death, winking at the thought of it. Years later, Ginger wrote me a note about that day. My dad had taught her something about facing trouble, about facing even death. “The worst thing that could happen,” she wrote, “is getting to see ‘my Father eye-to-eye.’” ',
