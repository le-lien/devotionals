    "body": 'All the world religions can be placed in one of two categories: legalism or grace. You are saved based on your deeds or you are saved based on the gift of Christ’s death.\nA legalist believes the supreme force behind salvation is you. If you look right, speak right, and belong to the right group, you will be saved. The responsibility doesn’t lie within God; it lies within you. The result?\nEverything looks great on the outside. The talk is good and the step is true.\nBut look closely. Listen carefully. Something is missing. What is it? Joy.\nWhat’s there? Fear. (That you won’t do enough.) Arrogance. (That you have done enough.) Failure. (That you have made a mistake.) Spiritual life is not a human effort. It’s not a test to study for or a grade to earn. You don’t achieve salvation by building up extra credit points. Your life of faith is rooted in and coordinated by the Holy Spirit. Every spiritual achievement is created and energized by God. Including salvation, the gift we call grace. ',
