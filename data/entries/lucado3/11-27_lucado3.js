Collect your blessings. Catalog his kindnesses.\nAssemble your reasons for gratitude and recite them. “Always be joyful. Pray continually, and give thanks whatever happens. That is what God wants for you in Christ Jesus” (1 Thessalonians 5:16–18 NCV).\nLook at the totality of those terms. Always be joyful. Pray continually.\nGive thanks whatever happens. Learn a lesson from Sidney Connell. When her brand-new bicycle was stolen, she called her dad with the bad news. He expected his daughter to be upset. But Sidney wasn’t crying. She was honored. “Dad,” she boasted, “out of all the bikes they could have taken, they took mine.”\nMake gratitude your default emotion, and you’ll find yourself giving thanks for even the problems of life.
