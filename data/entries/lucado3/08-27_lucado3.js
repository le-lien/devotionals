    "body": 'On a trip to the United Kingdom, our family visited a castle. In the center of its garden sat a maze. Row after row of shoulder-high hedges, leading to one dead end after another. Successfully navigate the puzzle, and discover the door to a tall tower in the center of the garden. Were you to look at our family pictures of the trip, you’d see four of our five family members standing on top of the tower. Hmmm, someone is still on the ground. Guess who? I was stuck in the foliage. I just couldn’t figure out which way to go.\nAh, but then I heard a voice from above. “Hey, Dad.” I looked up to see Sara, peering through the turret at the top. “You’re going the wrong way,” she explained. “Back up and turn right.”\nDo you think I trusted her? I didn’t have to. But do you know what I did?\nI listened. Her vantage point was better than mine. She was above the maze.\nShe could see what I couldn’t.\nDon’t you think we should do the same with God? ',

A jet pilot’s view extends hundreds of miles. But God? He sees it all in a glance—the entire universe and the single next step you need to take.'
