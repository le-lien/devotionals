    "body": 'Several hundred feet beneath my chair is a lake, an underground cavern of crystalline water known as the Edwards Aquifer. We South Texans know much about this aquifer. We know its length (175 miles). We know its layout.\nWe know the water is pure. Fresh. It irrigates farms, waters lawns, fills pools, and quenches thirst.\nBut for all the facts we do know, there is an essential one we don’t. We don’t know its size. The depth of the cavern? A mystery. Number of gallons?\nUnmeasured.\n“We estimate,” a water conservationist said. “We try to measure. But the exact quantity? No one knows.”\nBring to mind another unmeasured pool? It might. Not a pool of water but a pool of love. God’s love. Aquifer fresh. Pure as April snow. One swallow satisfies the thirsty throat and softens the crusty heart. Dunk a life in God’s love, and watch it emerge cleansed and changed. We know the impact of God’s love.\nBut the volume? No person has ever measured it. ',

      "text": 'God’s love is without limit. Think you care for your dog? God loves you more. Think you love sausage and mushroom pizza? God tops that. Think you love your friends, your parents, your brother and sister? God loves you even more than this. Face it—you can’t outlove God.'
