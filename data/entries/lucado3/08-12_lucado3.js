A clod of dirt becomes a source of inspiration and romance. The moon reflects the greater light.\nWhat would happen if we accepted our place as Son reflectors? Such a shift would probably be a big change, however. We’ve been demanding our way and stamping our feet since God made us. Aren’t we all born with a default drive set on selfishness? I want a girlfriend who makes me happy and friends who always ask my opinion. I want a wardrobe that flatters me and video games that entertain me and a family that serves me.\nHow can we be bumped off of self-center? We move from mefocus to God-focus by thinking about him. Talking about him. Following the advice of the apostle Paul: “As all of us reflect the Lord’s glory with faces that are not covered with veils, we are being changed into his image with ever-increasing glory” (2 Corinthians 3:18 GOD’S WORD). His light changes us. ',
