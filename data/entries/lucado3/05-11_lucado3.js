    "body": 'For Mary, the future mother of Jesus, it was the shock of her life. The angel Gabriel told her that she would become pregnant. The announcement stirred a torrent of questions in her heart. How would she become pregnant?\nWhat would the people think? What would her fiancé, Joseph, say? Gabriel explained some of it. But to find out for sure, Mary would have to wait.\nTo wait, biblically speaking, is not to assume the worst, worry, make demands, or take control. Nor is waiting doing nothing. It is a sustained effort to stay focused on God through prayer and belief. To wait is to “rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for Him” (Psalm 37:7).\nIt seems that’s just what Mary did. And God worked as she waited. He sent a message to Joseph. He prompted Caesar to declare a census. He led the family to Bethlehem. “God is always at work for the good of everyone who loves him” (Romans 8:28 CEV). Mary learned a lesson all of us would be wise to learn—how to mix patience with total trust in God. ',

      "text": 'Mothers know all about patience. Yours had to wait months just to see your face (today might be a good day to thank her for that). We all have to wait sometimes. So how will we do it? Stressed out and ready to scream? Or calm and confident, trusting in God? Let’s follow the example of the mother of Jesus.'
