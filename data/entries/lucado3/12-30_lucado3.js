Remember the summary of Solomon? “To everything there is a season, a time for every purpose under heaven” (Ecclesiastes 3:1).\nGod administers life the way he manages the universe: through seasons.\nWhen it comes to the earth, we understand God’s management strategy.\nNature needs winter to rest and spring to awaken. We don’t dash into underground shelters at the sight of spring’s tree buds. Earthly seasons don’t upset us. But unexpected personal ones certainly do. The move to a new city.\nThe breakup you never saw coming.\nAre you on the eve of change? Do you find yourself looking into a new chapter? Are the leaves of your world showing signs of a new season?\nHeaven’s message for you is clear: when everything else changes, God’s presence never does. He may surprise you. But he wants you to know: you’ll never face the future without his help. ',
