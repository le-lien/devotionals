    "body": 'Have you ever noticed in the western movies how the bounty hunter travels alone? It’s not hard to see why. Who wants to hang out with a guy who settles scores for a living? Who wants to risk getting on his bad side? More than once I’ve heard a person spew his anger. He thought I was listening, when really I was thinking, I hope I never get on his list. Crabby sorts, these bounty hunters. Best leave them alone. Hang out with the angry and you might catch a stray bullet. Debt-settling is a lonely occupation. It’s also an unhealthy one.\nIf you’re out to settle the score, you’ll never rest. How can you? For one thing, your enemy may never pay up. As much as you think you deserve an apology, the other person may not agree. You may never get a penny’s worth of justice. And if you do, will it be enough?\nThere is another way. Put away your guns and spurs. Forgive. It’s a lot more healthy and a lot more holy. ',

It may look cool on screen to wear a gun and track down the bad guys, but in the real world it’s a long and miserable ride. Let God do the tracking. You do the forgiving.'
