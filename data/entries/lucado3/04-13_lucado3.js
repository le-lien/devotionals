    "body": 'The scene is very simple; you’ll recognize it quickly. A grove of twisted olive trees. Ground cluttered with large rocks. A low stone fence. A dark, dark night.\nSee that solitary figure? Flat on the ground. Face stained with dirt and tears. Fists pounding the hard earth. Eyes wide with a stupor of fear. Hair matted with salty sweat. Is that blood on his forehead?\nThat’s Jesus. Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane (Luke 22:44).\nWe see an agonizing, straining, and struggling Jesus. We see a “man of sorrows.” We see a man struggling with fear, wrestling with commitments, and yearning for relief.\nSeeing God like this does wonders for our own suffering. God was never more human than at this hour. God was never nearer to us than when he hurt.\nLike us, he was looked down on and rejected. He understands the agonies we go through because he’s been through them himself. ',

      "text": 'We often tell friends we understand what they’re going through, but do we really? Unless your own dad has lost his job, can you know how a family feels when their income is suddenly cut off? Yet Jesus does understand. He’s felt every sorrow you have, and he’s walking with you in yours right now.'
