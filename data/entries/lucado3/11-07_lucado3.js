    "body": 'Want to see a miracle? Plant a word of love deep in a person’s heart and life. Nurture it with a smile and a prayer, and watch what happens.\nCompliment your friend on the way her hair looks today. Thank a buddy for his positive example. Give your teacher a note of appreciation at the end of the term. Bake cookies and take them to the single mom and her kids down the street. Help your brother with his homework. Hug your mom before you leave for school. Honor your dad by asking him about his day.\nSowing seeds of peace is like sowing beans. You don’t know why it works; you just know it does. Seeds are planted, and topsoils of hurt are shoved away. Anger fades. Conflicts decline. Peace sprouts and spreads.\nDon’t forget the principle. Never underestimate the power of a seed. ',
