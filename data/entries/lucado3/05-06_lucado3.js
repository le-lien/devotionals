To get someone’s attention is no easy task.\nHe must be willing to set everything aside to listen: turn down the music, turn away from the monitor, turn the corner of the page and set down the book. When someone is willing to silence everything else so he can hear us clearly, it is a privilege. A rare privilege, indeed.\nYet your prayers are honored in heaven in just this way. God drops whatever he’s doing to hear your thoughts. He pushes aside all obstacles to hear your message. Your words are like a highpriority text to heaven. They go directly to the very throne of God.\nYour words do more than get God’s attention. Your prayer on earth activates God’s power in heaven, and “God’s will is done on earth as it is in heaven.” Your prayers move God to change the world. You may not understand the mystery of prayer. You don’t need to. But this much is clear: Actions in heaven begin when someone prays on earth. ',
