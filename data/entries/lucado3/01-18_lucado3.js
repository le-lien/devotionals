    "body": 'God offers you a family of friends and friends who are family—his church.\nWhen you transfer your trust into Christ, he not only pardons you; he also places you in his family of friends.\nFamily far and away beats any other biblical term to describe the church.\nBrothers  or brothers and sisters appears a whopping 148 times between the book of Acts and the book of Revelation. The church isn’t a place to go but a group of people who care for each other in faith.\nGod heals his family through his family. In the church we use our gifts to love each other, honor one another, keep an eye on troublemakers, and carry each other’s burdens. As his children, we belong to the Father. It’s what he had in mind from the beginning: “God decided in advance to adopt us into his own family by bringing us to himself through Jesus Christ” (Ephesians 1:5\nNLT). ',
