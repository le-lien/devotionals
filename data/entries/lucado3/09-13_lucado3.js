    "body": 'For all its strange twists and unique characters, the Bible has a simple story.\nGod made man. Man rejected God. God won’t give up until he wins him back.\nGod will whisper. He will shout. He will touch and tug. He will take away our problems; he’ll even take away our blessings. If there are a thousand steps between us and him, he will take all but one. But he will leave the final one for us. The choice is ours. “If you declare with your mouth,\n‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved” (Romans 10:9 NIV).\nPlease understand. His goal is not to make you happy. His goal is to make you his. His goal is not to get you what you want; it is to get you what you need. ',
