    "body": 'Over a hundred years ago in England, a mine collapsed, killing many of the workers inside. A bishop was asked to comfort the mourners. Standing in front of the mine, he said, “It is very difficult for us to understand why God should let such an awful disaster happen, but we know him and we trust him, and all will be right. I have at home, an old bookmark given to me by my mother. It is worked in silk, and, when I examine the wrong side of it, I see nothing but a tangle of threads, crossed and re-crossed. It looks like a big mistake. One would think that someone had done it who did not know what she was doing. But, when I turn it over and look at the right side, I see there, beautifully embroidered, the letters GOD IS LOVE.\n“We are looking at this today,” he counseled, “from the wrong side.\nSomeday we shall see it from another standpoint and shall understand. ”13\nIndeed we will. Until then, focus less on the tangled threads and more on the hand of the weaver. ',
