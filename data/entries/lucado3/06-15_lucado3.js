He and Mom had saved their money and made their plans. They wanted to visit every national park in their travel trailer. Then came the diagnosis: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig’s disease), a cruel degenerative disease of the muscles.\nAt the time, my wife, Denalyn, and I were preparing to do mission work in Brazil. When we got the news, I offered to change my plans. After all, how could I leave the country while he was dying? Dad’s written reply was immediate. “In regards to my disease and your going to Rio. That is really an easy answer for me and that is ‘GO.’ … I have no fear of death or eternity …\nso don’t be concerned about me. Just ‘GO.’ Please him.”\nDad reminded me that when facing trouble or even death, there is still just one answer. Be brave. Please God. My father’s lesson was that doing the will of the Father always matters most. ',
