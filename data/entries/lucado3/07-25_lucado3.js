    "body": 'Iwas about eight years old when, at a neighborhood party, I met the bounce-back clown. He was pear-shaped, narrower at the top than the bottom.\nInflated and Bozo-like. As tall as I was. He didn’t make music at the touch of a button or recite lines at the pull of a string. He didn’t do anything, except this: bounce back.\nKnock him down, he popped right up. Clobber him with a bat, pop him in the nose, give him a swift kick to the side, and he would fall down, but not for long. We did our best to level the clown. One punch after the other, each more vicious than before. None of us succeeded. Only later did I learn Bozo’s secret: a three-pound counterbalance at his base.\nLife comes at us, too, with a fury of flying fists: right hook of rejection, sucker punch of loss. It’s a slugfest out there. We too need a counterbalance.\nIt turns out we have one. Not a piece of iron, but a deeply felt faith in God’s power and authority. ',

      "text": 'When you’re fighting off one punch after another, just standing up is a challenge, let alone bouncing back. But you have a secret weapon. You know who has the power, who’s in control. You know who wins in the end. So don’t be a clown. Call for God’s help, and bounce back.'
