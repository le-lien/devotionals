When they insult your shoes, not understanding that your family is short on funds? We need to be careful that we don’t do the same to others.\nAre they too loud? Perhaps they fear being neglected again. Are they too quiet? Perhaps they fear failing again. Too slow? Perhaps they fell the last time they hurried. You don’t know. Only someone who has followed yesterday’s steps can be their judge.\nNot only are we ignorant about yesterday, we are ignorant about tomorrow. Dare we judge a book while chapters are yet unwritten? Should we comment on a painting while the artist still holds the brush? How can you dismiss a soul until God’s work is complete? “God began doing a good work in you, and I am sure he will continue it until it is finished when Jesus Christ comes again” (Philippians 1:6 NCV).

They’re probably dealing with things you can’t even imagine. Let your goal be, instead of judging them, to understand them.'
