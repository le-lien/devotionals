    "body": 'Is pressure getting to you? There’s so much of it. Pressure from parents to get top grades to get scholarships to get into the best college. Pressure at your part-time job at the Snow Cone to show up earlier, serve faster, smile bigger. Pressure from the band teacher to keep those rowdy sophomore sax players in line. Pressure from one group of friends to say and wear the right thing. Pressure from another group to work less and hang out more.\nAnd then there’s the pressure you put on yourself. You want to be the best. Sure, it’s tough keeping everyone happy. But it’s all part of the plan. You just need to be perfect. That’s what God expects, right?\nActually, God has a better idea: “For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God” (Ephesians 2:8). We contribute nothing. Nada. As opposed to the merit badge of the Scout, salvation of the soul is unearned. A gift. Our merits merit nothing.\nGod’s work merits everything. ',

      "text": 'There’s a problem with pushing for perfection—we’ll never get there. Good? Maybe. Stressed? For sure. But perfect? That’s God’s turf. Salvation is one thing we don’t do. Just confess your sins and believe. It’s God’s perfect plan.'
