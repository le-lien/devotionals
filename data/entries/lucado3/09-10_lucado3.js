We need to hear that life’s mistakes, mishaps, and tragedies are not reasons to bail out. They are simply reasons to sit tight.\nCorrie ten Boom used to say, “When the train goes through a tunnel and the world gets dark, do you jump out? Of course not. You sit still and trust the engineer to get you through.”\nYes, you will say the wrong thing, write down the wrong answer, and pick the wrong friend. You will have days—and weeks—that feel like the end of the world, and you will be discouraged.\nThe way to deal with discouragement? The cure for disappointment? Go back and read the story of God. Read it again and again. Be reminded that you aren’t the first person to cry. And you aren’t the first person to be helped.\nRead the story, and remember—the story is yours! ',
