And the people in them tend to treat everyone else like they have a disease.\nMaybe you’re in a clique now. Or maybe there’s a group you’re dying to join. But are cliques all they’re cracked up to be? What good is a group that makes others feel left out?\nGod shows us another approach. He has a white-hot passion to save the children of every jungle, neighborhood, village, and slum. His vision for the end of history includes “people for God from every tribe, language, people, and nation” (Revelation 5:9 NCV). He loves the gypsies of Turkey, the hippies of California, the cowboys and rednecks of West Texas. He has a heart for science club presidents and football team captains.\nChrist has little use for cliques. He opens his arms to all. ',
