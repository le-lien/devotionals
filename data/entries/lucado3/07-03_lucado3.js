    "body": 'Remember Joseph and Mrs. Potiphar? When Joseph refused her advances, the master’s wife made up a story and had Joseph thrown into prison. The warden put Joseph in charge of his cellmates. Joseph could have sat in a corner and mumbled, “I’ve learned my lesson. I’m not running anything for anybody.” But he didn’t complain, didn’t criticize. He displayed a willing spirit with the prisoners. He even interpreted their dreams. Little things, really. But God took notice.\nGod is watching how you handle the little things too. If you are faithful over a few matters, he will set you over many (Matthew 25:21). God allowed Joseph to rise to a powerful position, where his wisdom saved the lives of thousands. The reward of good work is greater work.\nDo you aspire to great things? Excel in the small things. Show up on time. Finish your work early. Don’t complain. Let others grumble in the corner of the prison cell. Not you. You know how God shapes his servants.\nToday’s prisoner may become tomorrow’s prime minister. When you are given a task, take it. ',

      "text": 'Great artists and composers are remembered for their sweeping, stunning works. Michelangelo and the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Beethoven and his Fifth Symphony. Yet each masterpiece was created through the repeated excellence of a single brushstroke and a single note. Greatness is found in the little things.'
