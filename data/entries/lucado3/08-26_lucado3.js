    "body": 'When I was seven years old, I ran away from home. I’d had enough of my father’s rules and decided I could make it on my own, thank you very much. With my clothes in a paper bag, I stormed out the back gate and marched down the alley. But I didn’t go far. I got to the end of the alley and remembered I was hungry, so I went back home. My dad welcomed me back.\nThough the rebellion was brief, it was rebellion nonetheless. And had you stopped me, I might have told you how I felt. I might have said, “I don’t need a father. I’m too big for the rules of my family.”\nI didn’t hear the rooster crow like Peter did after he lied about knowing Jesus. But I learned from my father on earth what Peter learned from his Father in heaven. Our God is no fair-weather Father. He’s not into this love-’em-and-leave-’em stuff. I can count on him to welcome me back no matter how far I go from him. You can too. ',
