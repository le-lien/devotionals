    "body": 'Over a hundred years ago, a group of fishermen were relaxing in a Scottish seaside inn. One of the men gestured widely, and his arm struck the serving maid’s tea tray, sending the teapot flying into the whitewashed wall.\nThe innkeeper looked at the damage and sighed, “The whole wall will have to be repainted.”\n“Perhaps not,” offered a stranger. “Let me work with it.”\nHaving nothing to lose, the innkeeper agreed. The man pulled pencils, brushes, and pigment out of an art box and went to work. In time, an image began to emerge: a stag with a great rack of antlers. The man inscribed his signature at the bottom, paid for his meal, and left. His name: Sir Edwin Landseer, famous painter of wildlife.\nIn Sir Edwin’s hands, a mistake became a masterpiece. God’s hands do the same, over and over. To show his love, he draws together the disjointed blotches in our life and turns them into a beautiful work of art. ',
