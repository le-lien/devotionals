    "body": 'Leo Tolstoy, the great Russian writer, tells of the time he was walking down the street and passed a beggar. Tolstoy reached into his pocket to give the beggar some money, but his pocket was empty. Tolstoy turned to the man and said, “I’m sorry, my brother, but I have nothing to give.” The beggar brightened and said, “You have given me more than I asked for—you have called me brother.”\nYou may think you have nothing to offer those in need around you, but it’s not true. For the discouraged and downhearted, the littlest thing—a smile or encouraging word—may be enough to lift their spirits. To the loved, a kind word is a crumb, but to the love-starved, a word of kindness can be a feast.\nLook at the brothers and sisters around you. They may be hiding it, but I guarantee that some are hurting and hungry for the kindness only you can give. ',
