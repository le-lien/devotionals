    "body": 'When Paul said, “Love always protects,” he might have been thinking of a coat. One scholar believes he was.\nThe Theological Dictionary of the New Testament is known for its word study, not its poetry. But the scholar sounds poetic as he explains the meaning of protect as used in 1 Corinthians 13:7. The word conveys, he says, “the idea of covering with a cloak of love.”\nRemember receiving one? You were nervous about the test, but the teacher stayed late to help you. You were far from home and afraid, but your mother phoned to comfort you. You were innocent and accused, so your friend stood to defend you. Covered with encouragement. Covered with tender-hearted care. Covered with protection. Covered with a cloak of love.\nThis is how Christ covered you and me when he died on the cross. And this is how we need to cover the world. ',

      "text": 'When you were a child, did you ever shiver so much that your mom or dad wrapped a coat around you? That simple act is a symbol of love that protects. There are a thousand ways to show such love, but each says, “I care for you, and I am watching over you.”'
