    "body": 'Acouple of days ago, Denalyn and I had a disagreement. We had agreed to sell our house, but we couldn’t agree on a realtor. Back and forth we went.\nA pleasant day turned sour. The time came for me to preach at morning worship services. I gave Denalyn a quick goodbye. “We’ll deal with this later,” I said.\nBut God wanted to deal with me immediately. The drive to church is only five minutes, but that’s all it took for God to prick my conscience. It was a test. Would I pout or apologize? Would I ignore the tension or take care of it?\nBefore the service began, I called Denalyn, apologized for my stubbornness, and asked for her forgiveness. Later that night, we reached a decision on a realtor, had a prayer, and put the matter to rest.\nIf you see your troubles as nothing more than hassles and hurts, you’ll be bitter and mad. Yet if you see your troubles as tests, used by God for his glory and your growth, you’ll pass with flying colors. ',
