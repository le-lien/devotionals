If the majority had ruled, David never would have fought Goliath.\nHis brothers would have voted for him to stay with the sheep. What’s the point? Instead of listening to the majority, you must listen to your own heart and do what you know is right.\nGod says you’re on your way to becoming a disciple when you can do right and keep a pure heart. “Who may stand in his holy place? The one who has clean hands and a pure heart” (Psalm 24:3–4 NIV).\nDo you ever wonder if everything will turn out right as long as you do everything right? Do you ever try to do something right and yet nothing seems to turn out like you planned? Take heart. When people do what is right no matter what the majority says—God remembers. ',
