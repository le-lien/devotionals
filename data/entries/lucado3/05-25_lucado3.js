You haven’t. “God’s gifts and God’s call are under full warranty—never canceled, never rescinded” (Romans 11:29 MSG).\nHere’s how it works. Your boyfriend dumps you. All those promises about taking you to the prom melted the moment he met the new girl on the track team. Now you feel flatter than trash under a steamroller. The jerk. The bum. The no-good pond scum. You’re tempted to get even. But wait! You have a warranty. God is calling you to a different life. And so you choose to ponder your destiny. “I am God’s child. My life is more than this life … more than this broken heart. This is God’s promise and, unlike that sorry excuse for a guy, God won’t break a promise.”\nBingo. You just redefined your life according to God’s dictionary. You just trusted your destiny. ',
