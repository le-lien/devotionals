    "body": 'Confess. Admit. Come clean. Fess up. The words all mean the same thing—\nbut what is that exactly?\nConfession isn’t telling God what he doesn’t know. Impossible.\nConfession isn’t complaining. If I just repeat my problems and woes, I’m whining. Confession isn’t blaming. Pointing fingers at others without pointing any at me feels good, but it doesn’t bring healing.\nConfession is so much more. Confession is a radical reliance on grace. A declaration of our trust in God’s goodness. If our understanding of grace is small, our confession will be small: reluctant, hesitant, incomplete, buried in excuses and qualifications. You know the kind. “Hey, Sis, sorry that I read your diary, but you really shouldn’t have left it open on your bed.”\nWild, overflowing grace, on the other hand, creates a full and honest confession. Like the one of the son who took his inheritance money, left home, blew it all, and returned in shame to say, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son” (Luke 15:21 ESV). ',

Sure, it’s hard, but trust him. His life-changing forgiveness is right around the corner. JULY “Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.” [ John 14:27 ]'
