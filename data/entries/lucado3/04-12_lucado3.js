    "body": 'In many houses discouragement is the language everyone speaks. The home is a war zone, and the warriors have nicknames like Stupid, Idiot, Dummy, and Little Pain in the Neck. Bullets and shrapnel litter their lives.\nIn other homes, families follow the spirit of the Western tune “Home on the Range.” There, a discouraging word is seldom heard. People hide their hurts with smiles on their faces. Maybe the reason discouragement is seldom heard is because words are seldom heard. Silence is deadly.\nOther homes flourish with encouragement. Everyone believes in one another, supports one another, builds up, refreshes. Pats on the back. Notes in the lunch boxes. Love letters under the pillows. Hearts expressed. Prayers.\nWhich home would you rather live in?\nYou can be the first person to allow the sweet-smelling flowers of love to bloom in your house. It starts with returning a cranky comment with a few encouraging words. ',
