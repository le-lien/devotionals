    "body": 'Joseph’s life went downhill in a hurry. “Put down” by his siblings. “Thrown down” into an empty well. “Let down” by his brothers and “sold down” the river as a slave. “Led down” the road to Egypt. Down, down, down. Stripped of name, status, position. Everything he had, everything he thought he’d ever have, gone. Just like that.\nJust like you? Are you down to your final friend, down to your last dime, down on your luck, down on your life … down … down to Egypt?\nJoseph arrived in Egypt with nothing. No big name to stand on. No family to lean on. He lost everything, with one exception. His destiny. He’d had dreams that convinced him God had plans for him. The details were vague, for sure. But Joseph never lost his belief in God’s belief in him. While wearing the heavy chains of the slave owners, he remembered, “I’ve been called to more than this.” God had a destiny for Joseph, and the boy believed in it.\nDo you believe in God’s destiny for you?

      "text": 'Could Joseph have risen out of slavery to a position of leadership and power if he’d lost his faith in God and his plans? I doubt it. Take a second look at your dreams for your future. Despite your troubles today, your dreams are still possible. Even if you’re down to nothing except your destiny.'
