    "body": 'God loves you with an unfailing love.\nEngland saw a glimpse of such love in 1878. The young son of Princess Alice was infected with a horrible disease known as black diphtheria.\nDoctors quarantined the boy and told the mother to stay away. But she couldn’t. One day she overheard him whisper to the nurse, “Why doesn’t my mother kiss me anymore?” The words melted her heart. She ran to her son and smothered him with kisses. Within a few days, she was buried.1\nWhat would drive a mother to do such a thing? What would lead God to do something greater? Love. And, oh, what a love this is—“too wonderful to be measured” (Ephesians 3:19 CEV). I urge you to trust it. You may be hungry for such love. Those who should have loved you didn’t. Those who could have loved you wouldn’t. You were left at the hospital. Left off the party list. Left with a broken heart. Left with your question, “Does anybody love me?”\nPlease listen to heaven’s answer. As you ponder him on the cross, hear God assure you, “I do.” ',
