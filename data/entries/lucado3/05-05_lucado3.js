Not that he refused to defend himself when blamed for every sin of every jerk and Jezebel since Adam. Not even that after three days in a dark hole he stepped into the Easter sunrise with a smile and a swagger and a question for lowly Lucifer—“Is that your best punch?”\nThat was cool, incredibly cool.\nBut want to know the coolest thing about the One who gave up the crown of heaven for a crown of thorns? Here’s a hint: he loves you as his own. “See what great love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God!” (1 John 3:1 NIV).\nThe coolest thing? He did it for you. Just for you. ',

      "text": 'We tend to think that Christ died for “humanity,” for the millions who have put their trust in him, for the unknowable masses. That statement is true—but it misses the personal. Jesus knows and loves your individual heart. He didn’t give his life just for a crowd. He gave it specifically for you.'
