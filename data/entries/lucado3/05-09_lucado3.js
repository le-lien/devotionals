    "body": 'God will give you an uncommon life if you surrender your common one.\n“If you try to hang on to your life, you will lose it. But if you give up your life for my sake, you will save it” (Matthew 16:25 NLT).\nJesus did. He “made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness… . He humbled himself by becoming obedient to death” (Philippians 2:7–8 NIV).\nNo one in Nazareth saluted him as the Son of God. He did not stand out in his elementary-classroom photograph, demanded no glossy page in his high school yearbook. Friends knew him as a woodworker, not star hanger. His looks turned no heads; his position earned him no credit. “He gave up his place with God and made himself nothing.”\nGod hunts for those who will do likewise. These are the people he uses to bring Christ to the world. ',
