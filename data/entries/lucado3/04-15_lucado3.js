    "body": 'It makes you mad when life isn’t fair. When someone cuts in line. When the coach favors one player over another. When the cheater gets an A and you don’t.\nCome to think of it, it wasn’t fair when spikes pierced the hands that formed the earth. And it wasn’t fair that the Son of God was forced to hear the silence of God. It wasn’t fair, but it happened.\nWhile Jesus was on the cross, God sat on his hands. He turned his back.\nHe ignored the screams of the innocent. He sat in silence while the sins of the world were placed upon his Son. And he did nothing while a cry echoed in the black sky: “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”\nWas it right? No. Was it fair? No. Was it love? Yes. Life may be unfair, but God’s love for us overwhelms the most unfair thing we can think of. Jesus knows unfair. He conquers it with love. ',
