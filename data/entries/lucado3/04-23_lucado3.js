    "body": 'The church of Jesus Christ began with a group of frightened men in a second-floor room in Jerusalem.\nThey’d marched with Jesus for three years. But now that he was crucified, they gathered quietly, afraid of being found out as followers of Christ. They were timid soldiers, reluctant warriors, speechless messengers.\nDaring to dream that the master had left them some word, some plan, some direction, they came back. But little did they know their wildest dream wasn’t wild enough. Just as someone mumbles, “It’s no use,” they hear a noise. They hear a voice: “Peace be with you.”\nThe one betrayed sought his betrayers. What did he say to them? Not\n“What a bunch of flops!” Not “I told you so.” No “Where-were-you-when-I-needed-you?” speeches. But simply one phrase, “Peace be with you.” The very thing they didn’t have was the very thing he offered: peace.\nHe offers the same to us. ',
