    "body": 'Moses and the Israelites once battled the Amelekites. The military strategy of Moses was a strange one. He sent Joshua to lead the fight in the valley below. Moses ascended the mountain to pray. But he did not go alone. He took his two lieutenants, Aaron and Hur.\nWhile Joshua led physical combat, Moses engaged in a spiritual one.\nAaron and Hur stood on either side of their leader to hold up his arms in the battle of prayer. The Israelites prevailed because Moses prayed. Moses prevailed because he had a community to pray with him.\nWhat battle are you facing today? Depression? Worry? A fight with a brother or sister? On this day when we honor those who fought for our country and freedom, don’t go to war alone. Tell Christian family and friends about it so they can “hold up your arms,” praying for you and with you. And tell God. When he’s fighting on your side, you’re sure to prevail. ',
