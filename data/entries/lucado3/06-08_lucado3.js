When the most exciting thing around is watching the clock tick off another minute.\nWant a cure for the boredom blues? Do an outrageous deed. A caring act beyond reimbursement. Kindness without compensation. Do a deed for which you cannot be repaid. I’m talking about cleaning up an elderly neighbor’s yard when she’s not home. Washing your dad’s car when he’s out of town.\nInviting the guy with no friends over to play video games. Inviting the new girl to your church youth group. Bringing cookies to a shut-in or a homeless person.\nJesus said, “Help and give without expecting a return. You’ll never—I promise—regret it” (Luke 6:36 MSG). When you see the joy that results from your gift of love and time, it will blow away your boredom and replace it with breathtaking. ',

      "text": 'Funny thing about being bored—the focus is all on you and how you feel. When you dare to do a kind deed for someone, it shifts your attention. You start noticing what’s going on around you instead of what’s inside you. That’s not boring. That’s exciting.'
