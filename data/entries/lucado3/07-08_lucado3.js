    "body": 'When Jesus lands on the shore of Bethsaida, he leaves the Sea of Galilee and steps into a sea of humanity (Mark 6:34). Keep in mind, he has crossed the sea to get away from the crowds. He longs to relax with his followers. He needs anything but another crowd of thousands to teach and heal. But his love for people overcomes his need for rest.\nWe often procrastinate, putting off homework or chores. We also postpone serving others. Yet the Bible tells us, “Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your power to act” (Proverbs 3:27 NIV).\nHave you followed up with the gal you prayed with last week? Have you visited the grandfather you promised last month to see?\nCan you imagine Jesus telling the crowd, “Come back tomorrow, I’ll heal you then”? He saw the need and met it that moment. That’s a wise approach for me and you as well. ',

      "text": 'When we put things off, it usually ends up creating stress and hurt for not only ourselves but also the people around us. That’s true for tasks and appointments. It also applies to relationships. When the Holy Spirit nudges you to encourage or help someone, don’t wait. Deal with it in the moment, just as Jesus did.'
