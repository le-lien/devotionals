Hypocrite. Ever broken a promise you’ve made to God? Ever misused his name?\nDon’t you deserve to be punished? And yet, here you are. Reading this book. Breathing. Still witnessing sunsets and hearing babies gurgle. Still watching the seasons change. There are no lashes on your back or hooks in your nose or shackles on your feet. Apparently God hasn’t kept a list of your wrongs.\nListen. You have not been sprinkled with forgiveness. You have not been spattered with grace. You have not been dusted with kindness. You have been soaked in it. “The LORD is compassionate and merciful, slow to get angry and filled with unfailing love” (Psalm 103:8 NLT).\nYou are submerged in mercy. You are a minnow in the ocean of his mercy. Let it change you! ',
