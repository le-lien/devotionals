    "body": 'In 1952, Florence Chadwick attempted to swim the chilly ocean waters between Catalina Island and the California shore. She swam through foggy weather and choppy seas for fifteen hours. Her muscles began to cramp, and her resolve weakened. She begged to be taken out of the water, so aides lifted her into a boat. They paddled a few more minutes, the mist broke, and Florence discovered that the shore was less than a half mile away. “All I could see was the fog,” she later explained. “I think if I could have seen the shore, I would have made it.” 5\nTake a long look at the shore that awaits you. Don’t be fooled by the fog.\nThe finish may be only strokes away. God may be, at this moment, lifting his hand to conduct a victory song. Angels may be assembling, saints gathering, demons trembling. Stay at it! Stay in the water. Stay in the race. Stay in the fight. Forgive, one more time. Be generous, one more time. Study for one more test, encourage one more friend, swim one more stroke. ',
