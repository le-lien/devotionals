    "body": 'When grace happens, Christ enters. No other religion or philosophy makes such a claim. No other movement implies the living presence of its founder in his followers. Mohammed does not indwell Muslims. Buddha does not inhabit Hindus. Lady Gaga does not reside in even her most fervent fans.\nInfluence? Instruct? Entice? Maybe. But occupy? No.\nYet Christians embrace this puzzling promise. “The mystery in a nutshell is just this: Christ is in you” (Colossians 1:27 MSG). The Christian is a person in whom Christ is happening. He moves in, making himself at home. We sense his rearranging. Confusion turns into clear direction. Bad choices are replaced by better ones. Little by little a new self emerges. “He decided from the outset to shape the lives of those who love him along the same lines as the life of his Son” (Romans 8:29 MSG).\nGrace is God as heart surgeon—cracking open your chest, removing your heart, poisoned as it is with pride and pain, and replacing it with his own. His dream isn’t just to get you into heaven, but to get heaven into you. ',
