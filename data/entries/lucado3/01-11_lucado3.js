    "body": 'Faith is not the belief that God will do what you want. Faith is the belief that God will do what is right. “People may make plans in their minds, but the LORD decides what they will do” (Proverbs 16:9 NCV). God is always near and always available. Just waiting for your touch. So let him know.\nDemonstrate your devotion:\nWrite an encouraging letter. Ask forgiveness. Be baptized. Feed a hungry person. Invite a classmate who needs a friend to church. Tell someone about Jesus.\nPray.\nWorship.\nGo.\nDo something that demonstrates faith. For faith with no effort is no faith at all. God will respond. He has never rejected a genuine act of faith. Never. ',
