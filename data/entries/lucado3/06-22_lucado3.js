You think we are brutal to each other now, imagine the world without the Holy Spirit. You think there is loneliness and despair and guilt now, imagine life without the touch of Jesus.\nWhat would your family and friends be like without him shaping their character? What would you be like? No forgiveness. No hope. No acts of kindness. No words of love. No more food given in his name. No more songs sung to his praise. No more deeds done in his honor. If God took away his angels, his grace, his promise of eternity, and his servants, what would the world be like?\nIn a word, hell.\nLet’s thank God now and every day that he is here with us. ',
