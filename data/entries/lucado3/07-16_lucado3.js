    "body": 'Satan never shuts up. The apostle John called him the accuser: “For the Accuser of our brothers and sisters has been thrown down to earth—the one who accuses them before our God day and night” (Revelation 12:10\nNLT). He gets people to peddle his poison. Friends dredge up your past:\n“Remember that time you cheated on the test?” Preachers proclaim all guilt and no grace: “You don’t measure up to God’s standards.” Your parents own a travel agency that specializes in guilt trips: “Why can’t you grow up?”\n“Would it kill you to work a little harder?” “You could be so pretty. When are you going to lose a little weight?”\nJesus overcomes the devil’s guilt with grace. You are who your Creator says you are: Spiritually alive. Connected to God. Awake to your potential. An honored child.\nRemember, when God looks at you, he sees Jesus first. It boils down to this choice: Do you trust your Advocate or your accuser? ',
