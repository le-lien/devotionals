    "body": 'The Word became flesh,” John said. In other words … he was touchable, approachable, reachable. And, what’s more, he was ordinary. If he were here today, you probably wouldn’t notice him as he walked through a shopping mall. He wouldn’t turn heads by the clothes he wore or the jewelry he flashed.\n“Just call me Jesus,” you can almost hear him say.\nHe was the kind of fellow you’d invite to watch the Cubs-Giants game at your house. He’d wrestle on the floor with your little brother, doze on your couch, and cook steaks on your grill. He’d laugh at your jokes and tell a few of his own. And when you spoke, he’d listen to you as if he had all the time in eternity.\nAnd one thing’s for sure, you’d invite him back. Because there would be something about him. A peace. A power. A presence. Something you need. ',

      "text": 'It happened two thousand years ago, but the concept is still incredible today. God in the flesh. From heaven to human. He loved us so much that he gave up everything to be one of us. When someone does all that, isn’t he worth getting to know a little bit better?'
