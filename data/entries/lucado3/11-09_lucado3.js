    "body": 'Observant guy, Paul. He noticed something about the way we treat people.\nHe said it about marriage, but the principle applies in any relationship.\n“The man who loves his wife loves him-self” (Ephesians 5:28 NCV). There’s a connection between the way you feel about yourself and the way you feel about others. If you are at peace with yourself—if you like yourself—you will get along with others.\nThe opposite is also true. If you don’t like yourself, if you are ashamed, embarrassed, or angry, other people are going to know it.\nWhy is this important? Because Jesus told us the two greatest commandments are “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind” (Matthew 22:37 ESV) and “Love your neighbor as yourself” (v. 39 ESV). So give yourself a break! You are incredibly valuable, a creation of God, commanded to love. Our assignment is to love fully, with heart, soul, and mind—and that includes loving ourselves. ',
