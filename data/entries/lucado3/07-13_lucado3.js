Dancing for twenty-four hours straight?\nWhen it comes to our relationship with God, we have attempted to reach the moon but barely made it off the ground. We tried to swim the Atlantic, but couldn’t get beyond the reef. We’ve attempted to scale the Everest of salvation, but we have yet to leave the base camp, much less make it up the slope. The quest is simply too great. We don’t need more supplies or muscle or technique; we need a helicopter.\nCan’t you hear it hovering?\n“God has a way to make people right with him” (Romans 3:21 NCV). We need to understand this truth. God’s highest dream is not to make us rich, not to make us successful or popular or famous. God’s dream is to make us right with him. ',
