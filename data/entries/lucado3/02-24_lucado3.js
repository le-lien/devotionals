    "body": 'Your father is a doctor. Your grandfather is a doctor. Everyone expects you to be a doctor. But you want to study music. Did you miss something?\nNo, I think you found something. People often say you can be anything you want if you work hard enough. A butcher. A sales rep. An ambassador.\nBut can you? If God didn’t pack within you the meat sense of a butcher, the people skills of a salesperson, or the world vision of an ambassador, can you be one? An unhappy, dissatisfied one perhaps. But a fulfilled one? Can an acorn become a rose, a whale fly like a bird, or lead become gold? No way.\nYou can’t be anything you want to be. But you can be everything God wants you to be.\nGod doesn’t crank people out on an assembly line. You were uniquely crafted and carved. “I make all things new,” he declares (Revelation 21:5). He didn’t hand you your granddad’s bag or your aunt’s life; he personally and deliberately packed you. Live out of the bag God gave you. Enjoy making music. ',
