    "body": 'Barabbas had been thrown into jail for rebellion and murder, but the Roman governor declared he would let one prisoner go free. When the crowd clamored for Jesus to be executed, Barabbas became the pardoned prisoner.\nWe’re not told how Barabbas responded to the gift of freedom. Maybe he scorned it out of pride or refused it out of shame. We don’t know. But you can determine what to do with yours. Personalize it.\nAs long as the cross is God’s gift to the world, it will touch you but not change you. Satisfying as it is to shout, “Christ died for the world!” even sweeter it is to whisper, “Christ died for me.” “He took my place on the cross.” “He carried my sins, my cold and cruel heart.” “Through the cross he claimed, cleansed, and called me.” “He felt my shame and spoke my name.”\nThank God for the day grace happened to you. Thank Jesus for giving his life for yours—the best trade you’ll ever make. ',

      "text": 'You make trades all the time. With your friends, one pair of earrings for another. With the store clerk, your fifty dollars for his video game. Few of these trades will change you. None will mean more than the one Jesus offers —his life on earth for your life in heaven. It’s the one deal you don’t want to miss.'
