A clear map to your future.\nYou pray and wait. No answer. You pray and wait some more.\nMay I ask a very important question? What if God says no? What if the request is delayed or even denied? When God says no to you, how will you respond? If God says, “I’ve given you my grace, and that is enough,” will you be content?\nContent. That’s the word. A state of heart in which you are at peace even if God gives you nothing more than he already has. He has his reasons for saying no. Our job is “being content in any and every situation” (Philippians 4:12 NIV). God’s grace is always enough. ',

Too bad we’re too small to see the elephant with the big feet headed our way. God is bigger than the ant or the elephant. He sees what’s coming. And if he says no, it’s better to leave the crumb behind.'
