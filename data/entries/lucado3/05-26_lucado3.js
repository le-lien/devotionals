    "body": 'At a banquet, a wounded soldier was presented with the gift of a free house.\nHe nearly fell over with gratitude. He bounded on to the stage with his one good leg and threw both arms around the presenter. “Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!” He hugged the guitar player in the band and the big woman on the front row. He thanked the waiter, the other soldiers, and then the presenter again. Before the night was over, he thanked me! And I didn’t do anything.\nShouldn’t we be equally grateful? Jesus is building a house for us (John 14:2). Our deed of ownership is every bit as certain as that of the soldier.\nAnd God gives us so much more. A zillion diamonds sparkle in the sky every night. Thank you, God. A miracle of muscles enables eyes to read these words and your brain to process them. Thank you, God. Brave men and women, like the wounded soldier, fight for our freedoms. Thank you, Lord.\nThe grateful heart is like a magnet, sweeping over the day, collecting reasons for gratitude. ',

      "text": 'We take so much for granted. The roof over your head and the pillow under it. Food to share and friends who care. We should always thank God for these things. Even if we’re having a bad week, we know how the story ends. We should be grateful for a room reserved in heaven.'
