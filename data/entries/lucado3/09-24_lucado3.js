    "body": 'Any athlete will agree that a water bottle is a must. Deprive your body of necessary fluid, and your body will tell you. Dry mouth. Swollen tongue.\nDizziness and fatigue.\nSpiritual water is also a must. Deprive your soul of it, and your soul will tell you. Dehydrated hearts send desperate messages. Snarling tempers.\nWaves of worry. Growling mastodons of guilt and fear. You think God wants you to live with these? Hopelessness. Sleeplessness. Loneliness. Resentment.\nIrritability. Insecurity. These are warnings. Symptoms of a dryness deep within.\nTreat your soul as you treat your thirst. Take a gulp. Guzzle moisture.\nFlood your heart with a good swallow of water.\nWhere do you find water for the soul? In Christ. “Let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink. If anyone believes in me, rivers of living water will flow out from that person’s heart, as the Scripture says” (John 7:37–38\nNCV). ',
