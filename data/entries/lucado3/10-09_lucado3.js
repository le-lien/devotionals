You worry that:\nYour classmates won’t appreciate you.\nYour teachers will overwork you.\nYour parents won’t understand you.\nYour friends will outshine you.\nWith time, your agenda becomes more important than God’s. You’re more concerned with making yourself look good than with making him happy. You may even find yourself doubting God’s judgment.\nGod has gifted you with talents. He has done the same to your friends. If you concern yourself with your friends’ talents, you will neglect yours. But if you concern yourself with simply doing the best you can with yours, you could inspire both you and your friends to let God be in control. He is anyway, you know.\nTry it—and don’t worry about it. ',
