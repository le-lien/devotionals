    "body": 'Y ou are God’s child. He saw you, picked you, and placed you. “You did not choose Me, but I chose you” (John 15:16). Before you are a butcher, baker, or computer maker; male, female, Asian, or black, you are God’s child.\nReplacement or fill-in? Hardly. You are his first choice.\nSuch isn’t always the case in life. A groom once leaned over to me, just minutes before I officiated his wedding, and said, “You weren’t my first choice.” “I wasn’t?” “No, the preacher I wanted couldn’t make it.” “Oh.”\n“But thanks for filling in.” “Sure, anytime.” I considered signing the marriage license: “Substitute.”\nYou’ll never hear such words from God. He chose you. He selected you because he wanted to. He walked onto the auction block where you stood and proclaimed, “This child is mine.” And he bought you with the “precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot” (1 Peter 1:19).\nRemember it. You are God’s first choice, now and forever. ',
