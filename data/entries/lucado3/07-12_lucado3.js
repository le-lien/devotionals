That’s why we need a savior.\nTrying to make it to heaven on our own goodness is like trying to get to the moon on a moonbeam; nice idea, but try it and see what happens.\nListen. Quit trying to take care of your own guilt. You can’t do it. There’s no way. Not with drugs or drama or great grades or perfect church attendance.\nSorry. I don’t care how bad you are. You can’t be bad enough to forget it. And I don’t care how good you are. You can’t be good enough to overcome it.\nYou need the One who came to earth specifically for you. You need the only One who can wash away every mistake with a holy bath. You need a Savior. ',
