Whether it’s a card in the mail requesting we come to a birthday party or a personal offer to go to the dance, an invitation is a moment to celebrate.\nOur God is an inviting God. He invited Mary to birth his Son, the disciples to fish for men, the woman who committed adultery to start over, and Thomas to touch his wounds. God is the King who prepares the palace, sets the table, and invites his subjects to come in. In fact, it seems his favorite word is come.\n“Come, let us talk about these things. Though your sins are like scarlet, they can be as white as snow.” “All you who are thirsty, come and drink.”\n“Come to me all, all of you who are tired and have heavy loads, and I will give you rest.”\nGod is a God who invites. He’s asking you, right now, to talk with him so you can both get to know each other better. What do you say? ',

He asks you to grow more and more like Christ. He asks you to spend forever with him. Each invitation is incredible. Won’t you say yes?'
