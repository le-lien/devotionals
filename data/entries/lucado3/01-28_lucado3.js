Jesus, too, was a champion of tolerance:\nTolerant of the disciples when they doubted.\nTolerant of the crowds when they misunderstood.\nTolerant of us when we blow it.\nBut there is one area where Jesus was intolerant. There was one area where he would not bend or compromise.\nAs far as he was concerned, when it comes to salvation, there aren’t several roads … there is only one road. There aren’t several paths … there is only one path. And that path is Jesus himself.\nThat is why it is so hard for people to believe in Jesus. It’s much easier to consider him one of several options rather than the option. But such a philosophy is no option. ',
