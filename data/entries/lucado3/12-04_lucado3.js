    "body": 'In 1900 the average person living in the United States wanted seventy-two different things and considered eighteen of them essential. Today the average person wants five hundred things and considers one hundred of them essential.\nOur obsession with stuff carries a hefty price tag. Eighty percent of people battle the pressure of overdue bills. We spend 110 percent of our available money trying to manage debt. And you know that some of your friends—maybe you too—can’t wait to get their hands on the latest album release, iPhone upgrade, and brand-name shoes.\nWho can keep up? We no longer measure ourselves against the Joneses next door but against the star on the screen or the hunk on the magazine cover. Hollywood’s diamond-studded earrings make yours look like gumball-machine toys. If we always think we need more, will we ever have enough?\nNo. For that reason Jesus warns, “Be on your guard against every form of greed” (Luke 12:15 NASB). ',
