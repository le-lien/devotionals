The hungry need a food drive. Stressed-out students need hope. God has work to do. And he uses our hands to do it.\nWhat the hand is to the glove, the Spirit is to the Christian. God gets into us. At times, we barely notice. Other times, we can’t miss it. God gets his fingers into our lives, inch by inch reclaiming the territory that is rightfully his.\nYour tongue? He claims it for his message. Your feet? He summons them for his purpose. Your mind? He made it and intends to use it for his glory.\nYour eyes, face, and hands? Through them he will weep, smile, and touch. He has work to do. Give God your hands (and the rest of you) and watch them change lives. ',
