    "body": 'If we are already forgiven, then why does Jesus teach us to pray, “Forgive us our debts” (Matthew 6:12)?\nThe very reason your parents want you to do the same. If I tell one of my daughters to be home by a certain time and she disobeys by intentionally staying out late, I don’t disown her. I don’t kick her out of the house or tell her to change her last name. But I do expect her to be honest and apologize.\nAnd until she does, the tenderness of our relationship will suffer. The nature of the relationship won’t change. I’ll still be Dad, and she’ll still be my daughter. But the intimacy between us will be blocked.\nThe same happens in our spiritual life. Confession does not create a relationship with God; it simply nourishes it. If you are a believer, owning up to your mistakes does not change your position before God, but it does increase your peace with God. ',
