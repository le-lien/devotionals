And sometimes you’re going to pray about things, and the prayer isn’t going to be answered the way you want.\nBut Jesus predicted the bad stuff. He said, “In this world you will have trouble” (John 16:33 NIV). It’s as if he were telling us, “Don’t freak out when things get extreme.” If he can predict the problem, he can solve it.\nSomewhere between the naïve optimists and the doom-and-gloomers are the sober, honest disciples of Christ who don’t panic or lose faith at the presence of problems. They know that all these problems are a natural unfolding of events, part of the plan God laid out long ago.\nOur mission is to trust and endure. We’re headed for the embrace of heaven, where nothing bad will ever happen again. ',
