How can you know?\nThe Bible says, “If you confess with your mouth, ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved”\n(Romans 10:9 HCSB). First, confess that Jesus is Lord. Say it out loud or quietly in your heart—either way. Just mean it. Then believe that Jesus was resurrected. He’s not a man in the grave but God in the flesh with the power over death.\nCatch what Romans 10:9 does not say—live perfectly, be nice to everyone, don’t mess up, don’t doubt, always smile … and you will be saved.\nNope. Just confess and believe. Salvation will follow—along with the peace and inner joy that come from knowing your ultimate destination. ',
