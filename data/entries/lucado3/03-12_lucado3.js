    "body": 'If you lose your faith, you will probably do so a little at a time. You will let a few days slip by without consulting your compass. Your sails will go untrimmed. Your rigging will go unprepared. And worst of all, you will forget to anchor your boat. And, before you know it, you’ll be bouncing from wave to wave in stormy seas.\nAnd unless you anchor deep, you could go down. How do you anchor deep? Look at the verse again: “We must pay the most careful attention … to what we have heard.”\nThe most reliable anchor points are not recent discoveries. They are time-tested truths that have held their ground against the winds of change. Truths like: My life is not futile. My failures are not fatal. My death is not final.\nAttach your soul to these boulders and no wave is big enough to wash you under. ',
