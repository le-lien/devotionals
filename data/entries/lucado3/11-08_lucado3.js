    "body": 'Do you avoid talking to God because you don’t think he’ll understand your troubles? According to the Bible he can: “Jesus understands every weakness of ours, because he was tempted in every way that we are. But he did not sin!” (Hebrews 4:15 CEV).\nIt’s as if the writer of Hebrews knows we will say, “God, it’s easy for you up there. You don’t know how hard it is down here.” So he boldly proclaims Jesus’ ability to understand. Look at the wording again. Jesus. Not an angel.\nNot an ambassador. Jesus himself. Understands every weakness. Not some of them. Not most. Every one. Was tempted in every way that we are. He’s been through every hurt and ache, every stress and strain, and knows how they weaken us.\nEvery page of the Gospels hammers home this key point: God knows how you feel. When you say you’ve reached your limit, he gets what you mean. When you shake your head at impossible deadlines, he shakes his too.\nWhen your plans are interrupted by people with other plans, he nods because he knows.\nHe’s been there. ',
