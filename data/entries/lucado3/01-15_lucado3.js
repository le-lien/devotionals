    "body": 'God has one goal: God. “I have my reputation to keep up” (Isaiah 48:11\nMSG). Surprised? Isn’t such an attitude, dare we ask, self-centered? Why does God broadcast himself?\nFor the same reason the pilot of the lifeboat does. Think of it this way.\nYou’re floundering neck-deep in a dark, cold sea. Ship sinking. Life jacket deflating. Through the inky night comes the voice of a lifeboat pilot. But you cannot see him. What do you want the driver of the lifeboat to do? Be quiet?\nSay nothing?\nBy no means! You need volume! Amp it up, buddy! In biblical jargon, you want him to show his glory. You need to hear him say, “I am here. I am strong. I can save you!” Drowning passengers want the pilot to reveal his supremacy.\nDon’t we want God to do the same? Look around. People thrash about in seas of guilt, anger, despair. Life isn’t working. We are going down fast. But God can rescue us. And only one message matters. His! We need to see God’s glory. ',
