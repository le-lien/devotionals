And even though we’ve been saved by Jesus, we say, “Well, things could be better.” Or “Couldn’t get into the class I wanted.” Or “My parents won’t let me go to the party.” Or “People won’t leave me alone so I can finish my report on selfishness.”\nAre you so focused on what you don’t have that you can’t see what you do?\nYou have a ticket to heaven no thief can take,\nan eternal home no divorce can break.\nEvery sin of your life has been cast to the sea.\nEvery mistake you’ve made is nailed to the tree.\nYou’re blood-bought and heaven-made.\nA child of God—forever saved.\nSo be grateful, joyful—for isn’t it true?\nWhat you don’t have is much less\nthan what you do.
