    "body": 'Watch.” Warnings don’t come any more practical than that. Watch. Stay alert. Keep your eyes open. When you see sin coming, duck. When you anticipate an awkward encounter, turn around. When you sense temptation, go the other way.\nWhat Jesus was saying to the disciples and also to us is, “Pay attention.”\nYou know your weaknesses. You also know the situations in which your weaknesses are most vulnerable. Stay out of those situations. Backseats. Late hours. Offensive websites. Whatever it is that gives Satan a foothold in your life, stay away from it. Watch out!\nJesus also says, “Pray.” Prayer isn’t telling God anything new. There is neither a sinner nor a saint who would surprise him. What prayer does is invite God to walk the shadowy pathways of life with us. Prayer is asking God to watch ahead for falling trees and tumbling boulders and to bring up the rear, guarding our backside from the poison darts of the devil. ',

      "text": 'Navigating the dangerous waters of life is a little like swimming at the beach with no lifeguard on duty—it’s up to you to watch for trouble and make sure an undertow doesn’t suck you in. Through prayer, you can invite a holy lifeguard to join you and protect you. He’s always on duty.'
