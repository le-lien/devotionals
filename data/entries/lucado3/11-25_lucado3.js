    "body": 'Nathaniel Hawthorne came home heartbroken. He’d just been fired from his job in the custom house. His wife, rather than responding with anxiety, surprised him with joy. “Now you can write your book!”\nHe wasn’t so positive. “And what shall we live on while I’m writing it?”\nTo his amazement she opened a drawer and revealed a wad of money she’d saved out of her housekeeping budget. “I always knew you were a man of genius,” she told him. “I always knew you’d write a masterpiece.”\nShe believed in her husband. And because she did, he wrote. And because he wrote, every library in America has a copy of The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne.\nYou have the power to change someone’s life simply by the words you speak. “Death and life are in the power of the tongue.” Use your power wisely, and you may soon witness a masterpiece.
