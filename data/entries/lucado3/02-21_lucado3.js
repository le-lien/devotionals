If you’re anything like me, it’s probably been too long.\nJesus didn’t let that happen. Spend much time reading about the listening life of Christ and a distinct pattern emerges. He made a deliberate effort to devote regular time to God, praying and listening. Mark says, “Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed” (Mark 1:35 NIV). For Jesus, God time apparently came before sleeping in, other appointments, checking for e-mails, and just about everything else.\nLet me ask the obvious. If Jesus, the Son of God, the sinless Savior of humankind, thought it worthwhile to clear his calendar to pray, wouldn’t we be wise to do the same? ',

The rest starts to feel as empty as a drum.'
