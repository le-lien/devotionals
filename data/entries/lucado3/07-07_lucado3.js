    "body": 'Jesus tells us, “This is how you should pray: ‘Our Father in heaven, let your name be kept holy. Let your kingdom come’” (Matthew 6:9–10 GOD’S\nWORD).\nWhen you say, “Let your kingdom come,” you are inviting the Messiah himself to walk into your world. “Come, my King! Take your place as our ruler. Be present in my heart. Be present in my classroom. Come into my family. Be Lord of my friendships, my fears, and my doubts.” This is no feeble request; it’s a bold appeal for God to occupy every corner of your life.\nIt is saying you understand that coaches, teachers, principals, and presidents do not have ultimate authority. Only him.\nWho are you to ask such a thing? Who are you to ask God to take control of your world? You are his child, for heaven’s sake! And so you can ask boldly. ',
