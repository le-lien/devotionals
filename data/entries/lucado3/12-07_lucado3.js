    "body": 'Did you know that if you are involved in a legal trial, you don’t always have to be present in court? Sometimes your lawyer can speak for you. He understands court cases when you don’t, and he speaks legalese while you stumble over the words.\nYou may have never gone to court, but you can still be living in crisis.\nThe kind that has you so wiped out and stressed out that you can’t talk even to God. The good news is you also have an advocate standing before the Father.\nWhen you are timid, Jesus speaks. He stands in for us when we just can’t speak for ourselves. And we have support from the Holy Spirit, who\n“intercedes for us through wordless groans” (Romans 8:26–27 NIV). Those gross sounds coming from your tired soul? It’s okay. The Holy Spirit speaks Groan-ese. “Uuuggghhh”—Help me, Lord. Get me out of this misery.\n“Uhhhhhh”—I don’t know what to do. The pain is too much. “Ooohhhhhh”—\nWhere is everyone?\nGod understands when you’re so overwhelmed that you can’t pray. With Jesus as your advocate and the Holy Spirit as your prayer partner, I bet you’ve been praying more than you think. ',
