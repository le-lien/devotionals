    "body": 'Jesus stands before Pilate, accused of crimes he did not commit. The Roman governor does all he can to release Jesus. Why? “I find no fault in Him at all” (John 18:38). With these words, Pilate unintentionally steps into the sandals of spiritual teacher. He states first what Paul would record later: Jesus\n“knew no sin” (2 Corinthians 5:21). Of equal ranking with Jesus’ water walking, dead raising, and disease healing is this skyscraper-tall truth: he never sinned.\nJesus was God’s model of a human being. Ever honest among hypocrites.\nRelentlessly kind in a world of cruelty. Heaven-focused in spite of countless distractions. It’s not just that Jesus passed every test. He posted a perfect score on every test.\nCan you imagine such a life? No mistakes? Not a single red mark on your essays? Me either. That’s why God found a way to punish the sin and preserve the sinner. Jesus took your punishment, and God gave you credit for Jesus’\nperfection.\nSounds perfect to me. ',
