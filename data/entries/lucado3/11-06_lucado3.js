    "body": 'Do you ever find life a little … boring? That will change one day. You won’t be bored in heaven because you won’t be the same you in heaven.\nBoredom emerges from weeds that heaven doesn’t allow. The weed of weariness: our eyes tire. The weed of mental limitations: information overload dulls us. The weed of self-centeredness: we grow disinterested when the spotlight shifts to others. The weed of tedium: meaningless activity steals our energy. But there are no weeds in heaven. You’re left with a keen mind, endless focus, and God-honoring assignments.\nYes, you will have assignments in heaven. “[God’s] servants shall serve Him” (Revelation 22:3). What is service if not responsible activity? Those who are faithful over a few things will rule over many (Matthew 25:21).\nYou might oversee the orbit of a distant planetary system . . . design a mural in the new city … monitor the expansion of a new species of plants or animals. What does a Creator do but create? What do his happy children do but serve him? ',
