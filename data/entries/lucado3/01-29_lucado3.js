    "body": 'When I was fifteen, I made a plan to get drunk. The details involved me, a friend, and a case of quarts. I drank beer until I couldn’t see straight then went home and vomited until I couldn’t stand up. My dad came to the bathroom, smelled the beer, threw a towel in my direction, and walked away in disgust.\nThat was the beginning of some wayward years for one Max Lucado. I lied to my parents. I lied to friends. I focused on me, me, me. And I drank.\nWith gusto.\nI was a sophomore in college the last time I got drunk. I’d quit going to church because I didn’t think God would want me back. But the influence of a few good friends and a minister helped me see that the whole reason Jesus died on the cross was for people like me.\nIt was a life-changing discovery. I realized that God is always ready to grant a second chance. So I grabbed it—and have been grateful ever since. ',
