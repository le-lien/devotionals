Serve with an inner-city youth ministry or a short-term mission in Mexico? Music camp or Young Life camp? How do you decide?\nLike a pilot before takeoff, I always go over my preflight checklist before any trips into the unknown. I ask myself three questions: Where has God taken me before?  I remember all the places God sent me in the past, the experiences I faced, the cultures I embraced, the lifestyles I encountered. God uses past experiences to overcome present problems. What people and places excite me?  We all have different passions and burdens. Some like to serve in foreign countries. Others like to help their neighbors. What am I good at?  We each have at least one unique talent, and we are expected to do that one thing well.\nOnce you’ve been through your checklist, talk to God about it. He’ll help you decide. Then you’ll be ready to fly! ',
