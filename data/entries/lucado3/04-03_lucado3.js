On one side there is the voice of safety.\nYou can build a fire in the hearth, stay inside, and stay warm and dry. You can’t fall if you don’t take a stand, right? You can’t lose your balance if you never climb, right? So don’t try it. Take the safe route.\nOr you can hear the voice of adventure—God’s adventure. Instead of building a fire in your hearth, build a fire in your heart. Follow God’s impulses. Talk to the girl no one talks to. Volunteer at the senior center. Try out for the play or team. Lead a Bible study. Run for school president. Make a difference. Sure, it isn’t safe, but what is?\nJesus didn’t play it safe. He died on a cross for you. Allow him to lead you into your own God-inspired destiny. ',
