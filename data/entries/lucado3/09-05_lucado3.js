    "body": 'In the 1760s, a mother and daughter walked up and down a line of recently rescued captives. Their daughter and sister, Regina, had been taken by Indians nearly ten years earlier. Could Regina be among these pale and emaciated souls? None looked familiar. Then someone had an idea: was there a childhood memory or song?\nMother and daughter again walked slowly up and down the rows, singing a song from the girls’ childhood. Suddenly a tall, slender girl rushed out of the crowd toward her mother, embraced her, and began to sing the verse. Regina had not recognized her family, but she remembered the song placed in her heart as a young girl. 11\nGod places a song in the hearts of his children too. A song of hope and life. Sometimes this song falls silent. Life’s hurts and happenings mute the music within. Yet God’s never-ending grace calls us home. Even when we mess up. Even if we are lost, cut off from his family for years. Eventually we hear his voice, and something within us awakens. And when it does, we begin to sing again. ',
