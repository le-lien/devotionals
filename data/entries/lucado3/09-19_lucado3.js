    "body": 'The most powerful life is the simplest life. The most powerful life is the life that knows where it’s going, that knows where its strength comes from, and that stays free of clutter and hurry.\nBeing busy is not a sin. Jesus was busy. Paul was busy. Peter was busy.\nNothing of significance is achieved without effort and hard work and weariness. Being busy, in and of itself, is not a sin. But being busy in an endless pursuit of things that leave us empty and hollow and broken inside—\nthat cannot be pleasing to God.\nOne source of man’s weariness is the pursuit of things that can never satisfy; but which one of us has not been caught up in that? Our pleasures, possessions, and pride—these are all dead things. When we try to get life out of dead things, we end up tired and unsatisfied. Keep it simple. Love and follow God. ',
