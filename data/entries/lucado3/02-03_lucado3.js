    "body": 'What of those days of double shadows? Those days when hope is doused by disaster? You wake up remembering you wrecked the family car. Or that your dad just lost his job. Or that your mom was diagnosed with cancer.\nWho has a good day on these days?\nMost don’t … but couldn’t we try? After all, “this is the day the Lord has made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.” The first word in the verse leaves us scratching our heads. “This is the day the Lord has made”? Perhaps holidays are the days the Lord has made. Wedding days are the days the Lord has made. Easter Sundays … snow days … vacation days—these are the days the Lord has made. But this day?\n“This is the day” includes every day. Final exam days, surgery days, detention days. God made this day, ordained this hard hour, designed the details of this wrenching moment. He isn’t on holiday. He still holds the conductor’s baton, sits in the cockpit, and occupies the universe’s only throne.\nEach day emerges from God’s drawing board. Including this one. ',
