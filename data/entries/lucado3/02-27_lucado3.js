    "body": 'Our Master has a strict honor code. From Genesis to Revelation, the theme is the same: God loves the truth and hates deceit. “The LORD detests lying lips, but he delights in those who tell the truth” (Proverbs 12:22 NLT).\nTruth-telling isn’t always easy. You don’t want to go out but don’t want to hurt your friend’s feelings. Can’t you just say you have too much homework?\nYou forgot the time and missed your curfew. Can’t you just tell your parents the car wouldn’t start?\nLies have no place among God’s people. In 1 Corinthians 6:9–10, Paul lists the type of people who will not inherit God’s kingdom. The gang includes those who sin sexually, worship idols, take part in adultery, sell their bodies, get drunk, rob people, and—there it is—lie about others.\nYour fibbing stirs the same heavenly anger as adultery and aggravated assault? Apparently so. God loves the truth, so dishonesty is the opposite of everything he stands for. ',
