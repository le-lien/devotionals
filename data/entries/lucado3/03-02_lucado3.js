I used to wear my wristwatch on the inside of my arm so I wouldn’t lose the millisecond it took to turn my wrist.\nWhat insanity!\nI wonder if I could have obeyed God’s ancient command to keep the Sabbath holy. To slow life to a crawl for twenty-four hours? The Sabbath was created for frantic souls like me. People who need this weekly reminder: the world will not stop if you do.\nMaybe you need the reminder too. Too many late nights of studying and Internet surfing? Is your schedule overflowing, leaving you drowning? This is why God insisted that we set aside a day for rest and time with him. He knows how much we need it, and how unlikely we are to take it. So hurry up and schedule it! Step away from insanity and into serenity. ',
