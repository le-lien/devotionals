    "body": 'Do you ever talk about people behind their backs? It’s called gossip.\nPerhaps you intend to hurt with your words, perhaps not; but that doesn’t matter. Thanks to you, someone ends up on the floor because of a slur or slip of the tongue. And there the person lies, wounded and bleeding. Bruised feelings, punctured pride, broken heart.\nMary probably knew just what that felt like. An unmarried teen, pregnant.\nStares and whispers when she walked by: “I guess Mary isn’t the good girl we thought she was.” But the gossipers didn’t have all the facts. No one told them that Mary carried the Savior of the world.\nYou don’t have all the facts either. So don’t spread rumors or bad news or make accusations about others. Walk away when someone else does it. Make these words from Ephesians your motto: “Don’t say anything that would hurt another person. Instead, speak only what is good so that you can give help wherever it is needed” (4:29 GOD’S WORD). ',

      "text": 'Can you imagine Jesus hanging out with friends, sharing secrets about a disciple who isn’t there? Can you imagine someone being inspired by your Christian example if you do it? When gossipers gab, everyone gets hurt. MARCH Trust in the LORD with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding. [ Proverbs 3:5 ]'
