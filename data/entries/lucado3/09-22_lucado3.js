    "body": 'Two types of voices command your attention today. Negative ones fill your mind with doubt, bitterness, and fear. Positive ones provide hope and strength. Which ones will you choose to listen to? You have a choice, you know. “We take every thought captive so that it is obedient to Christ” (2\nCorinthians 10:5 GOD’S WORD).\nDo you let anyone who knocks on your door enter your house? Don’t let every thought that surfaces make a home in your mind. Take it captive . . .\nmake it obey Jesus. If it refuses, don’t think it.\nNegative thoughts never strengthen you. How many times have you changed a test score with your grumbles? Does groaning about zits make them disappear? Why moan about your aches and pains, problems and challenges?\n“Be careful what you think, because your thoughts run your life”\n(Proverbs 4:23 NCV). ',

      "text": 'Minds race. Minds wander. Minds can turn mindless. The ideas and thoughts that hike through your head are like sheep—they need to be corralled. Let’s put them in the pen with the “positive” sign on the gate. They’ll be much happier there, and so will you.'
