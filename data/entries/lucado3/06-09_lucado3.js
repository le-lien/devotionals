    "body": 'Perhaps the wound is old. A parent abused you. A teacher slighted you. A friend betrayed you. And you are angry. Or perhaps the wound is fresh.\nThe buddy who owes you money just rode by on his new bike. The boyfriend who made so many promises last week has forgotten how to pronounce your name. And you are hurt.\nPart of you is broken, and the other part is bitter. Part of you wants to cry, and part of you wants to fight. There is a fire burning in your heart. It’s the fire of anger.\nAnd you are left with a decision. “Do I put the fire out or heat it up? Do I get over it or get even? Do I release it or resent it? Do I let my hurts heal, or do I let hurt turn into hate?”\nHate is wrong. Revenge is bad. But the worst part of all is that without forgiveness, bitterness is all that’s left. ',
