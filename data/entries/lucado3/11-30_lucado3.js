    "body": 'The LORD does not see as man sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart” (1 Samuel 16:7).\nThose words were written for the misfits and outcasts of society. God uses them all. Moses ran from justice. Jonah ran from God. Rahab ran a brothel. God used them.\nAnd David? God saw a teenage boy serving him in the backwoods of Bethlehem, at the intersection of boredom and anonymity, and through the voice of a brother, God called, “David! Come in. Someone wants to see you.”\nHuman eyes saw a gangly teenager enter the house. Yet, “the LORD said,\n‘Arise, anoint him; for this is the one!’” (1 Samuel 16:12).\nGod saw what no one else saw: a God-seeking heart. David, for all his faults, sought God like a lark seeks sunrise. In the end, that’s all God wanted or needed, all he wants or needs. Others measure your waist size or wallet.\nNot God. He examines hearts. When he finds one set on him, he calls it and claims it. ',

He sees what’s in your heart. Allow him to make use of yours. DECEMBER For unto us a Child is born, Unto us a Son is given; And the government will be upon His shoulder. And His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. [ Isaiah 9:6 ]'
