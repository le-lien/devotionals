    "body": 'In the final days of Jesus’ life, he shared a meal with his friends Lazarus, Martha, and Mary. For Mary, however, giving the dinner was not enough.\n“Mary came in with a jar of very expensive aromatic oils, anointed and massaged Jesus’ feet, and then wiped them with her hair. The fragrance of the oils filled the house” (John 12:3 MSG). Jesus received this as a generous demonstration of love, a friend surrendering her most treasured gift.\nFollow Mary’s example.\nThere is an elderly man in your community who just lost his wife. An hour of your time would mean the world to him. Some kids in your school have no dad. No father takes them to movies or baseball games. Maybe you and yours can.\nOr how about this one? Down the hall from your bedroom is a person who shares your last name. Shock that person with kindness. Something radical. Your homework done with no complaints. Coffee served before he awakens. A love letter written to her for no special reason. Daily do a deed for which you cannot be repaid. ',
