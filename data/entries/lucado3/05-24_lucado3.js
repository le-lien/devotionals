    "body": 'Peer into the prison and see Paul for yourself: bent and frail, shackled to the arm of a Roman guard as he awaits trial. Behold the apostle of God. Dead broke. No family. No property. Nearsighted and worn out.\nNo Superman, Batman, or Spider-Man is Paul. He doesn’t look anything like a superhero.\nDoesn’t sound like one either. He introduced himself as the worst sinner in history. He was a Christian-killer before he was a Christian leader. At times his heart was so heavy, Paul could barely drag his pen across the page. “What a miserable man I am! Who will save me from this body that brings me death?” (Romans 7:24 NCV).\nOnly heaven knows how long he stared at the question before he found the courage to defy logic and write, “I thank God for saving me through Jesus Christ our Lord!” (Romans 7:25 NCV). Paul became a superhero of the Christian faith only when he put his faith and trust in Christ. ',

      "text": 'Do you admire the fictional superheroes in the comic books and on the movie screens? They display powers and deeds of daring that real people can only dream of. Yet you do have the opportunity to be a superhero. When you join your life to Jesus, you connect to a power that makes made-up superheroes look tame.'
