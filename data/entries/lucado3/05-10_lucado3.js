All the razor-sharp comments that filled our minds checked at the door. What’s left? A better, brighter, and purer child of God.\nBut here’s the thing—we don’t have to die to enjoy some of heaven’s blessings here on earth. What it takes is pure minds and bodies. “Flee also youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart” (2 Timothy 2:22). That gorgeous guy in second period? Those images of women on the Internet? Turn your gaze and thoughts in a new direction. God wants you to see them not as appetizers for the eyes but as his cherished children.\nEasier said than done? You know it. But the payoff of purity today is peace of mind and a heart that is ready for heaven. ',
