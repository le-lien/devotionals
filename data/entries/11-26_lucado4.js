    "body": 'Once there were a couple of farmers who couldn’t get along with each other. A wide, deep ditch separated their two farms, but as a sign of their hatred for each other, each farmer built a fence on his side of the ditch to keep the other out.\nIn time, however, the daughter of one farmer met the son of the other, and the couple fell in love. They were determined not to be kept apart by the foolishness of their fathers. So they tore down the fence and used the wood to build a bridge across the ditch.\nThat’s just what confession does. When you tell God your sins, you tear down the fence that separates you from Him. Confession, then, becomes the bridge over which you can walk back into God’s arms.\nGrowing in Grace\nWhat would happen if there weren’t any bridges? There would be no crossing over rivers or lakes or canyons. You simply wouldn’t be able to get where you wanted to go. And if it weren’t for Jesus—the bridge between our sin and God—we wouldn’t be able to get to where we want to go. Heaven.\nNOVEMBER 27\nJesus Knows Us by Name\nThe Lord is my shepherd.\nI have everything I need.\n—PSALM 23:1\nSheep aren’t smart. They have a habit of wandering into running creeks for water. Then their wool soaks up the water, gets heavy, and causes them to drown. They need a shepherd to lead them to “calm water” (Psalm 23:2).\nSheep cannot protect themselves. They have no claws, no horns, no fangs. They are helpless. Sheep need a shepherd with a “rod and . . .\nwalking stick” to protect them (Psalm 23:4). Sheep have no sense of direction. They need someone to lead them “on paths that are right” (Psalm 23:3).\nWe need a shepherd too. Because we, too, have a habit of getting stuck in troubles we should have avoided. Because we cannot defend ourselves against the evil lion—the devil—who prowls around seeking some lost soul to devour. And because we sometimes lose our way in life. We need a Shepherd to care for us, to protect us, and to guide us. And we have one— ',
