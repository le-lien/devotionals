    "body": 'et‘s take a look at the fifth chapter of 1 Peter . “Humble yourselves” (v. 6). Look at the Master at the Jordan River, L submitting Himself to the baptism of John, then again submitting Himself to the cruel Cross. Truly, angels desire to look into these things (1 Pet. 1:12), and all heaven is waiting for the man who will burn all the bridges behind him and allow God to begin a plan in righteousness, so full, so sublime, beyond all human thought, but according to the revelation of the Spirit.\n\n“Casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you”  (1 Pet. 5:7). He cares! We sometimes forget this. If we descend into the natural, all goes wrong, but when we trust Him and abide beneath His shadow, how blessed it is. Oh, many times I have experienced my helplessness and nothingness, and casting my care upon Him has proved that He cares.\n\nVerse eight tells us to “be sober, be vigilant.”  What does it mean to be sober? It means to have a clear knowledge that we are powerless to manage, but also to have a rest of faith. The Adversary‘s opportunity is when we think that we are something and try to open our own door. Our thoughts, words, and deeds must all be in the power of the Holy Spirit. Oh yes, we need to be sober—not only sober, but also vigilant. We need not only to be filled with the Spirit but also to have a "go forth"   in us, a knowledge that God‘s holy presence is with us. To be sober and vigilant, to have an ability to judge, discern, and balance things that differ—this is what we need.\n\n“Your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. Resist him, steadfast in the faith”  (vv. 8– 9). We must resist in the hour when Satan‘s schemes may bewilder us, when we are almost swept off our feet, and when darkness is upon us to such a degree that it seems as if some evil thing had overtaken us. “Resist him, steadfast in the faith.”  “He who keeps 300\n\nIsrael shall neither slumber nor sleep”  (Ps. 121:4). God covers us, for no human can stand against the powers of hell.\n\n“After you have suffered a while”  (1 Pet. 5:10). Then there is some suffering? Yes! But it is “not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us”  (Rom. 8:18). The difference is so great that our suffering is not even worthy of mention. Ours is an eternal glory, from glory to glory, until we are swallowed up, until we are swallowed up in Him, the Lord of glory.',
