    "body": 'We disobey. God convicts and restores. We doubt. God works to make us people of faith. We hunger. God feeds us with the bounty of his grace.\nPlenteous grace is what we’re given; grace that is deeper, fuller,\nricher,\nand greater\nthan our sin.\nThis grace does not suspend operations in the face of our disobedience.\nIt will not\nturn its back in the face of our doubt.\nIt will not stand idly by\nin the face of our hunger.\nNo, this is\nrich grace,\nperseverant grace tender grace, powerful grace.\nThere really is nothing like it,\nbecause it comes from the hand of Jesus.',
