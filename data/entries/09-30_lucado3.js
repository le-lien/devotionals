    "body": 'J. J. Jasper and his little boy, Cooper, were having a blast riding in a dune buggy. Then the buggy flipped. And before he knew it, J. J. found himself doing the unthinkable: selecting a casket, planning a funeral, and imagining life without his only son. J. J. told me, “There is no class or book on this planet that can prepare you to have your five-year-old son die in your arms…\n. We know what the bottom looks like.”\nThe bottom. The place where rejection, humiliation, and tragedy live.\nWhere hope takes the highway. Friends too. Who’s left? God is.\nDavid asked, “Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence?” (Psalm 139:7). He then listed the places he found God: in\n“heaven … hell … [in] the morning … in the uttermost parts of the sea” (vv.\n8–9). God, everywhere.\nYou will never go where God is not. Standing in front of a class? Crying alone in your room? Stuck at the bottom? God will be there. And he brings the comfort and strength that only a Father can.\nONE MORE THOUGHT\nUp one moment, down the next. Life can flip faster than a dune buggy, leaving us on the bottom, wondering what happened and feeling very alone.\nBut we’re not alone. God will find you even here, and he offers his unlimited power to lift you back up.\nOCTOBER ',
