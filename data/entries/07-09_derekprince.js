    "body": 'Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own?\n(1 Corinthians 6:19 nasb)\nWhy are you not your own? Because somebody else has bought you. When you have been bought by somebody else, then you no longer belong to yourself.\nWho bought you? Jesus. With what method of payment? His blood.\nSo, if you have been bought by Jesus, remember, you do not belong to yourself. If you belong to yourself, then you are not bought with the blood of Jesus. Again, you cannot belong to yourself and to the Lord.\nThe Lord wants you for Himself. He has paid the price of His precious blood. If you want to hold on to your own life, then, remember, you have not been bought with a price. You cannot have it both ways. If you belong to God, you do not belong to yourself. If you belong to yourself, you do not belong to God.\nFor you have been bought with a price [the precious blood of Jesus] : therefore [because of the price that has been paid for you]  glorify [honor] God in your body.\n(verse 20)\nWhen Jesus died on the cross, He paid a total price for a total redemption. He did not redeem just a part of you. He redeemed the whole of you—spirit, soul, and body. Jesus died to redeem you. If you have accepted redemption through His blood, then you are not your own; you now belong to Him. Both your spirit and your body are God’s, because Jesus paid the price of His blood to possess you. ',
