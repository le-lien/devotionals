If the majority had ruled, David never would have fought Goliath.\nHis brothers would have voted for him to stay with the sheep. What’s the point? You must listen to your own heart.\nGod says you’re on your way to becoming a disciple when you can keep a clear head and a pure heart.\nDo you ever wonder if everything will turn out right as long as you do everything right? Do you ever try to do something right and yet nothing seems to turn out like you planned? Take heart—when people do what is right, God remembers. ',
