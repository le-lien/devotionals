    "body": 'Time has skyrocketed in value. The value of any commodity depends on its scarcity. And time that once was abundant now is going to the highest bidder… .\nWhen I was ten years old, my mother enrolled me in piano lessons… .\nSpending thirty minutes every afternoon tethered to a piano bench was a torture… .\nSome of the music, though, I learned to enjoy. I hammered the staccatos.\nI belabored the crescendos… . But there was one instruction in the music I could never obey to my teacher’s satisfaction. The rest. The zigzagged command to do nothing. What sense does that make? Why sit at the piano and pause when you can pound?\n“Because,” my teacher patiently explained, “music is always sweeter after a rest.”\nIt didn’t make sense to me at age ten. But now, a few decades later, the words ring with wisdom— divine wisdom. ',
