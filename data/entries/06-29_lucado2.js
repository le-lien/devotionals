Are you making some? Are you drinking too much? Are you cheating at work or cheating at marriage? Are you mismanaging money?\nAre you mismanaging your life?\nIf so, don’t pretend nothing is wrong. Don’t pretend you don’t fall. Don’t try to get back in the game. Go first to God. The first step after a stumble must be in the direction of the cross. ',
