No light falls on me.\nLesser orbs, that’s us. Appreciated. Valued. Loved dearly. But central?\nEssential? Pivotal? Nope. Sorry. The world does not revolve around us. Our comfort is not God’s priority. If it is, something’s gone wrong. If we are the marquee event, how do we explain flat-earth challenges like death, disease, slumping economies, or rumbling earthquakes? If God exists to please us, then shouldn’t we always be pleased?\nCould a cosmic shift be in order? Perhaps our place is not at the center of the universe. God does not exist to make a big deal out of us. We exist to make a big deal out of him. It’s not about you. It’s not about me. It’s all about him. ',

Might be a good idea, right now, to get on your knees and worship the One at the center of the universe.'
