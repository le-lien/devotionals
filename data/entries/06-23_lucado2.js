Would you not do what she did? “She wrapped the baby with pieces of cloth” (Luke 2:7).\nThe baby Jesus, still wet from the womb, was cold and chilled. So this mother did what any mother would do; she did what love does: She covered him.\nWouldn’t you cherish an opportunity to do the same? You have one. Such opportunities come your way every day. Jesus said, “I was without clothes, and you gave me something to wear… . I tell you the truth, anything you did for even the least of my people here, you also did for me” (Matt. 25:36, 40). ',
