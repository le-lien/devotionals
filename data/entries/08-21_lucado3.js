    "body": 'Does hell serve a purpose? Remove it from the Bible and, at the same time, remove any idea that God is just and that his Word can be trusted.\nIf there is no hell, God is not fair. If there is no punishment of sin, heaven doesn’t care about the rapists and robbers and mass murderers of society. If there is no hell, God is blind toward the victims and has turned his back on those who pray for help. If there is no anger toward evil, then God is not love, for love hates that which is evil.\nTo say there is no hell is also to say God is a liar and his Scripture untrue.\nThe Bible repeatedly and strongly affirms that each person’s history is headed for one of two outcomes. Some will be saved. Some will be lost. God doesn’t force us into either destination. He lets us decide. Which do you choose? ',

      "text": 'Hell. A place of unimagined misery. How can a loving God allow such a space to exist? Yet how can he not? Does it seem right that those who do evil every day and are never sorry should never face a consequence? God would prefer that hell’s hotel remain empty. Let’s do all we can to make that idea come true.'
