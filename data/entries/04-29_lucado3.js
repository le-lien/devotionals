    "body": 'The cross. Can you turn any direction without seeing one? Perched atop a chapel. Carved into a graveyard headstone. Engraved in a ring or suspended on a chain. The cross is the universal symbol of Christianity.\n“Carrying his own cross, Jesus went out to a place called The Place of the Skull, which in the Hebrew language is called Golgotha” (John 19:17 NCV).\nAn odd choice, don’t you think? Strange that a tool of torture would come to represent a movement of hope.\nWhy is the cross the symbol of our faith? To find the answer look no further than the cross itself. Its design couldn’t be simpler. One beam horizontal—the other vertical. One reaches out—like God’s love. The other reaches up—as does God’s holiness. One represents the width of his love; the other reflects the height of his holiness. The cross is the intersection. The cross is where God forgave his children without lowering his standards.\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
