    "body": 'Is God distant? How can the touching, helping, healing presence of God come to us? Should we light a candle, sing chants, build an altar, give a backpack full of money? What invites the presence of God?\nGod’s present is his presence. God’s greatest gift is himself. Sunsets steal our breath. Caribbean blue stills our hearts. Newborn babies stir our tears. But take all these away—strip away the sunsets, oceans, and cooing babies—and leave us in the Sahara, and we still have reason to dance in the sand. Why?\nBecause God is with us.\nGod wants us to know. We are never alone. Ever. God loves you too much to leave you alone, so he hasn’t. He hasn’t left you alone with your fears, your worries, your disease, or your death. So kick up your heels for joy.\nHe is a personal God who loves and heals and helps. He doesn’t respond to magic potions or clever slogans. He looks for more. He looks for reverence, obedience, and God-hungry hearts. And when he sees them, he comes! ',
