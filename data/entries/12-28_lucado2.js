But Jesus used them to inspire us...\nMoses had a staff.\nDavid had a sling.\nSamson had a jawbone.\nRahab had a string.\nMary had some ointment.\nDorcas had a needle.\nAll were used by God.\nWhat do you have?\nGod inhabits the tiny seed, empowers the tiny deed... Don’t discount the smallness of your deeds.',
