No one else shares the street. Who comes close? Humanity’s best and brightest fade like dime-store rubies next to him.\nDismiss him? We can’t.\nResist him? Equally difficult. Don’t we need a God-man Savior? A just-God Jesus could make us but not understand us. A just-man Jesus could love us but never save us. But a God-man Jesus? Near enough to touch.\nStrong enough to trust. A next door Savior.\nA Savior found by millions to be irresistible. ',
