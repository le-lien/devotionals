It’s hard to wait for your turn. It’s hard to wait for Christmas, and sometimes it’s hard to wait for God. You may even start to think that He’s not doing anything. But God is always working in your life. You may hear nothing, but He is speaking. You may see nothing, but He is there working. With God there are no accidents. He uses everything that happens to bring you closer to Him.\nWhy does God ask you to wait? That’s a tough question to answer, but God’s timing is  always perfect. And He will always  do what is right for you.\nSo keep praying. God will give you just the right answer at just the right time. That’s a promise! ',
