So rather than spend time with God, listening for his voice, we’ll let others spend time with him and then benefit from their experience. Let them tell us what God is saying. After all, isn’t that why we pay preachers? …\nIf that is your approach, if your spiritual experiences are secondhand and not firsthand, I’d like to challenge you with this thought: Do you do that with others parts of your life? …\nYou don’t do that with vacations… . You don’t do that with romance… .\nYou don’t let someone eat on your behalf, do you? [There are] certain things no one can do for you.\nAnd one of those is spending time with God. ',
