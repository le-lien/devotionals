    "body": 'nother of the roles of the Holy Spirit that is necessary for today we find in John 14:26: A But the Comforter, which is the Holy [Spirit],  whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. (KJV)\n\nJesus said something very similar in a later chapter: “He will take of what is Mine and declare [reveal]  it to you”  (John 16:14). Everything that has been revealed to you was first taken. So, first, the Holy Spirit takes of what is Christ‘s and reveals it to you. Then you come to the place where you need another touch. What is it? In the necessity of your ministry, He will bring to your remembrance everything that you need in your ministry. That is an important thing for preachers. God will give us His Word, and if there is anything special we need, He will bring that to our memories, too. The Holy Spirit comes to bring the Word to our remembrance.\n\nI will throw this word out to you as a help for future reflection: “You shall receive power” (Acts 1:8). Oh, may God grant that we will not forget it!\n\nWhat do I mean by that? Many people, instead of standing on the rock-solid word of faith and believing that they have received the baptism with its anointing and power, say, "Oh, if I could only feel that I have received it!"\n\nVery often, your feelings are a place of discouragement. You have to get away from relying on human feelings or desires. Earthly desires are not God‘s desires. All thoughts of holiness, all thoughts of purity, all thoughts of power from the Holy Spirit are from above. Human thoughts are like clouds that belong to the earth. “[God‘s] thoughts are not [our] thoughts”  (Isa. 55:8).',
