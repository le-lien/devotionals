    "body": 'Jesus had a definition for greed.  He called it the practice of measuring life by possessions.\nGreed equates a person’s worth with a person’s purse.\n1. You got a lot = you are a lot.\n2. You got a little = you are little.\nThe consequence of such a philosophy is predictable. If you are the sum of what you own, then by all means own it all. No price is too high. No payment is too much… .\nGreed is not defined by what something costs; it is measured by what it costs you.\nIf anything costs you your faith or your family, the price is too high. ',
