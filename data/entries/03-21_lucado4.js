    "body": 'When a friend came to Jesus and told Him that Lazarus was sick, he said, “Lord, the one you love is sick” (John 11:3).\nThe man didn’t come to Jesus and talk about Lazarus’s imperfect love for Jesus. He didn’t say, “The one who loves You  is sick.” No. He reminded Jesus of His perfect love for Lazarus. He said, “The one You love  is sick.”\nWhen you talk to Jesus in prayer, the power of the prayer is not in you, the one who says the prayer. The power is in the One who hears the prayer.\nSo when you pray, you can use the same words as Lazarus’s friend: “The one You love is sick … tired … sad … hungry … lonely … afraid.” You can pray this way, because you  are the one Jesus loves.
