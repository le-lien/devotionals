But being there in the flesh sends a message.\nAfter Albert Einstein’s wife died, his sister, Maja, moved in. For fourteen years she cared for him, allowing his valuable research to continue. In 1950\nshe suffered a stroke and lapsed into a coma. Thereafter, Einstein spent two hours every afternoon reading aloud to her. She gave no sign of understanding his words, but he read anyway. If she understood anything by his gesture, she understood this—he believed that she was worth his time.\nDo you believe in your family? Then show up. Show up at your brother’s games and sister’s plays. Do you believe in your friends? Then show up.\nShow up at their concerts when they play a solo and at their bedside when they’ve had a wreck. You want to bring out the best in someone? Then show up.\nAfter all, that’s what Jesus did. When we needed him most, he was there, in the flesh. ',
