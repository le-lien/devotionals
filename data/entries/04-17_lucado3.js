    "body": 'Jesus was born crucified. Whenever he became aware of who he was, he also became aware of what he had to do. The cross-shaped shadow could always be seen. And the screams of people imprisoned by sin could always be heard.\nThis explains the determination on his face as he turned to go to Jerusalem for the last time. He was on his death march (Luke 9:51). This explains the firmness in the words, “The Father loves me, because I give up my life, so that I may receive it back again. No one takes my life from me. I give it up willingly!” (John 10:17–18 CEV).\nSo call it what you wish: An act of grace. A martyr’s sacrifice. But whatever you call it, don’t call it an accident. Things did not just “happen” to Jesus. By following God’s will, he changed our history. It was God’s plan from the beginning. ',
