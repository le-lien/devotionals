Why did He make creation so amazing? Why did He go to such trouble to give us such gifts?\nWhy do you? You do the same thing. You hunch over a craft and bend over a drawing. There’s glue on your fingers and glitter in your hair. But this isn’t just any old gift. This is the extra-special gift for the extra-special person. Why do you do it? You do it so your mom’s eyes will shine. You do it so your dad’s jaw will drop. You do it to hear those words of disbelief:\n“You did this for me?” ',
