    "body": 'Most of my life I’ve been a closet slob. Then I got married. I enrolled in a support group for slobs. (“My name is Max, I hate to vacuum.”) A physical therapist helped me rediscover the muscles used for hanging shirts.\nMy nose was reintroduced to the smell of Pine-Sol.\nThen came the moment of truth. My wife, Denalyn, went out of town for a week. Initially I reverted to the old man. I figured I’d be a slob for six days and clean on the seventh. But something strange happened, a curious discomfort. I couldn’t relax with dirty dishes in the sink. What had happened to me? Simple. I’d been exposed to a higher standard.\nIsn’t that what has happened with us? Before we met Jesus we didn’t care about the world around us. We were mainly focused on ourselves. Our lives were a mess. But now we’re so much more aware of God’s people and God’s standards. Today we have a new model to follow—the best ever.\nONE MORE THOUGHT\nJesus is our model in life. It can be a little intimidating at times—he is perfect, after all. God doesn’t expect perfection from us, but he does call us to try every day to be more like Christ. The nice thing about that is, the closer we get, the better our lives and the greater our joy.\nFEBRUARY\nAnd we have known and believed the love\nthat God has for us. God is love, and he\nwho abides in love abides in God, and God ',
