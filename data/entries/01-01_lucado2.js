    "body": 'You were born prepacked. God looked at your entire life, determined your assignment, and gave you the tools to do the job.\nBefore traveling, you do something similar. You consider the demands of the journey and pack accordingly. Cold weather? Bring a jacket. Business meeting? Carry the laptop. Time with grandchildren? Better take some sneakers and pain medication.\nGod did the same with you. Joe will research animals . . . install curiosity. Meagan will lead a private school . . . an extra dose of management. I need Eric to comfort the sick … include a healthy share of compassion. Denalyn will marry Max . . . instill a double portion of patience.\nGod packed you on purpose for a purpose. ',
