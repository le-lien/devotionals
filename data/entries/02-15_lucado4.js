    "body": 'The greatest thing about Jesus was this: His heart was led by God. That means that His thoughts were always on God and how best to serve Him. This shows us how close He was to His Father. Jesus said, “I am in the Father and the Father is in me” (John 14:11).\nJesus took His instructions from God. It was His habit to go to worship (Luke 4:16) and to memorize Scripture (v. 4). Luke said that Jesus “often slipped away to other places to be alone so that he could pray” (5:16). His times of prayer allowed Him to hear God speaking to Him and leading Him.\nJesus once returned from prayer and chose His disciples (6:12–13). After another time of prayer, Jesus told the disciples it was time to move to another city (Mark 1:38). ',
