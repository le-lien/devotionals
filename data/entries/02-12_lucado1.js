But spend some time walking in the workshop of the heavens, seeing what God has done, and watch how your prayers are energized… .\nBehold the sun! Every square yard of the sun is constantly emitting 130,000 horse power, or the equivalent of 450 eight-cylinder automobile engines. And yet our sun, as powerful as it is, is but one minor star in the 100 billion orbs which make up our Milky Way Galaxy. Hold a dime in your fingers and extend it arm’s length toward the sky, allowing it to eclipse your vision, and you will block out fifteen million stars from your view… .\nBy showing us the heavens, Jesus is showing us his Father’s workshop… .\nHe taps us on the shoulder and says, “Your Father can handle that for you.” ',
