Why would heaven’s finest Son endure earth’s toughest pain?\nSo you would know that “he is able … to run to the cry of … those who are being tempted and tested and tried.”\nWhatever you are facing, he knows how you feel.\nNext Door Savior\nMay\nAccept teaching from his mouth,\nand keep his words in your heart.
