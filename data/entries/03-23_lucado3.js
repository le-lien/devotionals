    "body": 'Joseph’s father favored him, and Joseph’s brothers hated him for it. So they went nuclear on him. “They stripped Joseph of his tunic… . They took him and cast him into a pit” (Genesis 37:23–24). Joseph didn’t climb out of bed that morning and think, I better dress in padded clothing because this is the day I get tossed in a hole. The attack caught him off guard.\nSo did yours. Joseph’s pit came in the form of a cistern. Yours came in the form of a diagnosis, a foster home, a traumatic injury. Your pit feels like a kind of death. You wonder if you’ll ever recover.\nJoseph’s story got worse before it got better. Yet he never gave up.\nBitterness never staked its claim. He not only survived, he also thrived. By the end of his life, Joseph was the second most powerful man of his generation. How did he flourish in the middle of tragedy? Years later, Joseph explained it to his brothers. “You planned evil against me but God used those same plans for my good” (Genesis 50:20 MSG).\nTrust God to do the same for you. ',
