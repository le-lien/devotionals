    "body": 'From the file entitled “It Ain’t Gonna Happen,” I pull and pose this suggestion. Let’s make Christ’s command a federal law. Everyone has to make God’s love his or her home. Let it herewith be stated and hereby declared:\nNo person may walk out into the world to begin the day until he or she has stood beneath the cross to receive God’s love.\nCabbies. Presidents. Preachers. Tooth pullers and truck drivers. All required to linger at the fountain of his favor until all thirst is gone.\nDon’t you ache for the change we’d see? Less honking and locking horns, more hugging and helping kids. We’d pass fewer judgments and more compliments. Forgiveness would skyrocket.\nWild idea? I agree. God’s love can’t be legislated, but it can be chosen.\nChoose it, won’t you? For Christ’s sake, and yours, choose it. ',
