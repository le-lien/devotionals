As Paul rejoiced in prison; David wrote psalms in the wilderness; Jonah prayed in the fish belly; Paul and Silas sang in jail; and Jesus prayed in his garden of pain … Could we rejoice smack-dab in the middle of this day?\nImagine the difference if we could.\nSuppose neck-deep in a terrible day you resolve to give it a chance. You choose not to complain or work or worry it away but give it a fair shake. You trust more. Stress less. Amplify gratitude. Mute grumbling. And what do you know? Before long the day is done and surprisingly decent.\nSo decent, in fact, that you resolve to give the next day the same fighting chance. It arrives with its hang-ups and bang-ups, computer crashes and homework hassles, but by and large, by golly, giving the day a chance works!\nYou do the same the next day and the next. Days become a week. Weeks become months.\nIn such a fashion good lives are built. One good day at a time. ',
