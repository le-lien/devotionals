    "body": 'In his teaching that we call “The Sermon on the Mount” (Matthew 5–7) Jesus powerfully makes the point that sin is a heart problem. Yet we still find it difficult to accept and believe. We want to hold on to two operational falsehoods. The first is that sin is simply a matter of bad behavior. Maybe we want to hold on to this idea because sin seems less sinful if it isn’t some dark defect in our character. Or perhaps, if sin is just behavior, it seems that we have more independent power to free ourselves from it. All we need to do is give ourselves with discipline to systems of behavior reformation and we can free ourselves from sinful acts. But sin is not just a matter of behavior.\nThe second operational falsehood that we all tend to want to believe is that our sin is caused more by what is outside us than what is inside us. If you ask the little boy on the playground at school why he hit the little girl, he probably won’t talk about himself. He will point to someone or something outside himself as the cause of his behavior. We don’t want to face the fact that sin is caused by what’s inside us. We all tend to want to think that we are more righteous than we actually are.\nSo Jesus confronts our misperceptions about what sin is and what causes us to sin with these words:\nYou have heard that it was said to those of old, “You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.” But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. (Matt. 5:21–22)\nYou have heard that it was said, “You shall not commit adultery.” But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart. (Matt.\n5:27–28)\nWhat is Christ doing with these words? No, he is not redefining the law; he’s explaining to us the law’s original intent. God’s law is meant to address and expose the heart because sin is always a matter of the heart before it is an action of the body. It’s hatred within my heart that causes me to use the members of my\nbody to do harm to the body of another. It is the lustful desires of my heart that lead me to sexual sin. This is why the delivering grace of Christ is essential. You can escape many things, but you cannot escape your heart. In gorgeous mercy, God delivers you from you.',
