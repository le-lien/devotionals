    "body": 'Look at Peter. He is standing in a boat in the middle of a terrible storm.\nThere is nothing he can do to save himself. Then he sees Jesus walking on the water. Peter knows Jesus can save him. He calls to Jesus and steps out of the boat. But the waves are crashing all around, and Peter begins to sink. He doesn’t believe that he can make it all the way to Jesus. So he begs for help. He hears his Savior’s voice. Jesus catches him, and he is saved.\nThat is faith. Faith is knowing we cannot save ourselves. It is knowing that all the good things we do won’t keep us from sinking in sin. Faith is praying that Jesus will save us—and it is trusting that He really will. Paul wrote about this kind of faith: “You have been saved by grace because you believe. You did not save yourselves. It was a gift from God. You cannot brag that you are saved by the work you have done” (Ephesians 2:8–9). ',

Then remember the One who created all those scientific things. You can trust Him to keep you afloat no matter what troubles and storms come your way.'
