He prayed for the impossible to happen. That the cross would not be necessary.\nThe lesson here for us, though, is that Jesus prayed. When it seemed that the world had turned against Him, He prayed. When He felt all alone, He prayed. When it seemed impossible for Him to do what He needed to do, Jesus prayed. ',

There may come a time when you feel all alone and that no one understands. Say a prayer. There may even come a time when it seems impossible for you to do what you know you need to do. Say a prayer … just as Jesus did.',
