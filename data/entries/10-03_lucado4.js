    "body": 'There are many things you can do for yourself. You can tie your own shoes, pour your own milk, and ride a bike.\nThere are many things that you dream of doing. Things like making the school baseball team, making the perfect layup, or learning to play the clarinet. You may even have dreams of what you will be when you grow up maybe a veterinarian, an astronaut, a teacher, or even a preacher. These are great dreams. And with hard work and study, you can make many of these dreams come true.\nBut the greatest dream of all is one that you can’t do by yourself—no matter how hard you try. It’s God’s dream for you.\n“God has a way to make people right with him” (Romans 3:21). You must believe this. God’s greatest dream for you is not to make you rich or famous or popular. God’s greatest dream is to make you right with Him. ',
