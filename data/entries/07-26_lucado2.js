    "body": 'What a phenomenal list! Heavens and earth. Visible and invisible.\nThrones, dominions, rulers, and authorities. No thing, place, or person omitted. The scale on the sea urchin. The hair on the elephant hide. The hurricane that wrecks the coast, the rain that nourishes the desert, the infant’s first heartbeat, the elderly person’s final breath— all can be traced back to the hand of Christ, the firstborn of creation.\nFirstborn in Paul’s vernacular has nothing to do with birth order.\nFirstborn refers to order of rank. As one translation states: “He ranks higher than everything that has been made” (v.15 NCV). Everything? Find an exception. Peter’s mother-in-law has a fever; Jesus rebukes it. A tax needs to be paid; Jesus pays it by sending first a coin and then a fisherman’s hook into the mouth of a fish. Jesus … bats an eyelash, and nature jumps. ',
