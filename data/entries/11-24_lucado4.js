He is the brother of James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon. And his sisters are here with us” (Mark 6:3).\nAnd it may also surprise you to know that Jesus’ family was less than perfect. They were human, after all. Mark even told us that Jesus’ family didn’t always understand Him and why He was preaching. Once, they even tried to stop His preaching and take Him home because “people were saying that Jesus was out of his mind” (Mark 3:21). ',

And that’s just how He wants you to treat your family—even when they don’t understand you and you don’t understand them.',
