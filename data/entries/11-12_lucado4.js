And they may be able to hide them from other people. Mom may never know that word you said. Dad may never know who really broke the window. Your teacher may never find out who cheated on the test. But those sins aren’t really secret. Because the One who matters most knows. ',

God can’t make us right again until we tell Him we were wrong. Is there anything you need to tell God today?'
