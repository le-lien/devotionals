The problem is, it wouldn’t give the same satisfaction to my listeners as they held their ears.\nPaul gives good advice in Romans 12:3: “Have a sane estimate of your capabilities” (PHILLIPS).\nIn other words, be aware of your strengths. When you explain, do people understand? When you lead, do people follow? When you organize, do things improve? Where are you most productive? A big part of the teen years is trying different things to find out where you excel and what you most enjoy.\nIdentify your strengths, and then major in them. Failing to focus on your strengths may prevent you from accomplishing the unique tasks God has called you to do. Preaching? Writing? Singing? Pray about your future, and let God lead you to the gifts he wants you to use. ',
