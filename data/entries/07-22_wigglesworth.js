    "body": 'In the midst of persecuting the Lord‘s disciples, Saul was confronted with a bright light from heaven (Acts 9:3). A I voice spoke to him saying, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?”  (v. 4). Saul asked who was speaking, and when Jesus identified Himself, Saul‘s response was, “Lord, what do You want me to do?”  As soon as Saul was willing to yield, he was in a condition where God could meet his need, where God could display His power, where God could have the man.\n\nFriend, are you saying today, “What do You want me to do?” The place of yieldedness is just where God wants us. People are saying, "I want the baptism of the Holy Spirit. I want to be healed. I would like to know for certain that I am a child of God," and I see nothing, absolutely nothing, in the way, except that they have not yielded to the plan of God.\n\nIn Acts 19:6, the condition was met that Paul demanded, and when he laid his hands on the Ephesian disciples, they were instantly filled with the Spirit and spoke in other tongues and prophesied. The only thing they needed was just to be in the condition where God could come in.\n\nThe main thing today that God wants is obedience. When you begin yielding and yielding to God, He has a plan for your life, and you come in to that wonderful place where all you have to do is eat the fruits of Canaan.\n\nIt is the call of God that counts. Paul answered the call of God. I believe God wants to stir our heart today to obedience. Our response should be, “Lord, what do You want me to do?”',
