Though some appear to be distant relatives, they are not. God has no cousins, only children.\nWe are incredibly, the body of Christ. And though we may not act like our Father, there is no greater truth than this: We are his. Unalterably. He loves us. Undyingly. Nothing can separate us from the love of Christ (see Rom. 8:38–39). ',
