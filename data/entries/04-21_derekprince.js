    "body": 'Today, we will look more closely at the ingredients of the “Romans Recipe.” Romans 6 (niv) presents successive points of identification.\nFirst, “we died to sin”  (verse 1) when Jesus died, and we identify ourselves with His death. When Jesus was crucified, our “old self”  (verse 6), the rebel nature we inherited from Adam, was also crucified. Second,\n“we were…buried with him”  (verse 4). By baptism into His death, we died and were buried with Him. Third, we are “united with him in his resurrection”  (verse 5). Following Him through death and burial, we move out into His resurrection life, sharing His life with Him. The practical, successive consequences of this identification with Jesus in His death, burial, and resurrection are as follows: 1.  “The body of sin [is]  done away with”  (verse 6). The corrupt, evil nature that enslaved us and made us do wrong even when we desired to do right is rendered powerless. It has been put to death.\n2. Consequently, we are “no longer…slaves to sin”  (verse 6). Sin no longer compels us to do harmful, destructive things that will ultimately bring disaster upon us, on earth and in eternity.\n3. Then, we are “ freed from sin”  (verse 7). We are literally justified, or acquitted. Jesus paid the final penalty for our sin; there is no more to pay. Having been released from the power and guilt of sin, we now have good consciences and can stand before the throne of almighty God without fear.\n4. Finally, “we will also live with him [Christ] ”  (verse 8). What a tremendous promise! We will share His eternal resurrection life.\nHe died once to sin; He cannot die again. He lives forever to God, and we enter into that eternal life. ',
