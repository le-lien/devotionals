    "body": 'The Bible has been banned, burned, made fun of, and laughed at.\nScholars have called it foolish. Kings have made it illegal. A thousand times over the Bible has been declared dead, but somehow it never stays in the grave. Not only has it survived all these years, but it has also thrived. It is the single most popular book in all of history—the best-selling book in the world for years!\nThere is no way on earth to explain it, which is perhaps the only way to explain it. The answer for the Bible’s survival is not found on earth; it is found in heaven. The Bible is God’s book and God’s voice. It cannot be silenced.\nThe purpose of the Bible is to tell the world of God’s plan and His passion to save His children. That is the reason the Bible has survived for centuries. It is the treasure map that leads us to God’s greatest treasure—\neternal life with Him in heaven. ',
