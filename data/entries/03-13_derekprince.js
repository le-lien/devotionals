    "body": 'For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us [at the resurrection] . For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the sons of God.\n(Romans 8:18–19)\nMany Christians do not seem to grasp the significance of Christ’s resurrection for us. The sons of God are revealed at the resurrection; all of creation is waiting expectantly for it on tiptoe. The trees, seas, rivers, and mountains are all waiting. It is extraordinary that creation has so much excitement—and that much of the church has so little.\nFor the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it in hope; because the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.\n(verses 20–21)\nThe entirety of creation suffered because of man’s sin. Before man sinned, there were no thorns and thistles; nothing ever died or rotted.\nAnd we see that we’re not the only ones who are going to come into a glorious resurrection; creation is, too. However, God has assigned this priority: creation does not come in until we come in. As Paul wrote,\n“For we know that the whole creation groans and labors with birth pangs together until now” (verse 22).\nPaul often used the phrase “we know,” yet most contemporary Christians don’t know. Do we know that the whole creation is in labor pains, waiting for the revelation of the sons of God, the birth of a new age, and deliverance from corruption? ',
