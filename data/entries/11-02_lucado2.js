    "body": 'When God entered time and became a man, he who was boundless became bound. . . . For more than three decades, his once limitless reach would be limited to the stretch of an arm, his speed checked to the pace of human feet.\nI wonder, was he ever tempted to reclaim his boundlessness? … When the rain chilled his bones, was he tempted to change the weather? When the heat parched his lips, did he give thought to popping over to the Caribbean for some refreshment?\nIf ever he entertained such thoughts, he never gave in to them… . Not once did Christ use his supernatural powers for personal comfort. With one word he could’ve transformed the hard earth into a soft bed, but he didn’t.\nWith a wave of his hand, he could’ve boomeranged the spit of his accusers back into their faces, but he didn’t. With an arch of his brow, he could’ve paralyzed the hand of the soldier as he braided the crown of thorns. But he didn’t. ',
