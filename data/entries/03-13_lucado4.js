God also gives us what we need—a Savior.\nAnd that’s a good thing. For who would ever dare to say, “God, would You please take away all my sins and mistakes by hanging Yourself from a wooden cross?” Who would dare to add, “And after You forgive me, could You prepare a place in Your house for me to live forever?”\nAnd if that weren’t enough, would you have ever thought to ask, “God, would You please live in my heart and protect me and guide me and bless me with more than I could ever imagine or deserve?”\nHonestly, would we have the nerve to ask for that?\nJesus already knows the price of forgiving us. He already knows the cost of grace. But He gives us His grace anyway. ',
