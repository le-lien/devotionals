But even those people who have never heard of Jesus are given a message about God: “The heavens tell the glory of God” (Psalm 19:1).\nNature is God’s first missionary. Where there is no Bible, there are sparkling stars. If a person has nothing but nature, then nature is enough to tell him something about God. For “day after day [the heavens] tell the story… . They have no speech or words. They don’t make any sound to be heard. But their message goes out through all the world. It goes everywhere on earth” (Psalm 19:2–4).\nThe wonders of nature can cause those who don’t know God to wonder about their Creator. And God promises that those who search for Him with all their hearts will find Him (Jeremiah 29:13). ',

Look at the springtime flowers and thank God for His creativity. Feel the wind and thank God for His power. God’s messages are all around you—just open your eyes and see.'
