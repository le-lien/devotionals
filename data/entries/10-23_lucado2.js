So sleepy, he dozed in a storm-tossed boat.\nMost of all, he knows sin. Not his own, mind you. But he knows yours.\nEvery lie you’ve told.\nPerson you’ve hurt.\nPromise you’ve broken.\nEvery deed you’ve committed against God— for all sin is against God—\nJesus knows. He knows them better than you do. He knows their price.\nBecause he paid it. ',
