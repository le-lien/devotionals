It’s important to think about how you’ll react when this situation comes up. Before it comes up. Think about what you will say, and what your decision will be. Make your decision now.\nSex outside of marriage pretends we can give the body and not affect the soul. We can’t. All that we are as humans is so connected that whatever touches the body deeply impacts mind and heart as well. Get too close too soon and guilt and shame are the natural result. On top of that, there are the fears about pregnancy and disease. The me-centered phrase “as long as no one gets hurt” sounds noble, but the truth is, a lot of hurt can come from losing self-control with sexual temptation.\nGod created this wonderful gift, and he wants you to enjoy it—on his terms—within the covenant of marriage. Sex is a celebration of permanence, a tender moment in which the body continues what the mind and the soul have already begun. It’s a time when no one gets hurt. A time that brings joy to man and wife and honor to God. ',
