    "body": 'Jesus tells us … ,“When you pray, pray like this. ‘Our Father who is in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come.’”\nWhen you say, “Thy kingdom come,” you are inviting the Messiah himself to walk into your world. “Come, my King! Take your throne in our land. Be present in my heart. Be present in my office. Come into my marriage. Be Lord of my family, my fears, and my doubts.” This is no feeble request; it’s a bold appeal for God to occupy every corner of your life.\n[And] who are you to ask such a thing? Who are you to ask God to take control of your world? You are his child, for heaven’s sake! And so you ask boldly. ',
