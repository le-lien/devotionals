You honor God when you see them not as his failures, but as his projects.\nBesides, who assigned us the task of vengeance? God occupies the only seat on the supreme court of heaven. He wears the robe and refuses to share the gavel. Revenge removes God from the equation. We seek to displace and replace him. “Did you see what she did to me, Lord? I’m not sure you can handle this one. You may punish too little or too slowly. I’ll take this matter into my hands, thank you.”\nIs this what you want to say? Jesus didn’t. No one had a clearer sense of right and wrong than the perfect Son of God. Yet, “when he suffered, he didn’t make any threats but left everything to the one who judges fairly” (1\nPeter 2:23 GOD’S WORD).\nOnly God assesses accurate judgments. Vengeance is his job. Leave your enemies in the hands of the perfect Judge. ',
