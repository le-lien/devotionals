    "body": 'Let’s say a stress stirrer comes your way.\nThe doctor decides you need an operation. She detects a lump and thinks it best that you have it removed. So there you are, walking out of her office.\nYou’ve just been handed this cup of anxiety. What are you going to do with it? You can place it in one of two pots.\nYou can dump your bad news in the vat of worry and pull out the spoon.\nTurn on the fire. Stew on it. Stir it. Mope for a while. Brood for a time.\nWon’t be long before you’ll have a delightful pot of pessimism.\nHow about a different idea? The pot of prayer. Before the door of the doctor’s office closes, give the problem to God. “I receive your lordship.\nNothing comes to me that hasn’t passed through you.” In addition, stir in a healthy helping of gratitude.\nYour part is prayer and gratitude. God’s part? Peace and protection. ',
