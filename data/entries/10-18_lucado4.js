Instead, we keep trying to earn our way to heaven. Maybe we’re afraid to admit that we really can’t do it on our own. That we aren’t perfect. We would rather impress God with all the great things that we do instead of telling God how great He is. We make up extra rules and try extra hard. And we think that all of our hard work will make God smile.\nBut it doesn’t.\nGod’s smile is not for the one who brags that he did it all on his own.\nGod’s smile is for the one who brags that God did it all for him.
