    "body": 'No, you don’t know what you’ll face today, but your sovereign Savior does, and his mercies are new and formfitted for what you will face.\nThey are gloriously comforting words, the kinds of words that need to live fresh in the minds of all of God’s children this side of eternity. Listen to Hebrews 4:14–16:\nSince then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.\nConsider the hope that is built into these words:\n1. We have a High Priest.  If all this passage said were this, it would be amazing. The fact that Jesus sits now at the Father’s right hand and makes constant intercession for us is a redemptive miracle worthy of eternal celebration.\n2. Our High Priest sympathizes with our weaknesses.  But there is more. This High Priest is uniquely able to be touched by the weakness of our human condition. He is not cold or indifferent to our struggles in any way.\n3. We run to One who has been through what we’ve been through and more.  It is comforting to remember that this One is so easily touched by our struggles because he walked in our shoes. He willingly faced all that we face and more. He faced higher and deeper pressures than we do, but he never broke, whereas we all give in somewhere along the way.\n4. We can go to this One with confidence.  The result of all of this is that in our struggles with weakness within and temptation without, we have someone we can turn to with complete confidence and sure hope. He really does hold in his hands everything that we need.\n5. We can expect mercy that is formfitted for our particular needs.  Because of his grace, what can we expect? On the basis of his faithful presence and his reliable promises, we can expect mercies exactly right for what we are now\nfacing, and nothing less.\nWhen you struggle and are confronted with your weakness, say to yourself,\n“For this I have a reliable and understanding High Priest.”',
