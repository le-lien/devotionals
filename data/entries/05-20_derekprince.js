    "body": 'Those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified. What, then, shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all—how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?\n(Romans 8:29–32 niv)\nWhen we are identified with Jesus in His death, we enter into His abundant inheritance. We become heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus Christ. But there is a process. Five stages were outlined by Paul, all of which are in the past tense. The first two steps took place in eternity before time began: God foreknew us and predestined us.\nThen, God called  us through the preaching of the gospel. When we responded to the call, He then justified us. But He didn’t stop there; He also glorified us. He brought us up to share glory with Jesus in heaven as kings and priests. Not in the future, but in the past.\nSince, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God. When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.\n(Colossians 3:1–4 niv)\nWe already share Christ’s glory, but it is in the unseen, invisible world. Where Jesus is, we are.\nThank You, Jesus, for Your work on the cross. I proclaim that God foreknew me, predestined me, called me, justified me, and glorified me. Jesus bore my shame that I might share His glory. Amen.\nIdentification, Part 3 (audio)\n168\nDECLARING GOD’S WORD\nDeclaring God’s Word text_vNZ.indd 168\n4/09/2013 11:38:15 a.m.\nWEEK 21:\nJesus endured our\nrejection that we\nmight have His\nacceptance with\nthe Father.\nHaving predestined us to adoption as sons ',
