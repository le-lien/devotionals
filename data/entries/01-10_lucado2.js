She’s been adopted.\nHer adoptive parents are friends of mine. They brought her pictures, a teddy bear, granola bars, and cookies. Carinette shared the goodies and asked the director to guard her bear, but she keeps the pictures. They remind her of her home-to-be. Within a month, two at the most, she’ll be there. She knows the day is coming… . Any day now her father will appear. He came once to claim her. He’ll come again to carry her home. Till then she lives with a heart headed home.\nShouldn’t we all? Our Father paid us a visit too. Have we not been claimed? Adopted? … God searched you out. Before you knew you needed adopting, he’d already filed the papers and selected the wallpaper for your room.
