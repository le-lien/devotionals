    "body": 'implore you in the name of Jesus, especially those of you who are baptized, to wake up to the fact that you have pow-I er if God is with you. But there must be a resemblance between you and Jesus. The evil spirit said, “Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?”  Paul had the resemblance. You are not going to get this resemblance without having His presence; His presence changes you. You are not going to be able to get the results without the marks of the Lord Jesus. You must have the divine power within yourself; devils will take no notice of any power if they do not see Christ. “Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?”  The difference in these exorcists was that they did not have the marks of Christ, so the manifestation of the power of Christ was not seen.\n\nIf you want power, don‘t make any mistake about it. If you speak in tongues, don‘t mistake that for the power. If God has given you revelations along certain lines, don‘t mistake that for the power. Or if you have even laid hands on the sick and they have been healed, don‘t mistake that for the power. “The Spirit of the LORD is upon Me”  (Luke 4:18)—that alone is the power. Don‘t be deceived. There is a place to be reached where you know the Spirit is upon you so that you will be able to do the works that are accomplished by this blessed Spirit of God in you. Then the manifestation of His power will be seen, and people will believe in the Lord.\n\nGod wants you to be ministering spirits, and this means being clothed with another power. You know when this divine power is there, and you know when it goes forth. Beloved, we can reach it; it is a high mark, but we can get to it. Do you ask how? Say to God, “What do You want me to do?”  (Acts 9:6). That is the plan. It means a perfect surrender to the call of God, and perfect obedience.',
