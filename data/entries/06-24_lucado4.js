The street of the city was made of pure gold” (v. 21). “There is no night there” (v. 25). Now look at the words used to describe hell: it is a “lake of fire that burns with sulfur” (Revelation 19:20).\nThe fact is we all have to spend eternity somewhere—either heaven or hell. Seems like an easy choice to me! And when we choose to obey God, His mercy  saves us from hell, and His grace  blesses us with heaven.\nBut what about all the people who don’t know God? They’ll spend an eternity somewhere too. Knowing that should make us want to pray more. ',
