    "body": 'Here is a parable I told to a group of Maoris, who are great wood carvers, to illustrate the price Jesus paid to redeem us from our sins.\nThere was once a boy who carved a beautiful little wooden sailboat.\nOne day he took it down to the ocean to sail, but the wind changed and carried his boat out to sea. Since he could not recover his boat, he went home without it.\nThe next high tide brought the boat back again, and it was found by a man walking along the seashore. He inspected the boat and saw that it was beautifully made, so he sold it to a shopkeeper who cleaned it up and put it in his window, priced to sell.\nSome while later, the boy passed by the shop and saw his boat. He knew immediately that it was his, but he had no way to prove it. So, if he wanted it back, he knew he would have to buy it.\nHe set to work to earn the money by washing cars, mowing lawns, and other tasks. When he finally raised the necessary funds, he walked into the shop and bought back his boat. He took it in his hands, and, holding it to his breast, said, “Now you’re mine! I made you and I bought you.”\nPicture yourself as that boat. You may feel inadequate or worthless; you may wonder if God really cares. But the Lord is saying to you,\n“Now you’re doubly Mine—I made you and I bought you; you’re fully Mine.”\nThank You, Lord, for Your work in me. I proclaim that I am doubly the Lord’s because He made me and He bought me. ',
