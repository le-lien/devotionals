    "body": 'Can you imagine parents who want to adopt a child saying, “We’d like to adopt Johnny, but first we want to know a few things. Does he have a house to live in? Does he have money for college? Does he have a ride to school every morning and clothes to wear every day? Can he cook his own meals and wash his own clothes?”\nNo adoption agency would listen to such talk. The agent would hold up her hand and say, “Wait a minute. You don’t understand. You don’t adopt Johnny because of what he has. You adopt him because of what he needs.\nHe needs a home.”\nThe same is true with God. He doesn’t give you His name because of your great sense of humor or your talents or your money. He doesn’t adopt you because of what you have. He adopts you because of what you need— ',
