Not when you’re positive, pumped up, and ready to tackle world hunger. Not then. You know how he feels about you then. Even you like you then.\nYou want to know how he feels about you when you snap at anything that moves, when your thoughts are gutter-level, when your tongue is sharp enough to slice a rock. How does he feel about you then?\nCan anything separate us from the love Christ has for us?\nGod answered our question before we asked it. So we’d see his answer, he lit the sky with a star. So we’d hear it, he filled the night with a choir. So we’d believe it, he did what no man had ever dreamed. He became flesh and came to live among us. He placed his hand on the shoulder of humanity and said, “You’re something special.” ',
