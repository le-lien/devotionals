We love to be with the ones we love.\nThe four-year-old running up the sidewalk into the arms of Grandpa. The bowl of cereal with Mom before the rest of the house awakens. That moment when, for a moment, everyone is quiet as we hold hands around the table and thank God for family and friends and pumpkin pie. We love to be with the ones we love.\nMay I remind you? So does God. He loves to be with the ones he loves.\nHow else do you explain what he did? Between him and us there was a distance—a great span. And he couldn’t bear it. He couldn’t stand it. So he did something about it.\n“He gave up his place with God and made himself nothing.” ',
