Who knows how many prayers are being answered right now because of the faithful ponderings of a parent ten or twenty years ago?\nGod listens to thoughtful parents.\nPraying for our children is a noble task. If what we are doing, in this fast-paced society, is taking us away from prayer time for our children, we’re doing too much. There is nothing more special, more precious than time that a parent spends struggling and pondering with God on behalf of a child. ',
