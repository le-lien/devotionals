    "body": 'I’ve tried to be a friend to a new kid in our school. He’s from another culture, and most of the kids in school treat him like dirt. Now they’re making fun of me for being friends with him. This really hurts, but I feel sorry for him.\nI’m his only friend right now. What should I do?”\nHere’s how I answered this question from a student: “I would remain a friend to the new kid no matter what is said. The new kid is an unknown, but you are making him known. The first few jokes always sting, but over time the prejudice fades, the jokes get old, and people see that their mockery won’t make a difference. Others look only at the surface and see differences. You obviously look deeper into this friend and see similarities.”\nHeaven is not divided into neighborhoods. Iranians over here. Peruvians here. Popular crowd in the middle. Rejects in the corner. In fact, when the colors of heaven are mentioned, they are always expressed as a rainbow (Revelation 4:3; 10:1). In heaven, no one eats alone. ',
