    "body": 'In this verse lies a test for love.\nHere’s an example. A classic one. A young couple are on a date. His affection goes beyond her comfort zone. She resists. But he tries to persuade her with the oldest line in the book: “But I love you. I just want to be near you. If you loved me …”\nThat siren you hear? It’s the phony-love detector. This guy doesn’t love her… . He may love her body. He may love boasting to his buddies about his conquest. But he doesn’t love her. True love will never ask the\n“beloved” to do what he or she thinks is wrong… .\nDo you want to know if your love for someone is true? If your friendship is genuine? … Ask yourself: Do I influence this person to do what is right? ',
