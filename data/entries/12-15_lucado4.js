A friend betrayed you.\nAnd you are angry.\nOr maybe you were hurt just last week. The friend who owes you money just bought a new skateboard. Or you’re the only one not invited to the party. And you are hurt.\nPart of you is broken inside, and the other part is mad. Part of you wants to cry, and part of you wants to fight. It’s like there’s a fire burning in your heart. It’s the fire of anger.\nAnd you have to decide: Do I put the fire out or heat it up? Do I get over it or get even? Do I let my hurts heal, or do I let hurt turn into hate? ',
