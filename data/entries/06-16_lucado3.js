Do you have poor I-sight?\nRemember that your identity isn’t about what you do but who you are.\nYou’re a child of God, created by the Master for his plans and glory. When you see yourself through his lens, your “I can’t do anything” turns into “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me” (Philippians 4:13). God is bigger than your shyness, your fears of rejection, your past failures. He wants you to reach out to others in his name. You may not see it yet, but he is preparing you to change the world.\nTo fully belong to God means to throw away feelings of insecurity. You are part of his family, forged to play a role in a holy future—and he does not make mistakes. ',
