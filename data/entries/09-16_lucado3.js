    "body": 'Jesus had business to do with bullies. So do we.When a group of finger-pointing Pharisees\nWhen a group of finger-pointing Pharisees pushed a woman accused of adultery in front of Jesus, he lifted himself until his shoulders were straight and his head was high. He stood, not to preach, for his words would be few.\nNot to instruct his followers; he didn’t address them. He stood on behalf of the woman. He placed himself between her and the lynch mob and said, “Let the one who has never sinned throw the first stone!” (John 8:7 NLT).\nWe also should stand up for those who can’t defend themselves, should\n“encourage the disheartened, help the weak” (1 Thessalonians 5:14 NIV).\nDoes someone in your school or neighborhood need your help? Turn the other cheek doesn’t mean turn away when a bully threatens—with words or fists—a smaller, younger, or weaker victim. Jesus showed us the way. So step forward. Love stands up to bullies. ',
