    "body": 'More than once I’ve heard people refer to the story [of Ananias and Sapphira] with a nervous chuckle and say, “I’m glad God doesn’t still strike people dead for lying.” I’m not so sure he doesn’t. It seems to me that the wages of deceit is still death. Not death of the body, perhaps, but the death of:\na marriage—Falsehoods are termites in the trunk of the family tree.\na conscience—The tragedy of the second lie is that it is always easier to tell than the first.\na career—Just ask the student who got booted out for cheating or the employee who got fired for embezzlement if the lie wasn’t fatal… .\nWe could also list the deaths of intimacy, trust, peace, credibility, and self-respect. But perhaps the most tragic death that occurs from deceit is our\n[Christian] witness. The court won’t listen to the testimony of a perjured witness. Neither will the world. ',
