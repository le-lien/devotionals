You added this and changed that until it looked like you  lived there.\nWell, God loves to decorate too. Actually, God has  to decorate. Let Him live long enough in a heart, and that heart will begin to change. He’ll move some forgiveness into that corner. He’ll add some shelves and fill them up with His Word. It’s not always pleasant though. You might feel a little uncomfortable when He knocks down that wall of jealousy or anger, but that new spirit of kindness He puts in will look and feel great. Then He’ll paint your whole heart with love—love for Him and love for others. ',
