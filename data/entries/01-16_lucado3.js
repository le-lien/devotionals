    "body": 'My friend Rob cried freely as he told the story about his young son’s challenging life. Daniel was born with a double cleft palate, dramatically disfiguring his face. He had surgery, but the evidence remains, so people constantly notice the difference and occasionally make remarks.\nDaniel, however, is unfazed. He just tells people that God made him this way, so what’s the big deal? He was named student of the week at school and was asked to bring something to show his classmates for show-and-tell.\nDaniel told his mom that he wanted to take the pictures that showed his face prior to the surgery. His mom was concerned. “Won’t that make you feel a bit funny?” she asked.\nBut Daniel insisted. “Oh no, I want everyone to see what God did for me!”\nTry Daniel’s defiant joy and see what happens. God has handed you a cup of blessings. I suggest you sweeten it with a heaping spoonful of gratitude. ',

      "text": 'You could say that being happy is the temporary good feeling that comes from eating ice cream or finishing first in a race. Joy, however, is something deeper. It defies bad days and hard lives. No matter what the circumstances, it lets the love and light of God shine through.'
