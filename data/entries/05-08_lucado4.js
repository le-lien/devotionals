We make fun of the girl with the limp, but we cannot see the rock in her shoe.\nIs someone too loud? Maybe he is afraid of being ignored again. Is someone else scared? Maybe she is afraid of failing again. Are others moving too slowly? Maybe they fell the last time they ran. We don’t know.\nOnly the One who is always watching them can know.\nNot only do we not know about their yesterdays, but we don’t know about their tomorrows either. We must leave the judging to God. Our job is to “love each other” and to “be kind and humble” to each other (1 Peter 3:8). Remember, “God began doing a good work in you. And he will continue it until it is finished when Jesus Christ comes again” (Philippians 1:6). God’s not finished with you—or them—yet! ',
