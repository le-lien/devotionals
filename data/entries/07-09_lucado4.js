It’s a life free of the shame of past mistakes and a life full of the hope of heaven.\nDoes that mean that your old, sinful side will never show its ugly head again? Or that you’ll never be tempted to do wrong again?\nTo answer that question, compare your new birth in Jesus to a newborn baby. Can a baby walk? Or feed himself? Or sing or read or speak? No, but someday he will. ',

Is the mom embarrassed that the baby can’t spell … or walk … or stand up and give a speech? Of course not. The parents aren’t ashamed; they are proud. They know the baby will grow and learn with time. God knows you will grow and learn too.',
      "text": 'Growing in Grace Look back through your baby pictures. See how much you’ve changed, grown, and learned? Your parents didn’t toss you out of the house when you stumbled as a toddler. God won’t either. He’ll lift you up, dust you off, and help you take the next step.'
