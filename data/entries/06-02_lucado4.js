    "body": 'Abranch is connected to a vine. One is a part of the other. It’s impossible to tell where the branch starts and the vine ends.\nThe branch isn’t connected to the vine only when it bears fruit. The gardener doesn’t keep the branches in a box and then—on the day he wants grapes—run out and glue the branches to the vine. No, the branch lives on the vine and gets its strength from the vine.\nThat’s the kind of relationship God wants with you. God doesn’t want you to turn to Him only when you need something or when something is wrong. God wants your thoughts and your heart to be with Him always.\nIf a branch is cut off the vine, it begins to dry up. It has lost the source of its life. In the same way, when you are cut off from God, your heart begins to dry up. You have lost the source of your life.\nStay connected to the vine—to God—and He will keep you strong. ',
