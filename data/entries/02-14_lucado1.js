    "body": 'What an incredible sentence. God will praise each one of them.  Not\n“the best of them” nor “a few of them” nor “the achievers among them,” but\n“God will praise each one of them.”\nYou won’t be left out. God will see to that. In fact, God himself will give the praise. When it comes to giving recognition, God does not delegate the job. Michael doesn’t hand out the crowns. Gabriel doesn’t speak on behalf of the throne. God himself does the honors. God himself will praise his children.\nAnd what’s more, the praise is personal! … Awards aren’t given a nation at a time, a church at a time, or a generation at a time. The crowns are given one at a time. God himself will look you in the eye and bless you with the words, “Well done, good and faithful servant!” (Matt. 25:23 NIV). ',
