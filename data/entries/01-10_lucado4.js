How sad it would be if you settled for earth when the joy of heaven is waiting.\nYou won’t ever feel completely happy and at home here on earth. You’re not supposed to. It is not your home. First Peter 2:11 says, “You are like visitors and strangers in this world.”\nYou see, God didn’t make you for earth. He made you for heaven. Oh yes, you will have some happy times on earth. You will have times of joy.\nYou will catch glimpses of God’s light. You will laugh and love and be loved. But those happy times are just a taste of what heaven will be like. ',
