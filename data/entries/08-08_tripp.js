    "body": 'I remember my brother Tedd saying it to me, but I didn’t realize how right he was: “Obedience is its own reward.” It is hard to overestimate the grace that motivates each act of obedience in your life and in mine: Sinners tend not to esteem authority.\nSinners like to write their own rules.\nSinners are good at convincing themselves that their wrongs are not that wrong.\nSinners tend to believe in their own autonomy.\nSinners tend to think they’re wiser than they are.\nSinners tend to have a moral code that is formed more by their desires than by God’s law.\nSinners tend to think that they don’t need what they don’t desire.\nSinners tend to be self-focused and self-excusing.\nSinners tend to crave what God has prohibited.\nSinners tend to opt for short-term pleasure over long-term gain.\nSinners tend to rebel rather than submit.\nBecause all of the above statements are true, it is a miracle of amazing grace that any of us ever chooses to obey God. It is even more a miracle that we can find joy in obeying someone whom we cannot see, hear, or touch. It is a wonder of transforming grace that the heart of a self-focused human being can abandon the pursuit of his own little kingdom and give itself to serve the purposes of the kingdom of another. Any time we desire, in word, thought, or action, to do what pleases God, we are being rescued, transformed, and empowered by his grace.\nYou see, your obedience celebrates grace even in moments when you aren’t consciously celebrating it yourself. Each moment of submission to the will of God celebrates this reality: “For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace” (Rom. 6:14).\nSo smile when you obey; you are experiencing the riches of grace. Give thanks when you submit; you are being rescued by grace. Celebrate when you make the right choice; you are being transformed by grace. Sing for joy when you serve God’s purposes; you have just given evidence of the presence of redeeming grace!',
