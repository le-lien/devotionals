    "body": 'For You formed my inward parts; You covered me in my mother’s womb. I will praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; marvelous are Your works, and that my soul knows very well. My frame was not hidden from You, when I was made in secret, and skillfully wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.\n(Psalm 139:13–15)\nWhen I consider the physical body, I am filled with a sense of awe.\nThe substance that eventually became my body was planned and formed by God in the earth long before it ever entered my body. God had appointed the substance that would one day constitute my body.\nYour eyes saw my substance, being yet unformed. And in Your book they [“my members” kjv]  all were written, the days fashioned for me, when as yet there were none of them.\n(verse 16) ',

      "text": 'God had a blueprint for our bodies before they ever came into being. Compare this verse to what Jesus said in Luke 12:7:  “But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not fear therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.”  This statement shows the depth of God’s concern for our physical bodies—He has even numbered the hairs on our heads. When we realise this, we must acknowledge that God also has a purpose for this marvelous workmanship, which is revealed in 1 Corinthians 6:19–20: “Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s.”'
