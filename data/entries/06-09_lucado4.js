    "body": 'H ow could a loving God punish people for all eternity?  People often ask that question. But we need to get a couple of things straight.\nFirst, God  does not choose to punish people. God tells us what will happen if we do not obey His Word, and then He lets us  choose. If we choose not to follow His Word, then we choose to be punished. But if we choose to obey His Word, then He rewards us with heaven. The choice is ours. God simply respects our choice.\nSecond, God does not punish people. God punishes sinners. He punishes those who have chosen to do wrong and disobey Him.\nAnd, last, no one has  to be punished. God offers a way for everyone to get to heaven. All we have to do is believe in His Son and obey His Word.\nBut God won’t force us to believe—it has to be our choice.\nGrowing in Grace\nWaiting until you have to choose makes it harder to make the right decision.
