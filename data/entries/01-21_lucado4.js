You may be grumpy right now. But you don’t have to live in “Grumpsville”\nforever. You are fixable. And just because you’re selfish today, that doesn’t mean you have to be selfish for your whole life.\nWho said you can’t change your heart? And why do people say things like “I have a bad temper. That’s just the way I am”? Would you say that if something were wrong with your body? “I have a broken leg. That’s just the way I am.” Of course not! You would get help.\nSo can you get help for your selfishness or your grumpiness? Of course you can! Jesus can change your heart. He will help you have a heart just like His. ',
