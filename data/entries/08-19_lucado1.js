You’ve stepped away from the masses and followed the Master as he led you up the winding path to the summit… .\nGently your guide invites you to sit on the rock above the tree line and look out with him at the ancient peaks that will never erode. “What is necessary is still what is sure,” he confides. “Just remember:\n“You’ll go nowhere tomorrow that I haven’t already been.\n“Truth will still triumph… .\n“The victory is yours… .”\nThe sacred summit. A place of permanence in a world of transition. ',
