As Jesus, He came into a world filled with problems and sadness. “The Word became a man and lived among us.\n… The Word was full of grace and truth” (John 1:14).\nThe important word in this verse is among. He lived “among  us.” Jesus stepped down out of heaven and into the body of a tiny baby. He made His throne out of a manger and His royal court out of some cows. He took a common name— Jesus (which back then was as ordinary as the name John today)—and made it holy. He took common people and gave them His holiness. He became a friend of the sinner and a brother of the poor. ',
