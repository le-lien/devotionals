    "body": 'Jesus’ obedience began in a small town carpentry shop. His uncommon approach to his common life groomed him for his uncommon call. “When Jesus entered public life he was about thirty years old” (Luke 3:23 MSG)…\n. In order for Jesus to change the world, he had to say good-bye to his world.\nHe had to give Mary a kiss. Have a final meal in the kitchen, a final walk through the streets. Did he ascend one of the hills of Nazareth and think of the day he would ascend the hill near Jerusalem?\nHe knew what was going to happen. “God chose him for this purpose long before the world began” (1 Pet. 1:20 NLT). Every ounce of suffering had been scripted—it just fell to him to play the part.\nNot that he had to. Nazareth was a cozy town. Why not build a carpentry business? Keep his identity a secret? … To be forced to die is one thing, but to willingly take up your own cross is something else. ',
