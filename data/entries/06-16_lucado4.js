Not our strength.\nLike Paul on the road to Damascus, we need to know two things: we are great sinners, and we need a great savior.\nAnd like Peter when he stepped out of the boat and onto the stormy water, we need to know two facts: we are going down, and Jesus is still standing up. There is nothing we can do to save ourselves. We need to reach out for Jesus’ hand and hold on to His grace that saves us.\nGrace is when God steps in and fills our stormy lives with His peaceful presence. We hear His voice, saying, “Don’t be afraid. It is I” (John 6:20).\nHe wants us to let go of all our past mistakes, all our worries and fears, and hold on to Him. ',
