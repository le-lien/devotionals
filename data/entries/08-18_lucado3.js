    "body": 'Philip had just agreed to become a disciple. He found Nathaniel and told him they’d found the One whom Moses wrote about, the One the prophets spoke of. Of all people, it was Jesus, Joseph’s son, the man who’d grown up in Nazareth. Nathaniel couldn’t believe anyone so important could come from such an out-of-the-way, out-of-touch little town. “‘Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?’ Nathaniel asked. ‘Come and see,’ said Philip” (John 1:46 NIV).\nNathaniel’s question still lingers, even two thousand years later. Can anything good come out of Nazareth? Come and see the changed lives. The delinquent who is now the do-gooder. The angry, bitter soul who is now full of joy. The depressed and overwhelmed who are now hopeful.\nCome and see the pierced hand of God touch the most common heart, wipe the tear from the saddest face, and forgive the ugliest sin. Come and see.\nHe avoids no seeker. He ignores no probe. He fears no search. Come and see what One from Nazareth can do. ',
