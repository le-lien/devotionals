Do you see what God is doing? Shaping you “along the same lines as the life of his Son.”\nJesus felt no guilt; God wants you to feel no guilt.\nJesus had no bad habits; God wants to do away with yours.\nJesus faced fears with courage; God wants you to do the same.\nJesus knew the difference between right and wrong; God wants us to know the same.\nJesus served others and gave his life for the lost; we can do likewise.\nJesus dealt with anxiety about death; you can too.\nGod’s desire, his plan, his ultimate goal is to make you into the image of Christ.
