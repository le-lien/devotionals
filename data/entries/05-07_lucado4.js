Or the kid who sneaks into the scary movie on Saturday afternoon, knowing he’s going to church on Sunday morning.\nIt’s easy to say, “I’m going to do whatever I want, because God will forgive me anyway.”\nBut is that the purpose of grace? Of God’s forgiveness? Did God give up His Son just so that we could get away with disobeying Him? Nope. The Bible tells us that “God’s grace … teaches us not to live against God and not to do the evil things the world wants to do. That grace teaches us to live on earth now in a wise and right way” (Titus 2:11–12).\nGod’s grace washes away all our selfish and sinful mistakes. Once we are clean, why would we want to go back to being dirty? ',

Do you want to go back to the mud? No! But God says that’s just what we do when we go back to sinful ways (2 Peter 2:20–22).'
