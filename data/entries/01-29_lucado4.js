    "body": 'The heart of Jesus was pure. The Savior was adored by thousands, yet He was happy to live a simple life. He was surrounded by sinners and servants, yet He never looked down on them. The people He created wanted to kill Him, but He forgave them before they even asked.\nListen to those who knew Him best. Peter traveled with Jesus for three and a half years. He described Jesus as a “pure and perfect lamb” (1 Peter 1:19). John spent the same amount of time with Jesus. He said, “There is no sin in Christ” (1 John 3:5).\nJesus’ heart was peaceful. The disciples worried over how to feed the thousands of people, but not Jesus. He thanked God for the problem. The disciples shouted with fear in the storm, but not Jesus. He slept through it. ',

How would it feel to carry that rock around all the time? Exhausting! Now imagine your heart filled with love and peace—like air in a balloon. You’ll “float” through your day!'
