Pay a visit to His home address:\n1 Billion Starry Sky Avenue\nGod is not just big; He is perfect and all-powerful. He is not touched by even a hint of sin, not limited by the time line of history, not weakened by the tiredness of a body.\nWhat controls you doesn’t control God. What troubles you doesn’t trouble Him. What tires you doesn’t tire Him. Is an eagle bothered by a bump in the road? No, he rises above it. Is the whale troubled by the hurricane? Of course not! He dives beneath it. Is the lion irritated by the mouse standing in his way? No, he steps over it. ',
