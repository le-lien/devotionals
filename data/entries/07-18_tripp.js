    "body": 'The Bible never denies reality. The Bible never plays it safe. The Bible never offers you a cosmetized view of the fallen world. The Bible never tricks you into thinking that things are better than they are. The Bible is straightforward and honest but not void of hope. While it is very candid about the hardships of life in this broken world, the Bible is also gloriously hopeful. The honesty does not crush the hope, but neither does the hope negate the honesty. Psalm 28 is a good example of the important harmony of these two themes:\nTo you, O LORD, I call; my rock, be not deaf to me,\nlest, if you be silent to me,\nI become like those who go down to the pit.\nHear the voice of my pleas for mercy, when I cry to you for help, when I lift up my hands\ntoward your most holy sanctuary.\nDo not drag me off with the wicked,\nwith the workers of evil,\nwho speak peace with their neighbors\nwhile evil is in their hearts.\nGive to them according to their work\nand according to the evil of their deeds; give to them according to the work of their hands; render them their due reward.\nBecause they do not regard the works of the LORD\nor the work of his hands,\nhe will tear them down and build them up no more.\nBlessed be the LORD!\nFor he has heard the voice of my pleas for mercy.\nThe LORD is my strength and my shield; in him my heart trusts, and I am helped; my heart exults, and with my song I give thanks to him.\nThe LORD is the strength of his people; he is the saving refuge of his anointed.\nOh, save your people and bless your heritage!\nBe their shepherd and carry them forever.”\nThis psalm of trouble ends up being a psalm of shining hope. That’s the story\nof the life of every believer, because you and I are never alone in our trouble.\nThe “saving refuge” is always with us!',
