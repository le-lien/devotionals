    "body": 'One of the incredible abilities of Jesus was to stay on target. His life never got off track. As Jesus looked across the horizon of his future, he could see many targets. Many flags were flapping in the wind, each of which he could have pursued. He could have been a political revolutionary. He could have been content to be a teacher and educate minds. But in the end he chose to be a Savior and save souls.\nAnyone near Christ for any length of time heard it from Jesus himself.\n“The Son of Man came to find lost people and save them” (Luke 19:10 NCV).\nThe heart of Christ was relentlessly focused on one task. The day he left the carpentry shop of Nazareth he had one ultimate aim—the cross of Calvary.\nYou have a single task too. It’s a response to the one Jesus chose. He called your task the first and greatest commandment: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind”\n(Matthew 22:37 NIV).\nAre you on target? ',
