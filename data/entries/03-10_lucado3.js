    "body": 'To what can we compare God? Any pursuit of God’s counterpart is vain.\nAny search for a godlike person or position on earth is futile. No one and nothing compares with him. No one advises him. No one helps him. It is he who “executes judgment, putting down one and lifting up another” (Psalm 75:7 ESV).\nYou and I may have power. But God is power. We may be lightning bugs, but he is lightning itself. Consider the universe around us. Unlike the potter who takes something and reshapes it, God took nothing and created something. God created everything that exists out of nothing. Prior to creation, the universe was not a dark space. The universe did not exist. God even created the darkness. “I create the light and make the darkness” (Isaiah 45:7 NLT).\nEven God asks, “To whom will you compare me? Who is my equal?”\n(Isaiah 40:25 NLT). As if his question needed an answer, he gives one: “I alone am God! I am God, and there is none like me” (46:9 NLT). ',
