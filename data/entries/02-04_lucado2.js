Could you use a reminder on how to slow it all down?\nIf so, read what Jesus did during the last Sabbath of his life. Start in the Gospel of Matthew. Didn’t find anything? Try Mark. Read what Mark recorded about the way Jesus spent the Sabbath. Nothing there either?\nStrange. What about Luke? What does Luke say? Not a reference to the day? Not a word about it? Well, try John. Surely John mentions the Sabbath. He doesn’t? No reference? Hmmmm. Looks like Jesus was quiet that day.\n“Wait a minute. That’s it?” That’s it.\n“You mean with one week left to live, Jesus observed the Sabbath?” As far as we can tell.\n“You mean with all those apostles to train and people to teach, he took a day to rest and worship?” Apparently so.
