    "body": 'Rejection, simply defined, is the sense of being unwanted or the sense that, although you want people to love you, no one does. Or it can be the desire to belong to a group from which you feel excluded—\nit seems you’re always on the outside looking in. One reason that so many people today suffer from the problem of rejection is the form of our society and its pressures, particularly those causing the breakup of family life.\nWhat is the opposite of rejection? It is acceptance. I love the last part of Ephesians 1:6, which says, “He [God] has made us accepted in the Beloved.”  Jesus, God’s true and only begotten Son, was rejected so that we, who were unworthy rebels, might have His acceptance with the Father. The surest remedy for our problems is to believe that Jesus bore our rejection that we might have His acceptance with the Father.\nGod’s family is the best family. There is none equal to it. Even if your own family did not care for you—perhaps your father rejected you or your mother never had time for you—God still wants you.\nYou are accepted. You are the object of His special care and affection.\nEverything He does in the universe revolves around you.\nWhen God says that we are accepted, He does not mean that we are merely tolerated. We never take too much of His time. The only thing that upsets Him is when we stay away too long. He does not push us off into a corner and say, “Wait. I’m too busy. I don’t have time for you.”\nRather, He says, “I’m interested in you. I want you. You’re welcome.\nCome in. I’ve been waiting a long time for you.”\nThank You, Jesus, for Your work on the cross. I proclaim that ',
