Some time ago my daughter Andrea got a splinter in her finger. I took her to get the first aid kit. I set out some tweezers, ointment, and a Band-Aid.\nShe didn’t like what she saw. “I just want the Band-Aid, Daddy.”\nSometimes we are just like Andrea. We come to Jesus with our sins, but all we want is for them to be covered up. We want to skip the treatment. We want to hide our sin. And one has to wonder if God—even in His great mercy—will heal what we just try to hide. ',
