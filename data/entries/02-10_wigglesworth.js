    "body": 'ne day a stylishly dressed lady came to our meeting and on up to the platform. Under her arm, going down underneath O her dress, was a crutch that nobody could see. She had been helpless in one leg for twenty years, had heard of what God was doing, and wanted to be prayed for. As soon as we prayed for her, she exclaimed, "What have you done with my leg?" Three times she said it, and then we saw that the crutch was loose and hanging and that she was standing straight up.\n\nThe lady who was interpreting for me said to her, "We have done nothing with your leg. If anything has been done, it is God who has done it."\n\nShe answered, "I have been lame and used a crutch for twenty years, but my leg is perfect now." We did not suggest that she kneel at the altar and thank God; she fell down among the others and cried for mercy. I find that when God touches us, it is a divine touch of life and power; it thrills and quickens the body so that people know it is God. Then conviction comes, and they cry for mercy.\n\nGod heals by the power of His Word. But the most important thing is, Are you saved? Do you know the Lord? Are you prepared to meet God? You may be an invalid as long as you live, but you may be saved by the power of God. You may have a strong, healthy body but may go straight to hell because you know nothing of the grace of God and salvation. Thank God I was saved in a moment, the moment I believed, and God will do the same for you.\n\nGod means by this divine power within you to make you follow after the mind of the Spirit by the Word of God until you are entirely changed by the power of it. You might say, "Wigglesworth, is there anything you can look up to God and ask Him for in your body?" I will say now that I have a body in perfect condition and have nothing to ask for, and I am sixty-five. It was not always so. This body was a frail, helpless body, but God fulfilled His Word to 77\n\nme: He took my infirmities and my sicknesses, and by His stripes I am healed (Matt. 8:17; Isa. 53:5).\n\nIt is wonderful to go here and there and not even notice that you have a body because it is not a hindrance to you. He took our infirmities. He bore our sickness; He came to heal our brokenheartedness. Jesus wants us to come forth in divine likeness, in resurrection force, in the power of the Spirit, to walk in faith and understand His Word. That is what He meant when He said He would give us power over all the power of the Enemy. He will subdue all things until everything comes into perfect harmony with His will. Is He reigning over your affections, desires, and will? If so, when He reigns, you will be subject to His reigning power. He will be the authority over the whole situation. When He reigns, everything must be subservient to His divine plan and will for us.\n\nSee what the Word of God says, “No one can say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit”  (1 Cor. 12:3). “Lord!”  Bless God forever. Oh, for Him to be Lord and Master! For Him to rule and control! For Him to be filling your whole body with the plan of truth! Because you are in Christ Jesus, all things are subject to Him. It is lovely, and God wants to make it so to you. When you get there, you will find divine power continually working. I absolutely believe that no person comes into the place of revelation and activity of the gifts of the Spirit except by this fulfilled promise of Jesus that He will baptize us in the Holy Spirit.',
