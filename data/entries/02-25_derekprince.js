    "body": 'All has been settled by the blood of Jesus!\nThe first time we make this declaration, Satan will laugh at us. We need to keep  saying it. Satan is the tempter, but he is very methodical and wastes no time. He will tempt you as long as he gets any response from you. When there is no more response, he won’t bother to tempt you. So, we can be tempted in the area of, let’s say, resentment. We must keep saying, “It was crucified. It has no power in me. It has no place in me.” The devil says, “That isn’t really true. That’s just something Brother Prince said.” But we keep saying it. And after a while, it becomes so real that the devil doesn’t waste his time trying to tempt us any longer.\nOne of the things we have to do is build the walls of our character.\nThe Bible says that the person who has no control over his own spirit is like a city that is broken-down and without walls. (See Proverbs 25:28.) In our culture today, many people are growing up like broken-down walls because of bad homes, drugs, or evil influences. Anybody who has been deep in drugs is definitely a city without protective walls. We build the walls by strengthening our wills and asserting our rights bought by the cross. We may think of this process as a terrible experience. But we don’t realise how much good it is doing us; at the end of it, we have built strong character. Gifts are temporary, for this life only; character is permanent—it goes into eternity with us. God is infinitely more interested in your character than in your gifts.\nThank You, Lord, for the blood of Jesus. I proclaim that I intend to strengthen my will and assert my rights bought by the cross, declaring over and over again: Satan has no place in me, no power over me, no unsettled claims against me. All has been settled by the blood of Jesus! Amen.\nThe Fullness of the Cross, Vol.3: Deliverance from the Fleshly Nature (audio) 72\nDECLARING GOD’S WORD\nDeclaring God’s Word text_vNZ.indd 72\n4/09/2013 11:38:05 a.m.\nWEEK 9:\nMy body is a temple\nfor the Holy Spirit,\nredeemed, cleansed,\nand sanctified by the\nblood of Jesus.\nOr do you not know that your body is the\ntemple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, ',
