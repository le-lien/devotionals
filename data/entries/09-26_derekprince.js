    "body": 'Let’s look for a moment at something the Bible says about the material out of which the human body is made. Some of you probably do not know that the Bible has quite a lot to say about that.\nIt always grieves me when Christians downgrade their own bodies and talk about them as if they were inferior or of little importance.\nBrothers and sisters, our bodies are miracles. If your car was totaled in a wreck and you had to replace it, all you would need is a certain amount of dollars and you could purchase a new car. But if you injure even one eye, there is no way you can pay for a new eye. It is priceless.\nSo it is with every other major organ of the body. It grieves me when I see Christians taking more care of their cars than they do of their bodies. That is a very foolish scale of values.\nPsalm 139 is a psalm that David wrote as a meditation on the marvels of his own body. David said to the Lord, I will praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; marvelous are Your works, and that my soul knows very well.\n(Psalm 139:14)\nDavid was talking about his physical body. I wonder if you would agree to say those same words about your own body. It would change the attitude of some of you. Some Christians are almost burdened down with their bodies. They seem to wish that they did not have the problem of a body. That is a false viewpoint. Say these words aloud right now: “I will praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.” ',
