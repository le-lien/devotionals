    "body": 'In spiritual relationship we do not grow step by step; we are either there or we are not. God does not cleanse us more and more from sin, but when we are in the light, walking in the light, we are cleansed from all sin. It is a question of obedience, and instantly the relationship is perfected. Turn away for one second out of obedience, and darkness and death are at work at once.\nAll God’s revelations are sealed until they are opened to us by obedience. You will never get them open by philosophy or thinking.\nImmediately you obey, a flash of light comes. Let God’s truth work\nin you by soaking in it, not by worrying into it. The only way you can get to know is to stop trying to find out and by being born again.\nObey God in the thing He shows you, and instantly the next thing is opened up. One reads tomes on the work of the Holy Spirit, when one five minutes of drastic obedience would make things as clear as a sunbeam. “I suppose I shall understand these things some day!”\nYou can understand them now. It is not study that does it, but obedience. The tiniest fragment of obedience, and heaven opens and the profoundest truths of God are yours straight away. God will never reveal more truth about Himself until you have obeyed what you know already. Beware of becoming “wise and prudent.” ',
