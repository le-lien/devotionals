    "body": 'Nothing brings on fear like being oblivious to mercy. If you haven’t accepted God’s forgiveness, you are doomed to fear. Nothing can deliver you from the gnawing realization that you have disregarded your Maker and disobeyed his instruction. No pill, pep talk, or possession can set the sinner’s heart at ease. You may deaden the fear, but you can’t remove it. Only God’s grace can.\nHave you accepted the forgiveness of Christ? If not, do so. “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9). Your prayer can be as simple as this: Dear Father, I need forgiveness. I admit that I have turned away from you. Please forgive me. I place my soul in your hands and my trust in your grace. Through Jesus I pray, amen.\nHaving received God’s forgiveness, live forgiven! When Jesus sets you free, you are free indeed. ',

      "text": 'What does it mean to be set free by Jesus? What does it mean to live forgiven? It’s knowing that you’ve admitted your mistakes to God. It’s leaving fear and guilt behind. It’s finding peace in his plan. It’s trusting him and talking and living truth each day.'
