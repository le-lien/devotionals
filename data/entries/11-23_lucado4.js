For people like that, doing their best is all about being number one.\nDon’t get me wrong. God wants you do your best. This world needs people who try hard. People who take pride in their work. God wants you to use the gifts and talents that He has given you in a way that pleases—and praises—Him. If you’re an A+ student, use your gifts to help others learn. If you’re a great third baseman, show others how to be a good sport by the way you win and  lose. If you’re a fabulous artist, use your art to remind people of the beauty of God all around them. ',
