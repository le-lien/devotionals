    "body": 'Aservant owed more money to his king than he could ever repay. He’d sooner find an iPod in his cereal than cash for the debt. So the king ordered that he, his family, and everything he had be sold to pay the debt. But the man begged, “‘Please, be patient with me, and I will pay it all.’ Then his master was filled with pity for him, and he released him and forgave his debt”\n(Matthew 18:25–27 NLT).\nThe man hurried to the house of a person who owed him a few dollars.\nYou would expect the just-blessed man to be quick-to-bless, right? Not in this case. He demanded payment. He turned a deaf ear to the fellow’s pleas for mercy and locked him in debtors’ prison. When the king found out, he threw his servant in prison.\nHow could the servant be so coldhearted? We’re left to speculate, and I speculate this much: grace never happened to him. The self-centered servant didn’t get it. The grace-given give grace. ',

The friend who listened to your problems. The grace-given, giving grace. Make sure grace happens to you—then give it to someone else.'
