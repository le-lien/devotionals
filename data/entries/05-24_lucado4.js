    "body": 'If we confess our sins …” The biggest word in the Bible just might be that tiny two-letter one if. Confessing sins—admitting we have messed up—is exactly what we often don’t want to do. We don’t want to admit we’ve failed. We are prisoners of our own pride.\n“Me? A sinner? Oh sure, I get in a little trouble once in a while, but I’m a pretty good kid.”\n“Hey, listen! I’m just as good as Amy, and I’m definitely better than Jake.”\nPretty good. Just as good. Better than. Sound familiar? We all say these things. We compare ourselves to others, and we look good. But in heaven, pretty good just isn’t good enough.\nWhen you get to the point of being sorry for your sins, when you admit that Jesus is your only choice, then confess. Tell Him about your sins, and give all your cares to Him. He is waiting for you. ',
