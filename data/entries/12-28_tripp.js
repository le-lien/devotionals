    "body": 'These are some of God’s pleasant gifts to us:\nthe sound of the birds in the spring\nthe delicate beauty of a rose\nthe multihued display of a sunset\nthe pristine blanket of new-fallen snow\nthe tenderness of a kiss\nthe smell of flowers in bloom\nthe wide variety of tastes and textures of food\nthe glory of a wonderful piece of music\nthe bright colors of leaves in the fall\nthe enjoyment of a great drama\nthe wonder of a master’s painting\nthe sweet voice of a child\nthe stunning grandeur of a mountain\nGod created for us a world of amazing beauty where pleasures exist all around us. He created us with pleasure gates (eyes, ears, mouths, noses, hands, brains, and so on) so that we could take in the pleasure. He blesses us with these good and beautiful things every day. That means that on your very worst day and on your very best day, you are blessed with pleasures that come right from the hand of God. That tells you that you don’t get these pleasures because you’ve earned or deserved them, but because he is a God of grace. He graces you with good things because he is good, not because you are.\nPerhaps it’s just a really good sandwich at lunch. You don’t deserve the pleasure of that sandwich. You don’t deserve a tongue that can take in its tastes and textures. You don’t deserve a brain that can make sense of the whole experience. It is just another gift from the hands of God, who daily bestows on you what you do not deserve because he loves you. Maybe you look out your\nwindow and see that the leaves on your tree have turned fire red. The sight takes your breath away. Stop and be thankful that the God of amazing grace created that tree and your ability to see, understand, and enjoy it. He chose you to experience its pleasure at that moment because he is the God of tender, patient grace: “For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust” (Matt. 5:45).',
