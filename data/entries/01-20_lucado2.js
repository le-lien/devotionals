    "body": 'Arthur Hays Sulzberger was the publisher of the New York Times during the Second World War. Because of the world conflict, he found it almost impossible to sleep. He was never able to banish worries from his mind until he adopted as his motto these five words—“one step enough for me”—taken from the hymn “Lead Kindly Light.”\nGod isn’t going to let you see the distant scene either. So you might as well quit looking for it. He promises a lamp unto our feet, not a crystal ball into the future. We do not need to know what will happen tomorrow.\nGod is leading you. Leave tomorrow’s problems until tomorrow. ',
