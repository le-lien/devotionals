    "body": 'No Price Is Too High\nWhen our oldest daughter, Jenna, was two, I lost her in a department store.\nOne minute she was at my side, and the next she was gone. I panicked.\nAll of a sudden only one thing mattered—I had to find my daughter.\nShopping was forgotten. The list of things I came to get was unimportant. I yelled her name. What people thought didn’t matter. For a few minutes, every ounce of energy had one goal—to find my lost child. (I did, by the way. She was hiding behind some jackets!)\nNo price is too high for a parent to pay to redeem his child. No energy is too great. No effort too demanding. A parent will go to any length to find his or her own.\nSo will God.\nMark it down. God’s greatest creation is not the flung stars or the gorged canyons; it’s his eternal plan to reach his children.
