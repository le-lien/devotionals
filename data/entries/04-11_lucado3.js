    "body": 'What if everyone worked with God in mind? Suppose no one worked to satisfy self or to make the most money but everyone worked to please God.\nMany occupations would instantly cease: drug trafficking, thievery, prostitution, nightclub and casino management. Certain careers, by their nature, cannot please God. These would end. Certain behaviors would end too. If I’m repairing a car for God, I’m not going to overcharge his children. If I’m painting a wall for God, you think I’m going to use paint thinner to cheapen the job? Nope.\nImagine if everyone worked as if God were watching. Every teacher, hopeful. Every boss, thoughtful. Every officer, careful. Every coach, insightful. Every salesperson, delightful. Every lawyer, skillful. Imagine if you went through your day with the same approach. Perhaps you’d work a little harder, speak a little kinder.\nImpossible? Not entirely. All we need is someone to start a worldwide revolution. Might as well be us. ',
