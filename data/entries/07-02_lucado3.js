What can you tell them?\nTell them that God uses struggles for his glory. The last three years of my dad’s life were scarred by ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). A healthy mechanic became a bed-bound paralytic. He lost his voice and his muscles, but he never lost his faith. Visitors noticed. Not so much in what he said but more in what he didn’t say. Never outwardly angry or bitter, Jack Lucado suffered with dignity.\nHis faith led another man to faith. After my dad’s funeral this man sought me out and told me. Because of my dad’s example, he became a Jesus follower.\nDid God allow my father’s illness for that very reason? Knowing the value God places on one soul, I wouldn’t be surprised. And imagining the wonder of heaven, I know my father’s not complaining. ',
