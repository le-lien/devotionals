They either earn their salvation by doing good things, or it is a gift from God.\nPeople who believe they can save themselves are called legalists. They believe you can work your way to heaven if you look right, say the right thing, and belong to the right group. The power to save doesn’t come from God; it comes from you.\nThese people look great on the outside. They say and do all the right things. But look closely. Something is missing. Joy. What is there instead?\nFear. They’re afraid they won’t work hard enough, be good enough, or do enough good. They’re afraid they will fail. ',
