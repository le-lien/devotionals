    "body": 'Let’s look at the example of King David in Psalm 34. The introduction to this psalm says, <i>“A psalm of David when he feigned madness before Abimelech [or Achish],  who drove him away and he departed”</i> (NASB). At this time in his life, David was a fugitive from his own country. King Saul was trying to kill him, so David had to leave his familiar surroundings.\nHe went to the court of a Gentile king for refuge, but the king suspected him of being an enemy. In order to save his own life, he had to feign madness. The historic book of 1 Samuel tells us that he scratched at the door and slobbered on his beard. (See 1 Samuel 21:10–15.) That was the situation. But what was David’s reaction?<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> <i>I will bless the Lord at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth. My soul shall make its boast in the Lord; the humble shall hear it and rejoice. O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt His name together.(</i>salm 34:1–3 nasb)</p>Right there, in the midst of such a terrible situation, with his life hanging in the balance and the shame of having to feign madness, David praised the Lord. That is the sacrifice of praise. When he was at his lowest, David decided to go on boasting in the Lord. When there was nothing else to boast about, he decided to boast in the Lord.\nThen, David went on,  <i>“O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt His name together.”</i>  Praise is contagious. If we learn to praise God in this way, others will join in. But grumbling is contagious, too. If we grumble, we will attract fellow grumblers. We must learn to offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually. ',
