God, who punishes sin, releases his rightful wrath on your mistakes. Jesus receives the blow. Since Christ is between you and God, you don’t. The sin is punished, but you are safe—\nsafe in the shadow of the cross.\nThis is what God did, but why, why would he do it? Moral duty?\nHeavenly obligation? Paternal requirement? No. God is required to do nothing.\nThe reason for the cross? God loves the world. ',
