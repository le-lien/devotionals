    "body": 'Imagine the pool of Bethesda. In Bible times, it was the place where the hopelessly sick came (John 5:1 – 9). It was, they believed, their one last chance to be healed. For at a certain time, an angel would stir the waters of the pool. Whoever stepped in first, after the waters were stirred, would be healed.\nBut imagine all those who weren’t healed. Imagine walking by the pool.\nThe ground around it must have looked like a battlefield covered with wounded bodies.\nAs people passed by, what did they hear? An endless wave of groans.\nWhat did they see? A field of faceless needs. What did they do? Most just walked past. But not Jesus. The people needed Him, so He was there.\nLittle did they know that this was God—walking slowly, stepping carefully between the beggars and the blind. Because wherever His hurting children are, that is where God is. ',
