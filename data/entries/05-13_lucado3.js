I am: (a) a coincidental collision of particles.\n(b) an accidental evolution of molecules.\n(c) soulless matter in the universe.\n(d) “fearfully and wonderfully made.”\nDon’t dull your life by missing this point: you are more than statistical chance, more than a product of your genes and experience, more than a combination of inherited chromosomes and childhood trauma. More than a walking weather vane whipped about by the cold winds of fate. Thanks to God you can say, “You shaped me first inside, then out… . Body and soul, I am marvelously made! … You know exactly how I was made, bit by bit, how I was sculpted from nothing into something” (Psalm 139:13–15 MSG).\nBecause of your Maker, that “something” is something special.\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
