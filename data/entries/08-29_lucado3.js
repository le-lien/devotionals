She’s been adopted.\nHer adoptive parents are friends of mine. They brought her pictures, a teddy bear, granola bars, and cookies. Carinette shared the goodies and asked the director to guard her bear, but she keeps the pictures. They remind her of her home-to-be. Within a month, two at the most, she’ll be there. She knows the day is coming. Any time now her father will appear. He came once to claim her. He’ll come again to carry her home. Till then she lives with a heart headed home.\nShouldn’t we all? Our Father paid us a visit too. Have we not been claimed? Adopted? God searched you out. Before you knew you needed adopting, he’d already filed the papers and selected the wallpaper for your room.
