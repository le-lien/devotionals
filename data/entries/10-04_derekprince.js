    "body": 'In Isaiah 62, God calls us to intense, persistent prayer, especially on behalf of Jerusalem:\nI have posted watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem; they will never be silent day or night. You who call on the Lord, give yourselves no rest, and give him no rest till he establishes Jerusalem and makes her the praise of the earth.\n(Isaiah 62:6–7 niv)\nIn the New Testament, Jesus related the parable of the unjust judge, whom a widow kept beseeching incessantly. Jesus concluded with this question: “And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night?” (Luke 18:7 niv). Both these passages indicate that some themes are so important and urgent that they demand our prayers not only in the daytime, but through the night hours, as well. The restoration of Jerusalem is one of these themes.\nThe prophet Isaiah also described these “watchmen”  as those “who call on the Lord.”  The literal Hebrew meaning of the word translated\n“call”  is interesting. It means “those who  remind the Lord.” In modern Hebrew, it is the word for a secretary. One important task of a secretary is reminding the employer of the appointments recorded on his calendar. This provides practical insight into the way God wants us to pray for Jerusalem. As His “intercessor-secretaries,” we have two main responsibilities: first, to be familiar with His prophetic calendar; second, to remind Him of the appointments recorded in it. One such appointment is God’s end-time commitment to restore Israel and to rebuild Jerusalem. ',
