Because Jesus takes up for you… . “He is able always to save those who come to God through him because he always lives, asking God to help them” (Heb. 7:25)… .\nJesus, at this very moment, is protecting you… . Evil must pass through Christ before it can touch you. And God will “never let you be pushed past your limit; he’ll always be there to help you come through it” (1 Cor. 10:13\nMSG). ',
