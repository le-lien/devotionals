    "body": 'od has a design, a purpose, a rest of faith. We are saved by faith and kept by faith. Faith is substance; it is also evidence G (Heb. 11:1). God is! He is! And “He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him”  (v. 6). We are to testify, to bear witness to what we know. To know that we know is a wonderful position to be in. We are to be living words, epistles of Christ (2 Cor. 3:3), known and read by all men.\n\nWe are living in the inheritance of faith because of the grace of God. We are saved for eternity by the operation of the Spirit, who brings forth life unto God. Heaven is brought to earth until God quickens all things into beauty, manifesting His power in living witnesses. God is in us for the world, so that the world may be blessed. We need power to lay hold of Omnipotence and to impart to others the Word of Life. This is a new epoch with new vision and new power. Christ in us is greater than we know. All things are possible if you dare to believe. The treasure is in earthen vessels so that Jesus may be glorified (2 Cor. 4:7).\n\nLet us go forth bringing glory to God. Faith is substance, a mightiness of reality, a deposit of divine nature, and the creative God abiding with us. The moment you believe, you are clothed with a new power to lay hold of possibility and make it reality. The people said to Jesus, “Lord, give us this bread always”  (John 6:34). Jesus said, “He who feeds on Me will live because of Me”  (v. 57).\n\nHave the faith of God. The man who comes into great association with God needs a heavenly measure. Faith is the greatest of all. We are saved by a new life, the Word of God, an association with the living Christ. A new creation continually takes us into new revelation.',
