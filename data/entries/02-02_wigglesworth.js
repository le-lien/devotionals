Eternal in duration.\n\nInexpressible in valor.\n\nInfinite in scope.\n\nRegenerative in power.\n\nInfallible in authority.\n\nUniversal in application.\n\nInspired in totality. We should:\n\nRead it through.\n\nWrite it down.\n\nPray it in.\n\nWork it out.\n\nPass it on. The Word of God changes a person until he becomes an epistle of God (2 Cor. 3:3). The Word transforms the mind, changes the character, and gives us an inheritance in the Spirit, until we are conformed—God coming in, dwelling in us, walking and talking through us. There is no God like our God.\n\nGod is love. “He who abides in love abides in God”  (1 John 4:16). God wants to take ordinary men and bring them into extraordinary conditions. God has room for the thirsty man who is crying out for more of Himself. It is not what we are, but it is what God wants us to be. Beloved, let us rededicate ourselves afresh to God!',
