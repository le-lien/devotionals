All of Leviticus 11 enumerates complicated regulations regarding what to eat, what to wear, and what makes one clean or unclean.\nGod’s requirement was to “consecrate yourselves”  (Leviticus 11:44).\nBut you find out from this chapter that maintaining holiness was very complicated. There was a series of the most involved regulations.\nThese also shall be unclean to you among the creeping things that creep on the earth: the mole, the mouse, and the large lizard…; the gecko, the monitor lizard, the sand reptile, the sand lizard, and the chameleon….Whoever touches them when they are dead shall be unclean until evening.\n(Leviticus 11:29–31) ',
