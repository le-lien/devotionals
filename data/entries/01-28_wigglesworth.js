    "body": 'magine a young man and woman who have fallen in love. In a short while, there is a strong love for each other. What is a I heart of love? It is a heart of faith. Faith and love are kin. In the measure that the young man and young woman love one another, they are true. One may go North and the other South, but because of their love, they will be faithful to one another.\n\nIt is the same when there is a deep love toward the Lord Jesus Christ. In this new life into which God has brought us, Paul told us that we “have become dead to the law through the body of Christ, that [we]  may be married to another; to Him who was raised from the dead”  (Rom. 7:4). God brings us into a place of perfect love and perfect faith. A person who is born of God is brought into a loyalty to the Lord Jesus that shrinks from anything impure. You see the purity of a man and woman when there is a deep natural affection between them; they disdain the very thought of either of them being untrue. In the same way, in the measure that a person has faith in Jesus, he is pure.\n\nWe cannot doubt in our hearts. As we read His Word and believe the promises that He has so graciously given to us, we are made partakers of His very essence and life. The Lord is made a Bridegroom to us, and we are His bride. His words to us are spirit and life (John 6:63), transforming us and changing us, expelling what is natural and bringing in what is divine.\n\nIt is impossible to comprehend the love of God as we think in human terms. We must have a revelation from the Spirit of God. It was the love of God that brought Jesus, and it is this same love that helps you and me to believe. God will be your strength in every weakness. You who need His touch, remember that He loves you. If you are helpless or sick, look to the God of all grace, whose very essence is love, who delights to give liberally all life and strength and power that you need.',
