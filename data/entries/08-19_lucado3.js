    "body": 'When we walk out our front doors each morning, we enter a danger zone.\nAll of us battle a fierce foe called temptation. None of us are immune.\nThe devil has tempted everyone, starting with Adam and including even Jesus. The first with fruit. The second with bread. You and me? It could be with the pretty girl walking by, the wallet lying on the sidewalk, the test answer on the desk next to us.\nWe can help each other win this fight. A girl chooses a modest outfit, allowing guys to keep their eyes and minds under control. A buddy asks how our God time is going, pointing us toward treasured truth. A friend says, “Are you sure that’s a good idea?” providing us with a second chance at a better choice.\nWhen temptation threatens to topple your friends, encourage them to turn to your heavenly Father. He loves to hold the hands of his children. “The LORD directs the steps of the godly” (Psalm 37:23 NLT). He’ll lead them—\nand you—out of the danger zone. ',
