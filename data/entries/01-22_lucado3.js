    "body": 'Most of us struggle with prayer. We forget to pray, and when we remember, we hurry through prayers with hollow words. Our minds drift; our thoughts scatter faster than friends at the end-of-school bell.\nOur battle with prayer is not entirely our fault. Satan seeks to interrupt our prayers. The devil knows what happens when we talk with God. “Our weapons have power from God that can destroy the enemy’s strong places” (2\nCorinthians 10:4 NCV). Satan does not stutter or stumble when you walk through church doors. Demons aren’t flustered when you read this book. But the walls of hell shake when one person with an honest, faithful heart prays,\n“Oh, God, you are so great.”\nSatan scampers like a spooked pooch when we move forward in prayer.\nSo let’s do. “Humble yourselves before God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Come close to God, and God will come close to you” (James 4:7–8\nNLT). ',
