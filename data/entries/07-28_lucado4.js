But you will follow later” (John 13:36).\nSaying something like that left the disciples with some questions. Peter spoke for the others and asked, “Lord, why can’t I follow you now?” (John 13:37).\nJesus’ answer was tender, just as a parent is tender when answering a child. “Don’t let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God. And trust in me.\nThere are many rooms in my Father’s house. I would not tell you this if it were not true. I am going there to prepare a place for you… . I will come back. Then I will take you to be with me so that you may be where I am”\n(John 14:1–3). ',

If your parents—who are not perfect—know how to take care of you, how much more will God—who is perfect—take care of you?'
