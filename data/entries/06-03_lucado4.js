He can’t see well and he’s worn out. Doesn’t look like a hero, does he?\nDoesn’t sound like one either. He called himself the worst sinner in history. He was a Christian-killer before he was a Christian leader. At times his heart was so heavy, Paul’s pen dragged itself across the page. “What a miserable man I am! Who will save me from this body that brings me death?” (Romans 7:24).\nOnly heaven knows how long Paul stared at that question before he found the courage to write, “I thank [God] for saving me through Jesus Christ our Lord!” (Romans 7:25).\nYes, look and see this apostle of God. Look and see this true hero of faith. ',
