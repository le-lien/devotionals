    "body": 'Those who saw Jesus—really saw him— knew there was something different. At his touch blind beggars saw. At his command crippled legs walked. At his embrace empty lives filled with vision.\nHe fed thousands with one basket. He stilled a storm with one command.\nHe raised the dead with one proclamation. He changed lives with one request. He rerouted the history of the world with one life, lived in one country, was born in one manger, and died on one hill… .\nGod did what we wouldn’t dare dream. He did what we couldn’t imagine.\nHe became a man so we could trust him. He became a sacrifice so we could know him. And he defeated death so we could follow him.\nIt defies logic. It is a divine insanity. A holy incredibility.\nOnly a Creator beyond the fence of logic could offer such a gift of love. ',
