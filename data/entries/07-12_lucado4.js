Repent  means we stop doing what is wrong and we try to do what is right. It is turning away from selfishness and sin and turning to God.\nIt’s like a spiritual U-turn.\nWhen we repent, the sadness we feel on the inside  shows itself in the way we act on the outside.\nYou look at the love of God and compare it to your sins. You can’t believe He loves you like He does—with all your mess-ups and mix-ups. ',

They turn around and start going the right way. That’s repentance—not just stopping, but turning around and going the right way.'
