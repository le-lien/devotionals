It’s a battleship. We aren’t called to a life of fun and games, but of service. Each of us has a different job to do. Some who have a heart for those who are drowning in sin are snatching people out of the water and pulling them onto God’s boat of grace. Others are busy with the enemy, working the cannons of prayer and worship. Still others are feeding and training the crew.\nAlthough different, we are all the same. Each of us can tell the story of our personal meeting with the Captain because each of us has met Him.\nWe’ve followed Him across the gangplank of His grace and onto His boat. ',
