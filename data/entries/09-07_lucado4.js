In 1 Corinthians 6:9–10, Paul listed the types of people who will not be in the kingdom of heaven. The group he described is a ragged mixture of those who worship idols, get drunk, rob people, and—\nthere it is— lie about others.\nSuch a strict rule may surprise you. You mean my fibbing and little white lies make God as angry as drugs and drunkenness?  Yes.\nWhy the hard line? Why the tough stand? ',

But think of it this way: If your pizza just had a little bit of rat poison on it instead of a whole lot, would you eat it? No! It doesn’t matter how big the lie is, it still poisons your soul.'
