    "body": 'Resentment is the cocaine of the emotions. It causes our blood to pump and our energy level to rise. But, also like cocaine, it demands increasingly large and more frequent dosages. There is a dangerous point at which anger ceases to be an emotion and becomes a driving force. A person bent on revenge moves unknowingly further and further away from being able to forgive, for to be without the anger is to be without a source of energy.\nHatred is the rabid dog that turns on its owner.\nRevenge is the raging fire that consumes the arsonist.\nBitterness is the trap that snares the hunter.\nAnd mercy is the choice that can set them all free.
