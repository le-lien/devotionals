    "body": 'It didn’t start with the cross; from the very first breath he took until he ascended, Jesus suffered:<ul><li>He suffered an uncomfortable and unsanitary birth in a stable.</li><li>He suffered the terror of fleeing for his life as an infant.</li><li>He suffered the trials of growing and learning as a boy.</li><li>He suffered powerful temptation.</li><li>He suffered exposure to disease.</li><li>He suffered homelessness.</li><li>He suffered hunger.</li><li>He suffered sadness and grief.</li><li>He suffered disloyalty and betrayal.</li><li>He suffered physical pain.</li><li>He suffered disrespect and mockery.</li><li>He suffered misunderstanding and misrepresentation.</li><li>He suffered the emotional pain of the rejection of his Father.</li><li>He suffered punishment for the sins of others.</li><li>He suffered injustice.</li><li>He suffered violence.</li><li>He suffered death.</li><li>He suffered the full range of the hardships of life in this fallen world.</ul>His calling, his mission, was to suffer, and suffer he did. His suffering was wide-ranging and constant. For the Messiah, suffering was an everyday thing, even a moment-by-moment thing. And every act of his suffering was substitutional. He suffered in our place. He suffered in every way we do so that he could be a Savior to us in our suffering and put an end to our suffering. He suffered every day so that there would be a time when all suffering would end and so that we could live with him in a world where suffering is no more.\nHe did not come to earth in regal splendor. He did not come to earth to live in a palace and be given homage as King. Although he was the King of kings, he came as a suffering servant who, in his suffering, would save us from ourselves and finally from our suffering. His suffering is our salvation. His suffering is our hope.',
