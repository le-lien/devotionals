Try to forget your past; he’ll remind you. Try to fix your mistakes; he will trip you up.\nSatan has no greater goal than to take you to God’s courtroom and press charges. He yells, “This one You call Your child, God, he doesn’t deserve Your forgiveness. He’s made too many mistakes.”\nAs he speaks, you hang your head. You know he is right. “I plead guilty, Your Honor,” you mumble.\n“What is the sentence?” Satan asks.\n“The punishment for sin is death,” explains the Judge, “but Jesus Christ died as payment for this person’s sins.”\nSatan suddenly has nothing to say. And you are suddenly filled with joy. ',
