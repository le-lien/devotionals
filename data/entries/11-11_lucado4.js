But what does that mean— to be clothed with Christ?\nListen to how Jesus described those who live in heaven: “Around the throne there were … 24 elders sitting on the 24 thrones. The elders were dressed in white, and they had golden crowns on their heads” (Revelation 4:4).\nAll are dressed in white. The saints. The elders. So how would you think Jesus is dressed? In white, right? No. “He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood” (Revelation 19:13).\nWhy is Jesus’ robe not white? Why is His robe not spotless? Why is His robe dipped in blood? Paul said simply, “He changed places with us”\n(Galatians 3:13).\nJesus wore our coat of sin to the cross. ',
