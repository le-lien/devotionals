So he sent Jesus a question: “Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?” (Matthew 11:3 NIV).\nJesus understood. He didn’t scold John for his doubt.

John had been listening for an answer to his earthly problems—a way out of prison. But Jesus was busy taking care of John’s heavenly problem—a way into heaven. Remember that the next time you think God hasn’t answered your prayers.',
