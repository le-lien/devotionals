If God has to choose between your eternal safety and your earthly comfort, which do you hope he chooses?\nWhat if he moved you to another land? (As he did Abraham.) What if he called you out of retirement? (Remember Moses?) How about the voice of an angel or the bowel of a fish? (A la Gideon and Jonah.) How about a promotion like Daniel’s or a demotion like Samson’s?\nGod does what it takes to get our attention. Isn’t that the message of the Bible? The relentless pursuit of God. God on the hunt. God in the search.\nPeeking under the bed for hiding kids, stirring the bushes for lost sheep. ',
