    "body": 'o service is so wonderful to me as the service of partaking in the Lord‘s Supper, the Holy Communion. I would love N to see the saints gather together at every meeting in order to remember Christ‘s death, His resurrection, and His ascension. What a thought that Jesus Himself instituted this glorious memorial for us. Oh, that God would let us see that it is “as often”  as we do it. It is not weekly, not monthly, not quarterly, but “as often” as we do it. What a blessed remembrance it is to know that He took away our sins.\n\nI am sure that every Christian has a great desire to do something for Jesus, and what He wants us to do is to keep in remembrance the cross, the grave, the Resurrection, and the Ascension; the memory of these four events will always bring us into a place of great blessing. You do not need, however, to continually live on the cross, or even in remembrance of the cross, but what you need to remember about the cross is, “It is finished”  (John 19:30). You do not need to live in the grave, but only keep in remembrance that “He is risen” (Matt. 28:6) out of the grave and that we are to be seated “with Him in glory”  (Col. 3:4).\n\nThe institution of the Lord‘s Supper is one of those settings in Scripture, a time in the history of our Lord Jesus Christ, when the mystery of the glories of Christ was being unveiled. As the Master walked on this earth, the multitudes would gather with eagerness and longing in their hearts to hear the words that dropped from His gracious lips. But there were also those who had missed the vision. They saw the Christ, heard His words, but those wonderful words were like idle tales to them.\n\nWhen we miss the vision and do not come into the fullness of the ministry of the Spirit, there is a reason. Beloved, there is a deadness in us that must have the resurrection touch. Today we have the unveiled truth, for the dispensation of the Holy Spirit has come to unfold the fullness of redemption so that we might be 58\n\nclothed with power. What brings us into the state where God can pour His blessing upon us is a broken spirit and a contrite heart (Ps. 51:17). We need to examine ourselves to see what state we are in, whether we are just religious or whether we are truly in Christ.\n\nThe human spirit, when perfectly united with the Holy Spirit, has but one place, and that is death, death, and deeper death. In this place, the human spirit will cease to desire to have its own way, and instead of "My will," the cry of the heart will be, "May Your will, O Lord, be done in me."',
