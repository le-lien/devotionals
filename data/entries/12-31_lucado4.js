    "body": 'Jesus has a message just for you. It is whispered in every word of the New Testament:\nIf only you knew that I came to help and not judge. If only you knew that tomorrow will be better than today. If only you knew the gift that I bring you: eternal life. If only you knew I want you safely home with Me. If only you knew.\nWhat wishful, wistful words to come from the lips of God. How kind that He would let us hear them. How important it is that we stop to hear them. If only we knew to trust God. Trust that He is in our corner. Trust that God wants what is best for us.\nIf only we could learn to trust Him. Won’t you trust Him?\nGrowing in Grace\nThe things of this world end. Holidays end, years end, even lives end. But God never ends. His love, His faithfulness, His promises, His mercy, grace, and forgiveness never end. Believe Him and His Word. Make that your number one goal this coming year—to trust God completely.\nReading the Bible\nThe Bible is the  most important book you will ever read. It is God’s plan for your life. In the Bible, God tells you how to love Him and how to love others. He tells you what is right and what is wrong. And most important of all, He tells you how to get to heaven. Because the Bible is so important, it’s a good idea to read something from it every day.\nTry one of these reading plans to help you get started. Put a check next to each one as you read it. 30 Days with Jesus  walks you through the life of Jesus, telling of the things He did and taught while He was here on earth. 90\nDays Through the Bible  gives you all the major happenings of the Old and New Testaments, beginning with the Creation in Genesis and going all the way through to Revelation.\n30 Days with Jesus\n1.
