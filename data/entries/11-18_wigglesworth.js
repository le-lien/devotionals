    "body": 'iscernment is a very necessary gift to understand. Most people seem to think it is a discerning of human persons. D It is amazing to find that many people I come across seem to have a tremendous bent toward "discerning" others. If you carefully put this discerning of one another into real practice upon yourself for twelve months, you will never presume to try it upon another. You will see so many faults about yourself, that you will say, "O God, make me right!"\n\nThere is a vast difference between natural discernment and spiritual discernment. This statement of Jesus is remarkable:\n\nHow can you say to your brother, “Let me remove the speck from your eye”; and look, a plank is in your own eye? Hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother‟s eye.\n\n(Matt. 7:4–5) Remember that if you begin judging, it will lead you to judgment (vv. 1–2). If you begin using your discernment to weigh people by your standards, it will lead you to judgment. Ever since God showed me Romans 2:1–3, I have been very careful to examine myself before I begin judging. Balance that in your heart. It will save you from judging.\n\nMany notable people in the world have gotten to running another person down and finding fault. They are always faultfind-ing and judging people outright. I find that those people always fall in the mire. If I were to mention these people by name, you would know that what I am saying is true.\n\nGod save us from criticism! When we are pure in heart, we on-ly think about pure things. When we are impure in heart, we speak and act and think as we are in our hearts. The pure in heart see purity.',
