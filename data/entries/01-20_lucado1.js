You’ve grumbled.\nYou’ve hoarded when you should have shared. You’ve turned away when you should have helped… .\nBecause of sin, you’ve snapped at the ones you love and argued with the ones you cherish. You have felt ashamed, guilty, bitter.\nSin has sired a thousand heartaches and broken a million promises. Your addiction can be traced back to sin. Your mistrust can be traced back to sin.\nBigotry, robbery, adultery—all because of sin. But in heaven, all of this will end.\nCan you imagine a world without sin? If so, you can imagine heaven. ',
