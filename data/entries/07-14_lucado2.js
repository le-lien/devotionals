In the cellar of your heart lurk the ghosts of yesterday’s sins. Sins you’ve confessed; errors of which you’ve repented; damage you’ve done your best to repair… .\nThat horrid lie.\nThe time you exploded in anger.\nNow, honestly. Do you think God was exaggerating when he said he would cast our sins as far as the east is from the west? Do you actually believe he would make a statement like “I will not hold their iniquities against them” and then rub our noses in them whenever we ask for help?\nOf course you don’t. You and I just need an occasional reminder of God’s nature, his forgetful nature. ',
