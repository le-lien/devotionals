    "body": 'Has any other book ever been described like this: “For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart” (Hebrews 4:12 NIV)?\n“Alive and active.” The words of the Bible have life! God works through these words. The Bible is to God what a surgical glove is to the surgeon. Haven’t you felt his touch?\nIn a late, lonely hour, you read the words “I will never fail you. I will never abandon you” (Hebrews 13:5 NLT). The sentences comfort like a hand on your shoulder. When anxiety tears away at your peace, someone shares this passage: “Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God” (Philippians 4:6 NIV). The words stir a sigh from your soul.\nPut them to use. Don’t make a decision, whether large or small, without sitting before God with an open Bible, open heart, and open ears.',
