    "body": 'ome of you wonder what is up when you are not healed in a moment. God never breaks His promise. The trial of your S faith is “much more precious than gold.”\n\nGod wants to destroy the power of the Devil. He wants to move you so that in the face of hardships, you will praise the Lord. “Count it all joy” (James 1:2). You have to take a leap today; you have to leap into the promises. You have to believe that God never fails you; you have to believe it is impossible for God to break His word. He is “from everlasting to everlasting”  (Ps. 90:2).\n\nForever and ever, not for a day,\n\nHe keepeth His promise forever;\n\nTo all who believe,\n\nTo all who obey,\n\nHe keepeth His promise forever. There is no variableness with God, no “shadow of turning” (James 1:17). He is the same. He manifests His divine glory.\n\nJesus said to Mary and Martha, “If you would believe you would see the glory of God” (John 11:40). We must understand that there will be times of testing, but they are only to make us more like the Master. He was  “in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin”  (Heb. 4:15). He endured all things. He is our example.\n\nOh, that God would place us in an earnest, intent position in which flesh and blood have to yield to the Spirit of God! We will go forward; we will not be moved by our feelings.\n\nSuppose that a man who is prayed for today receives a blessing, but tomorrow he begins murmuring because he does not feel exactly as he wants to feel. What is he doing? He is replacing the Word of God with his feelings. What a disgrace! Let God have His perfect work.',
