His face was changed, and it “became bright like the sun” (Matthew 17:2).\nWhen we worship, our face becomes filled with the light and love of God.\nThe link between the face and worship is no accident. Our face is the most seen part of our bodies. It is covered less than any other part. It is also the way people know who we are. We don’t fill a school yearbook with pictures of people’s feet. We fill it with pictures of faces. God wants to take our faces—the most seen and the most easily remembered part of us—and use them like a mirror to reflect His goodness. ',
