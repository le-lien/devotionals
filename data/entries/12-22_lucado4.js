    "body": 'Have you ever traded for something? Maybe watched your mom and dad trade for a car? It usually goes something like this: If you give me this, then I’ll give you that.\nOther religions are that way. They are barter systems—which simply means people trade their way to heaven. Their god says to them, If you do this for me, then I’ll do this for you. Their god saves them based on what they do (works), what they feel (emotions), or how much they know (knowledge).\nChristianity isn’t like that at all. We don’t bargain with God. We don’t have anything to bargain with. Yes, we should go to church, pray, read our Bible, and help others. But no matter how good we are, our goodness is never good enough to trade for His grace. His grace doesn’t depend on what we do, what we feel, or what we know. His grace depends on Him. ',
