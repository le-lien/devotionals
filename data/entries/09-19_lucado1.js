    "body": 'The Hebrew writer gives us a National Geographic  piece on heaven. Listen to how he describes the mountaintop of Zion. He says when we reach the mountain we will have come to “the city of the living God… .\nTo thousands of angels gathered together with joy… . To the meeting of God’s firstborn children whose names are written in heaven” (Heb. 12:22–\n23).\nWhat a mountain! Won’t it be great to see the angels? To finally know what they look like and who they are? …\nImagine the meeting of the firstborn. A gathering of all God’s children.\nNo jealousy. No competition. No division. . . . We will be perfect . . .\nsinless… .\nAnd imagine seeing God. Finally, to gaze in the face of your Father. To feel the Father’s gaze upon you. Neither will ever cease. ',
