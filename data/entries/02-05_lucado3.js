    "body": 'Picture a woman in bed, her sleep interrupted by voices. “Get up, you harlot.” “What kind of woman do you think you are?” Her accusers marched her through narrow streets and thrust her before the holiest judge of all. “Teacher,” they said, “this woman was caught in the very act of adultery.\nThe law of Moses says to stone her. What do you say?” (John 8:2–5 NLT).\nJesus stood on behalf of the woman, placed himself between her and the lynch mob, and said, “‘All right, but let the one who has never sinned throw the first stone!’ Then he stooped down again and wrote in the dust” (vv. 7–8\nNLT). Name-callers shut their mouths. Rocks fell to the ground. Accusers slipped away one by one.\nJesus stands up for you too. In the presence of God, in defiance of Satan, he rises to your defense and offers a future free from blame—not just from your past mistakes but also from the ones ahead. Christ forever stands in on your behalf. ',
