    "body": 'The Bible says, “If our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things”  (1 John 3:20). We need not keep anything from God. We have to be open and honest with Him—sincerely confessing every transgression, sinful thought, and shortcoming. But then, when all has been confessed, we need to accept complete forgiveness and complete cleansing, for we know that God will never remember our sins or hold them against us anymore. Then, we can come to Him without condemnation.\nSpeaking about prayer, Paul said in 1 Timothy 2:8, “I desire therefore that the men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.”  We must get rid of the dark inner emotions and attitudes that hinder our access to God. We must get rid of wrath and doubting.\nThe Bible says that if we doubt, we are condemned. (See Romans 14:23.) You see, we cannot come with condemnation into the presence of God.\nThe Bible says,\nHe who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind. For let not that man suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.\n(James 1:6–8)\nWe must dismiss the whole question of guilt, along with every negative or wrong attitude concerning ourselves and other people. We must come boldly. As Hebrews 4:16 says, “Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.”  Remember, it is a throne of grace that we approach, and grace is enthroned with God. It is not justice we come to God for; rather, it is grace. ',
