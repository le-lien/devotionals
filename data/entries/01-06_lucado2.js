He was God-man.\nMidwifed by a carpenter.\nBathed by a peasant girl.\nThe maker of the world with a bellybutton.\nThe author of the Torah being taught the Torah.\nHeaven’s human. And because he was, we are left with scratch-your-head, double-blink, what’s-wrong-with-this-picture? moments like these:\nA cripple sponsoring the town dance.\nA sack lunch satisfying five thousand tummies.\nWhat do we do with such moments?\nWhat do we do with such a person? We applaud men for doing good things. We enshrine God for doing great things. But when a man does God things?\nOne thing is certain, we can’t ignore him. ',
