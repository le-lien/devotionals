You are never the victim of nature or the prey of fate. Chance is eliminated. You are more than a weather vane whipped about by the winds of fortune.\nWould God truly abandon you to the whims of drug-crazed thieves, greedy corporate raiders, or evil leaders? Perish the thought!\nWe live beneath the protective palm of a sovereign King who superintends every circumstance of our lives and delights in doing us good.\nNothing comes your way that has not first passed through the filter of his love.
