But whether or not we say yes to His invitation is our choice.\nIsn’t it incredible that God leaves the choice to us? Think about it. There are many things in life we can’t choose. We can’t, for example, choose our family. We can’t choose the weather. We can’t choose whether or not we are born with a big nose or blue eyes or curly hair. We can’t even choose how people act toward us.\nBut we can choose where we spend eternity. The big choice God leaves to us. The most important choice is ours.\nAnd it’s the only choice that really matters. ',
