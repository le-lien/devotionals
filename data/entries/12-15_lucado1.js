The friend who owes you money just drove by in a new car. The boss who hired you with promises of promotions has forgotten how to pronounce your name… . And you are hurt.\nPart of you is broken, and the other part is bitter. Part of you wants to cry, and part of you wants to fight… . There is a fire burning in your heart. It’s the fire of anger… .\nAnd you are left with a decision. “Do I put the fire out or heat it up? Do I get over it or get even? Do I release it or resent it? Do I let my hurts heal, or do I let hurt turn into hate?” …\nUnfaithfulness is wrong. Revenge is bad. But the worst part of all is that, without forgiveness, bitterness is all that is left. ',
