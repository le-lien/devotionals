The question to ask at times like these is, “Will God bless my lies?” Will He bless a plan built on fibs and falsehoods? Will the Lord—\nwho loves the truth—bless this web of lies? Will God honor the schoolwork of a cheat?\nNo, I don’t think so either.\nTake a look inside your heart. Ask yourself some tough questions: Am I being totally honest with my mom and dad? Are my words truthful? What about at school? Am I honest with my teachers? Am I a trustworthy student? An honest friend?\nDo you tell the truth . . . always? If not, start today. Don’t wait until tomorrow to be truthful. The ripple of today’s lies will become tomorrow’s wave of fibs and next year’s flood of falsehood. ',
