You messed up, but you’ll mess up more if you let yesterday’s mistakes sabotage today’s attitude.\nGod’s mercies are new every morning. Receive them. Learn a lesson from the Cascade forests of Washington State. Some of its trees are hundreds of years old, far surpassing the typical life span of fifty to sixty years. One leaf-laden fellow dates back seven centuries! What makes the difference?\nDaily drenching rains. Downpours keep the ground moist, the trees wet, and the lightning ineffective.12\nLightning strikes you as well. Thunderbolts of regret can ignite and consume you. Counteract them with torrents of God’s grace, daily washings of forgiveness. Once a year won’t do. Once a month is insufficient. Weekly showers leave you dry. Sporadic mistings leave you combustible. You need a solid soaking every day. “The LORD’S love never ends; his mercies never stop. They are new every morning” (Lamentations 3:22–23 NCV). ',

      "text": 'God’s grace is like that—a cleansing shower that washes away every last trace of sorrow, guilt, and regret. We need it because we do find ways to keep messing up. How did you mess up yesterday? Or today? It’s time, right now, to talk to God about it. I already hear a shower headed your way.'
