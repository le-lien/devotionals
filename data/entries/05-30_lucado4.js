    "body": 'Matthew wrote that Jesus “healed those who were sick.” Not some of the sick. Not just the good people among the sick. Not the deserving among the sick. But “those who were sick.”\nSurely, among the many thousands, there were a few people who didn’t deserve good health. The same God who gave Jesus the power to heal also gave Him the power to see into people’s hearts. I wonder if Jesus was ever tempted to say to the liar, “Get out of here, buddy, and take your tales with you.”\nAnd Jesus could not only see their past, but He could also see their future. There were surely those in the crowds who would use their new health to hurt others. Jesus healed tongues that might someday curse. He gave sight to eyes that could covet their neighbor’s things. He healed hands that could kill.\nEach time Jesus healed, He had to overlook the future and the past.\nSomething, by the way, that He still does today—for us. ',
