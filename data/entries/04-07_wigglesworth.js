    "body": 'esus spoke to Nicodemus and told him that this new birth is not flesh and blood; it is the life of God. It is a spiritual life, as J real as God, as true as God. We are formed in God‘s very image. He has quickened us and made us to be like Him with an inward, spiritual life. Just as we have our humanity, so the new nature, the new power, is continually forming a new man in us after the order of Him. The first Adam was formed, and we are in the vision of him; the last Adam, the new creation, is going to have a vision and expression like Him.\n\nI was once exactly where Nicodemus was; I said, “How can these things be?”  (John 3:9). Then there came by faith a regenerat-ing power that made me know I was born of God. It came like the wind. I could not see it, but I felt it. It had a tremendous effect upon my human nature, and I found that I was a new creation. I found I wanted to pray and to talk about the Lord. Oh, I will never forget saying "Father."\n\nIf you catch this truth, it does not matter where you are. If you are in exile somewhere—isolated from everybody, far from any human comfort—if this life gets into you, you will know that when He comes again, you will go to meet Him.\n\nWhen you are born of God, God‘s nature comes in. I won‘t call it the germ of eternal life, but the seed of God, because we are conceived by the Word, we are quickened by the power, we are made after His order. What is from above has entered into what is below, and you have now become a quickened spirit. You were dead, without aspiration, and without desire. As soon as His life comes in, aspiration, desire, and prayer ascend, lifting higher and higher, and you have already moved toward heavenly things.',
