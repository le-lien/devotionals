    "body": 'Our high school baseball coach had a firm rule against chewing tobacco.\nWe had a couple of players who were known to sneak a chew, and he wanted to call it to our attention. He got our attention, all right. Before long we’d all tried it. A sure test of manhood was to take a chew when the pouch was passed down the bench. I had barely made the team; I sure wasn’t going to fail the test of manhood.\nOne day I’d just popped a plug in my mouth when one of the players warned, “Here comes the coach!” Not wanting to get caught, I did what came naturally and swallowed. I added new meaning to the scripture, “I felt weak deep inside me. I moaned all day long” (Psalm 32:3 NCV). I paid the price for hiding my disobedience.\nMy body was not made to ingest tobacco. Your soul was not made to ingest sin.\nMay I ask a blunt question? Are you keeping any secrets from God? Take a pointer from a nauseated third baseman. You’ll feel better if you get it out. ',
