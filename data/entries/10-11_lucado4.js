    "body": 'It would be hard to find someone worse than Judas. Some say he was a good man with a bad plan. I don’t believe that. The Bible says, “Judas . .\n. was a thief ” (John 12:6). The man was a crook. Somehow he was able to live beside Jesus, to be part of the miracles, and still be unchanged. In the end, he decided he would rather have money than a friend, so he sold Jesus for thirty pieces of silver. Judas was a rat, a cheat, and a bum. How could anyone see him any other way?\nSomehow Jesus did. Only inches from the face of His betrayer, Jesus looked at Judas and said, “Friend, do the thing you came to do” (Matthew 26:50). I can’t imagine what Jesus saw in Judas that was worthy of being called friend. But Jesus doesn’t lie, and in that moment He saw something good in a very bad man.\nJesus can help us to see the good in those who hurt us too. ',
