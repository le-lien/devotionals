Christ doesn’t fill out an application or ask permission; he simply boards the boat and begins to preach.\nHe can do that, you know. All boats belong to Christ. Your boat is where you spend your day, make your living, and to a large degree live your life.\nThe taxi you drive, … the dental office you manage, the family you feed and transport—this is your boat. Christ shoulder-taps us and reminds:\n“You drive my truck.”\n“You work on my job site.”\n“You serve my hospital wing.”\nTo us all, Jesus says, “Your work is my work.” ',
