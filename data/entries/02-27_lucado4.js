That sin separates you from God, and that sin must be punished. But because God loves you so much and because He doesn’t want to be separated from you, He chose to send Jesus to be punished instead of you.\nHe chose to forgive you and forget your sins. That is grace. ',

Are you the one who commands the eagle to fly (39:27)? It’s good to remember that God is God and we are not.'
