If you only see yourself—and what you want—then you will be just like the people Paul described in Philippians 3:19: “The way they live is leading them to destruction. Instead of serving God, they do whatever their bodies want.\nThey do shameful things, and they are proud of it. They think only about earthly things.”\nGod doesn’t want you only to see yourself. He wants you to see Jesus and to imitate Him. That means He wants you to do what Jesus would do.\nSeeing Jesus—and doing what He would do—is what Christianity is all about. Christian service—like helping the poor and being a friend to the friendless—is imitating Jesus. To see His love and power and kindness, and then to imitate Him, is the greatest kind of faith. ',
