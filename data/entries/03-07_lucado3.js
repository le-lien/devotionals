    "body": 'Here’s an idea. Get over yourself.\nMoses did. One of history’s foremost leaders was “a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth” (Numbers 12:3\nNIV). Mary did. When Jesus called her womb his home, she did not boast; she simply confessed: “I’m the Lord’s maid, ready to serve” (Luke 1:38\nMSG). Most of all, Jesus did. “Jesus … was given a position ‘a little lower than the angels’” (Hebrews 2:9 NLT).\nJesus chose the servants’ quarters. Can’t we? We’re important, but not essential. We have a part in the play, but we are not the main act. God is.\nHe did well before our birth; he’ll do fine after our deaths. He started it all, sustains it all, and will bring it all to a glorious end. In the meantime, we have this high honor: to give up personal goals, do what’s right even when there’s no reward, deal with problems that others avoid, say no to selfishness, follow Christ, and make his plans our own.

      "text": 'Sounds worse than chores, doesn’t it? Give up your goals. Forget about rewards. Take on the tough problems. A funny thing about that, though—the more you do it, the closer you grow to God, and the more joy that flows into your heart. Try it. Less you, more God adds up to delight.'
