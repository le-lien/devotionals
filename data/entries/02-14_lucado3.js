    "body": 'Aguy dates a girl for three months. She says she’s in love. He’s not sure, but he knows he feels different when he’s with her. He wonders if that’s love.\nMaybe you’ve wondered too.\nWant to know if you feel genuine love? Ask yourself this: Do I encourage this person to do what is right?  For true love “takes no pleasure in other people’s sins but delights in the truth” (1 Corinthians 13:6 TJB).\nHere’s an example. A young couple is on a date. His affection goes beyond her comfort zone. She resists. He tries the oldest line in the book:\n“But I love you. I just want to be near you. If you loved me …” That siren you hear? It’s the phony-love detector. This guy doesn’t love her. True love will never ask the “beloved” to do what he or she thinks is wrong.\nWant to know if your love for someone is true? If your friendship is genuine? Ask if you influence this person to do what is right. If you answer yes, ask her out for lunch. ',
