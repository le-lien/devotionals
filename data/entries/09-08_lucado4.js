You’re not afraid to speak in front of groups, you’re good at organization, and you’ve got an A+ in math. You are perfect for the job!”\nIt’s a tug-of-war, and you are the rope. Family life, church groups, homework, chores, sports, hobbies, friends—how do you choose who and what gets your time? Ask the One who created time how He wants you to spend your time. His answer might be something like this: Blessed are those who see the jobs God wants them to do. Blessed are those who know that there is only one God, that He is in charge and they have stopped trying to do His job. Blessed are those who ask Him what on earth  they are on earth to do—and they do it. ',
