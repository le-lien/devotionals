Your body will be different, but you won’t have a different body. You will have this one. Does that change the view you have of it? I hope so.\nGod has a high regard for your body. You should as well. Forget all those ads saying you need to be this size or wear this makeup. Just respect the body that God gave you. I did not say worship it. I did not say show it off to get the attention of others. But I did say respect it. It is after all the temple of God. Be careful how you feed it, use it, and maintain it. You wouldn’t want anyone trashing your home; God doesn’t want anyone trashing his. After all, it is his, isn’t it?\nONE MORE THOUGHT\nWhen you accept the idea that your body belongs to God, it changes things. ',
