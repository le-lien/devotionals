    "body": 'Some historians clump Christ with Moses, Muhammad, Confucius, and other spiritual leaders. But Jesus refuses to share the page. He declares, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, but by me”\n(John 14:6 RSV). He could have been politically correct and said, “I know the way,” or, “I show the way.” Yet he speaks of who he is: I am the way.\nMany flinch at this absolute. It sounds primitive in our era of broadbands and broad minds. The world is shrinking, cultures are blending, borders are bending; this is the day of inclusion. All roads lead to heaven, right?\nBut how can all religions lead to God when they are so different? We don’t tolerate such illogic in other matters. We don’t pretend that all roads lead to London or all ships sail to Australia.\nJesus cleared a one-of-a-kind passageway uncluttered by human effort.\nChrist came, not for the strong, but for the weak; not for the righteous, but for the sinner. We enter his way with the confession of our need, not the completion of our deeds. He dies and we live. He invites and we believe. ',
