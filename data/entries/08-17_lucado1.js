Only a temperamental god could be satisfied by sacrifices.\nOnly a heartless god would sell salvation to the highest bidders.\nAnd only a great God does for his children what they can’t do for themselves.\nGod’s delight is received upon surrender, not awarded upon conquest.\nThe first step to joy is a plea for help, an acknowledgment of moral destitution, an admission of inward paucity. Those who taste God’s presence have declared spiritual bankruptcy and are aware of their spiritual crisis… . Their pockets are empty. Their options are gone. They have long since stopped demanding justice; they are pleading for mercy. ',
