    "body": 'Look at Paul’s goal: to bring each one into God’s presence as a mature person in Christ. Paul dreamed of the day that each person would be safe in Christ. What was his way of doing this? Warning  and teaching others. What were Paul’s tools? Verbs. Nouns. Sentences. Lessons. The same tools that you and I have.\nWas it easier back then to teach others than it is now? I don’t think so.\nPaul called it work. “To do this, I work and struggle,” he wrote. Struggle means it was hard. Work  means homes visited, people taught, classes prepared.\nHow did Paul do it? What was his source of strength? It was Jesus “Christ’s great strength that works so powerfully in me.”\nAs Paul worked, so did God. And as you work, so does the Father. ',
