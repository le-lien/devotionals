    "body": 'Christine Caine was abandoned, unnamed, by the mother and father who conceived and bore her. Could anything be worse? Actually, yes. She was sexually abused by members of her new family. They turned her childhood into a horror story of one encounter after another. Twelve years of ugly evil.\nYet, what they intended for evil, God used for good. Christine chose to focus on the promise of her heavenly Father and not the hurts of her past.\nYears later, when she heard of the plight of girls caught in the sex-slave industry, she knew she had to respond. This unnamed, abused girl set out to rescue the nameless and abused girls of her day. Now she travels the world meeting with cabinets, presidents, and parliaments. Satan’s plan to destroy her actually strengthened her resolve to help others. With God as her helper, she will see sex slavery brought to its knees. 6\nNo evil is beyond God’s reach. He will make good out of your mess too.\nThat’s his job.\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
