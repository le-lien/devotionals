It is in your mind that you decide which seeds are planted in your heart and which seeds are thrown away. Which thoughts are worth hanging on to and which ones need to be weeded out. The Holy Spirit is ready to help you sort out all those thoughts that try to get in. He can help you guard your heart. ',

You “capture every thought and make it give up and obey Christ” (2 Corinthians 10:5). You don’t leave the door wide open and unguarded. You stand ready with handcuffs and leg irons, ready to capture any thought not good enough to enter.',
