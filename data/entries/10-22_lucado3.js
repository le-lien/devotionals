Or maybe your parents were gone and you spent an hour looking at Internet pictures you knew you shouldn’t see. You blew it and confessed to God. You realize he’s forgiven you, but you’re finding it hard to forgive yourself.\nWelcome to the Court of Shame. Look around. See anyone you know?\nRecognize that judge in the long black robe? It’s you. In fact the prosecutor looks pretty familiar. You again. Glance over to the jury. Yep. Twelve of you, all giving you the evil eye and saying, “Guilty.” When it comes to shame, we are our harshest judges.\nAfter hearing the heart of the woman having an affair, Jesus declared, “I also don’t judge you guilty. You may go now, but don’t sin anymore” (John 8:11 NCV). If Jesus judged her and found her not guilty, what do you think he says about you?\nAt times like this, you must ask yourself a question: who makes a better judge—you or Jesus? ',
