In countless situations— stressful meetings, dull days, long drives, demanding trips—\nand many times a day, I step to the underground spring of God. There I receive anew his work for my sin and death, the energy of his Spirit, his lordship, and his love.\nDrink with me from his bottomless well. You don’t have to live with a dehydrated heart.\nReceive Christ’s work on the cross, the e nergy of his Spirit,\nhis lordship over your life, his unending, unfailing love.\nDrink deeply and often. And out of you will flow rivers of living water. ',
