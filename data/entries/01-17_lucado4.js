    "body": 'Does Jesus care what clothes you wear?\nYes, He does! In fact, the Bible tells us exactly what kind of clothes God wants you to wear: “Clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ”\n(Romans 13:14).\nGod’s kind of clothing has nothing to do with jeans or shirts or dresses. It is your spiritual clothing that He cares about. Listen to what Isaiah says about God’s special clothing: “The Lord makes me very happy. . . . The Lord has covered me with clothes of salvation. He has covered me with a coat of goodness” (Isaiah 61:10).\nWhen you believe in God, He gives you a heavenly “coat of goodness.”\nYou can only get this coat from God, and it is only for His children. Unlike your winter coat, you will never outgrow it, and it will never wear out.\nGod’s “coat of goodness” is always a perfect fit. ',
