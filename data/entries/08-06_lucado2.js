    "body": 'The humble heart honors others.\nIs Jesus not our example? Content to be known as a carpenter. Happy to be mistaken for the gardener. He served his followers by washing their feet.\nHe serves us by doing the same. Each morning he gifts us with beauty. Each Sunday he calls us to his table. Each moment he dwells in our hearts. And does he not speak of the day when he as “the master will dress himself to serve and tell the servants to sit at the table, and he will serve them” (Luke 12:37)?\nIf Jesus is so willing to honor us, can we not do the same for others?\nMake people a priority. Accept your part in his plan. Be quick to share the applause. And, most of all, regard others as more important than yourself.\nLove does. For love “does not boast, it is not proud.” ',
