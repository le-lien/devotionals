    "body": 'The Holy City, John says, is like “a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.”\nWhat is more beautiful than a bride? …\nMaybe it is the aura of whiteness that clings to her as dew clings to a rose. Or perhaps it is the diamonds that glisten in her eyes. Or maybe it’s the blush of love that pinks her cheeks or the bouquet of promises she carries.\nA bride. A commitment robed in elegance. “I’ll be with you forever.”\nTomorrow bringing hope today. Promised purity faithfully delivered.\nWhen you read that our heavenly home is similar to a bride, tell me, doesn’t it make you want to go home? ',
