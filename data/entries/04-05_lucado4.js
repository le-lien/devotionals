We don’t know how to pray.\nWorship can be confusing.\nThat’s why God gave us Psalms: to help us worship Him. It is a praise book for God’s people. And although the psalms talk about many different things, they each have the same purpose: to draw us closer to the heart of God.\nSome psalms are bold. Others are humble. Some are to be sung. Others are to be prayed. Some seem written just for you alone. Others seem to be for the whole world to sing. ',
