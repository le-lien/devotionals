    "body": '[Does] Jesus care what clothes we wear?\nApparently so. In fact, the Bible tells us exactly the wardrobe God desires.\n“But clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ and forget about satisfying your sinful self” (Rom. 13:14).\n“You were all baptized into Christ, and so you were all clothed with Christ. This means that you are all children of God through faith in Christ Jesus” (Gal. 3:26–27).\nThis clothing has nothing to do with dresses and jeans and suits. God’s concern is with our spiritual garment. He offers a heavenly robe that only heaven can see and only heaven can give. Listen to the words of Isaiah:\n“The LORD makes me very happy; all that I am rejoices in my God. He has covered me with clothes of salvation and wrapped me with a coat of goodness”(Isa. 61:10). ',
