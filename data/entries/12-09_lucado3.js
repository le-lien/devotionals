        "body": 'Once there were a couple of farmers who couldn’t get along with each other. A wide ravine separated their two farms, but as a sign of their mutual distaste for each other, each constructed a fence on his side of the gulch to keep the other out.\nIn time, however, the daughter of one met the son of the other, and the couple fell in love. Determined not to be kept apart by their foolish fathers, they tore down the fences and used the wood to build a bridge across the ravine.\nConfession does that. Confessed sin becomes the bridge that allows us to walk back into the presence of God. Is there a ravine in your relationship with God? Are you keeping anything from him? Bad behavior? Bad attitude?\nDishonesty? Doubt?\nTell God about it right now. Tear down the fences. Build a bridge back to him.',
