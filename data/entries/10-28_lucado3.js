Both tried to deceive the church and God, and both apparently died because of it.\nMore than once I’ve heard people refer to that story with a nervous chuckle and say, “I’m glad God doesn’t still strike people dead for lying.” I’m not so sure he doesn’t.\nIt seems to me that the result of deceit is still death. Not death of the body, perhaps, but death all the same. Relationships (falsehoods are termites in the walls of any marriage or friendship). A conscience (the tragedy of the second lie is that it’s always easier to tell than the first). A career (just ask the grad student who got booted out for cheating if the lie wasn’t fatal).\nWe could also list the deaths of intimacy, trust, peace, credibility, and self-respect. But perhaps the most tragic death caused by our lying is when it happens to our statements about Jesus. The court won’t listen to the testimony of a lying witness. Neither will the world.\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
