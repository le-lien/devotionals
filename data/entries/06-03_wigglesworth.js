Express your deep-P est feelings to Him:\n\nHe knows it all, He knows it all,\n\nMy Father knows, He knows it all,\n\nThe bitter tears, how fast they fall,\n\nHe knows, my Father knows it all. Sorrow may come at night, but “joy comes in the morning” (Ps. 30:5). So many believers never look up. When Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead, He lifted His eyes and said, “Father, I thank You that You have heard Me”  (John 11:41). God wants us to have a resurrection touch about us. Never use your human plan when God speaks His Word. You have your cue from an almighty Source whose resources never fade away. His treasury is past measuring, abounding with extravagances of abundance, waiting to be poured out upon us.\n\nHear what the Scripture says, “God…gives to all liberally and without reproach”  (James 1:5). The almighty hand of God comes to our weakness and says, "If you will dare to trust Me and not doubt, I will abundantly satisfy you from the treasure house of the Most High." He forgives, He supplies, He opens the door into His fullness and makes us know that He has done it all. When you come to Him, He gives you an overflow without measure, an expression of a Father‘s love.\n\nHe can satisfy every need. He satisfies the hungry with good things (Luke 1:53). Will you cast “all your care upon Him, for He cares for you”  (1 Pet. 5:7)? God will help us. Glory to God. How He meets the needs of the hungry!',
