You’ll never meet anyone who has your exact blend of loves and longings.\nThis life of yours is racing, and if you aren’t careful, you’ll look up and see it passing you by. Some people don’t bother with such thoughts. They grind through their days without lifting their eyes to look. They live and die and never ask why. But you aren’t numbered among them. It’s not enough for you to do well. You want to do good. You want your life to matter. You want to live in such a way that the world will be glad you did.\nWe are each given an opportunity to make a big difference during a difficult time. What if we did? What if we rocked the world with hope? Filled all corners with God’s love and life?\nWe are created by a great God to do great works. ',
