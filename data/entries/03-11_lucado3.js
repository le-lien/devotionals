Oh, maybe you kept statistics for your basketball team or handed out assignments for English class, but that’s about it. You’ve never won much.\nYou’ve watched the LeBron Jameses of this world carry home the trophies and walk away with the ribbons. All you have are “almosts” and “what ifs.”\nIf that hits home, then you’ll value this promise: “And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away” (1 Peter 5:4 NIV).\nYour day is coming. God has plans to honor you, to give you a reward that will last not for a season but for eternity. Nothing has more value than a crown from his kingdom. What the world has overlooked, your Father has remembered, and sooner than you can imagine, you will be blessed by him. ',
