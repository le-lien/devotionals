Maybe you wanted to make the team, get a part in the play, or take a special vacation. Finally, you got to do it. And it was great! … For a while. Why didn’t your happiness last forever?\nWhy? Because the happiness and joys of this world don’t last forever.\nBecause they aren’t true joy. True joy—the kind that lasts forever, through good times and bad—comes only from God.\nTrue joy doesn’t come from getting to do things; it comes from admitting that there are some things you can’t do—like forgive your own sins or save yourself.

      "title": 'It’s kind of funny. In this world, admitting that you can’t  do something doesn’t usually lead to joy. Confessing mistakes isn’t ordinarily followed by total forgiveness. But then again, God is not known for being ordinary. And the joy that He wants to give you? It isn’t ordinary either.',
      "text": 'Growing in Grace As the new year approaches, many people start making goals. Things like exercise more, eat better, or make better grades. Think about your spiritual goals for the year. Make one of them to find a little bit of God’s joy in every day.'
