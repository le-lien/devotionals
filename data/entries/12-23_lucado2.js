    "body": '“Love,” Paul says, “never fails.”\nThe verb Paul uses for the word fail is used elsewhere to describe the demise of a flower as it falls to the ground, withers, and decays. It carries the meaning of death and abolishment. God’s love, says the apostle, will never fall to the ground, wither, and decay. By its nature, it is permanent. It is never abolished.\nLove “will last forever” (NLT).\nIt “never dies” (MSG).\nIt “never ends” (RSV).\nLove “is eternal” (TEV).\nGod’s love “will never come to an end” (NEB)...\nGovernments will fail, but God’s love will last. Crowns are temporary, but love is eternal. Your money will run out, but his love never will. ',
