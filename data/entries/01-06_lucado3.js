Parents shift between understanding and criticizing. Not God. With him “there is no variation or shadow due to change” (James 1:17 ESV).\nCatch God in a bad mood? Won’t happen. Scared you might use up all his grace? Think he’s given up on you? Wrong. Did he not make a promise to you? “God is not a human being, and he will not lie. He is not a human, and he does not change his mind. What he says he will do, he does. What he promises, he makes come true” (Numbers 23:19 NCV). He’s never sullen or sour, sulking or stressed. His strength, truth, ways, and love never change. He is “the same yesterday and today and forever” (Hebrews 13:8 ESV).\nThe resurrection of Jesus will not lose its power. The blood of Christ will not fade in strength. God never changes. You can count on it. ',

      "text": 'Change is exciting. Yet when everything around you is changing—your friends, classes, family, school, body, dreams—sometimes it’s nice to know someone stable, someone you can depend on. And when that someone happens to be the all-powerful Creator of the universe, overflowing with love for you? That’s exciting.'
