Your body will be different, but you won’t have a different body. You will have this one. It will be made new and perfect, but it will be the same one. Does that change the view you have of your body? I hope so.\nGod created your body, and He loves His creation. You should as well.\nRespect your body. I did not say worship it, but I did say respect it. After all, the Bible tells us that the human body is the temple of God—the place where the Holy Spirit of God lives. Be careful how you feed it, use it, and take care of it. You wouldn’t want anyone trashing your home, would you?\nWell, God doesn’t want anyone trashing His either. After all, it is His temple, isn’t it? ',
