    "body": 'During the early days of the Civil War, a Union soldier was arrested for sneaking away and leaving the army. Unable to prove that he was innocent, he was sentenced to die. His plea for mercy found its way to the desk of President Abraham Lincoln. The president felt sorry for the soldier and signed a pardon. The soldier returned to service, fought the rest of the war, and was killed in the last battle. After his death, the signed letter from the president was found inside his shirt pocket.\nClose to the heart of the soldier were his leader’s words of pardon. The soldier found courage in the grace of the president.\nBut we have an even greater pardon from an even greater Leader—the pardon of all our sins from our heavenly King. Let God’s grace give you the courage to do the right thing. ',

Write down these words from 1 John 1:9, and then tuck them in your backpack or purse: “If we confess our sins, [God] will forgive our sins. We can trust God. He does what is right. He will make us clean from all the wrongs we have done.”'
