    "body": 'ne day I went out of my house and saw a friend of mine named John who lived opposite me. He crossed the road, O came up to me, and said, "Now, Smith, how are you?"\n\n"Very well, John," I said.\n\n"Well," he said, "my wife and I have been praying and talking together about selling our house, and every time we think about it in any way, your name is the only one we think about."\n\nThat was a strange thing to me.\n\n"Will you buy it?" he asked.\n\nNow, if you remember, when David went wrong he only went wrong because he violated the holy communion and knowledge of what kept him. What was it? What was the word that would have saved him? “You shall not covet your neighbor‟s wife”  (Exod. 20:17). He had to break that law to commit sin.\n\nI was not dealing with a sin; however, looking back, I see that there were many questionable things about the situation, so that if I had thought about it for a moment, I would have been saved from many weeks of brokenheartedness and sorrow.\n\nWhat was the first thing that I should have asked myself? "Can I live in two houses? No. Well, then, one is sufficient."\n\nThe next thing was, "Do I have the money to buy the house? No."\n\nThat is sufficient in itself, for God does not want any person to be in debt, and when you learn that secret, it will save you from many sleepless nights. But I was like many people; we are all learning, and none of us is perfect. However, I do thank God that we are called to perfection, whether we come into it at once or not. If you miss the mark of holiness ten times a day, fortify yourself to believe that God intends for you to be holy, and then stand again.',
