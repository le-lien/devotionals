    "body": 'How did Jesus endure the terror of the crucifixion? He went first to the Father with his fears. He modeled the words of Psalm 56:3: “When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.”\nDo the same with yours. Don’t avoid life’s Gardens of Gethsemane.\nEnter them. Just don’t enter them alone. And while there, be honest.\nPounding the ground is permitted. Tears are allowed. And if you sweat blood, you won’t be the first. Do what Jesus did; open your heart.\nAnd be specific. Jesus was. “Take this cup,” he prayed. Give God the number of the flight. Tell him the length of the speech. Share the details of the job transfer. He has plenty of time. He also has plenty of compassion.\nHe doesn’t think your fears are foolish or silly. He won’t tell you to\n“buck up” or “get tough.” He’s been where you are. He knows how you feel.\nAnd he knows what you need. ',
