Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits.\n(Psalm 103:1–2)\nHere we observe David’s spirit telling his soul what to do.\nDavid’s spirit knew what ought to be done, but it could not happen until David’s soul cooperated with his spirit and responded to the challenge.\nLet’s briefly enumerate the benefits that we are cautioned not to forget. Many Christians do not enjoy these benefits because they fail to remember them. Six specific benefits of God are listed in the next three verses:\nWho forgives all your iniquities, who heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from destruction, who crowns you with lovingkindness and tender mercies, who satisfies your mouth with good things, so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.\n(verses 3–5)\nGod forgives all our iniquities, heals all our diseases, redeems our lives from destruction, crowns us with lovingkindness and tender mercies, satisfies our mouths with good things, and renews our youth like the eagle’s. I believe there is a close connection between having your mouth filled with good things and having your youth renewed like the eagle’s.\nI am convinced that it is not the will of God for His people to grow old the way the world grows old. I do not mean that there will not be any change produced by advancing in age, but that aging does not need to be a time of failure, misery, and sickness. ',
