I took a seat when I should have taken a stand.\nIf this were the first time, it would be different. But it isn’t. How many times can one fall and expect to be caught? …\nYour eyes look in the mirror and see a sinner, a failure, a promise-breaker. But by faith you look in the mirror and see a robed prodigal bearing the ring of grace on your finger and the kiss of your Father on your face… .\nYour eyes see your faults. Your faith sees your Savior.\nYour eyes see your guilt. Your faith sees his blood. ',
