He met their most basic need: He filled their bellies.\nEach morning the manna came. Each evening the quail appeared. “Trust me. Trust me and I will give you what you need.” The people were told to take just enough for one day. Their needs would be met, one day at a time.\n“Just take enough for today,” was God’s message. “Let me worry about tomorrow.”\nThe Father wanted the people to trust him. ',
