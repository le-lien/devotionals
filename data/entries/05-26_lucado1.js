    "body": '“Everything that was written in the past was written to teach us,”\nPaul penned. “The Scriptures give us patience and encouragement so that we can have hope” (Rom. 15:4).\nThese are not just Sunday school stories. Not romantic fables… . They are historical moments in which a real God met real pain so we could answer the question, “Where is God when I hurt?”\nHow does God react to dashed hopes? Read the story of Jairus. How does the Father feel about those who are ill? Stand with him at the pool of Bethesda. Do you long for God to speak to your lonely heart? Then listen as he speaks to the Emmaus-bound disciples… .\nHe’s not doing it just for them. He’s doing it for me. He’s doing it for you… .\nThe God who spoke still speaks… . The God who came still comes. He comes into our world. He comes into your world. He comes to do what you can’t. ',
