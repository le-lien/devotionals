    "body": 'How could you not have all that you need when your Savior has promised not to withhold any good thing from you?\nNeed—it’s a very interesting word. It’s one of the most frequently used words in human culture and one of the words used most sloppily. We use it to refer to a vast and ever-expanding category that includes all the things that we become convinced that we just can’t live without. Most of us think of ourselves as needy in some way, and most of us worry that our needs will never be met. And we all have those moments when we wonder if God really does know what we need and really is committed to providing it. It’s tempting to look over the fences at the lives of others and conclude that their needs have been met, which leads us to wonder why ours haven’t. Yes, need is an interesting and troubling word.\nThe problem is that, if need means “essential for life,” most of the things we load into our need category aren’t really needs. They are actually desires that have become so precious and important to us that we have come to the point that we cannot conceive of being happy without them. At this point, they capture our thoughts, direct our desires, shape the way we think about our lives, and ultimately define how we think about God.\nHere are three things that happen when you name something a need: 1. If you are convinced that something is a need, you feel entitled to it. This means you are sure it is your right to have it in your life.\n2. If you are convinced something is a need, you think that it’s your right to demand it. You do not feel uncomfortable about asking for it again and again.\n3. If you are convinced that something is a need, you judge the love of God by his willingness to deliver it.\nThis is the scary pathway down which this concept of “need” leads you. If you’re convinced something is a need and God does not deliver it, you begin to question his goodness. What is deadly about questioning God’s goodness is that you tend not to run for help to someone you doubt. Misnamed “needs” can be\ndevastating to your communion with God. I am persuaded that many people struggle with doubts about the goodness and faithfulness of God for this very reason. They cannot believe that God would fail to deliver a thing that seems impossible for them to live without. God hasn’t promised to deliver what you desire, but he has committed himself to meet every one of your needs. That’s why it’s so comforting to know that you have a heavenly Father who knows exactly what you need and is actively delivering.\nFor further study and encouragement: Psalm 84:11 and Matthew 6:25–',
