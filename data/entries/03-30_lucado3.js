The computer takes too darn long to boot up!\nIf patience is hard for you, you might ask this question: How filled are you with God’s patience? You’ve heard about it from your parents. Studied it at a Sunday school class. Maybe underlined Bible verses about it. But have you received it? The proof is in your patience. Patience that is deeply received results in patience that is freely offered.\nGod does more than demand patience from us; he offers it to us. Patience is a fruit of his Spirit. It hangs from the tree of Galatians 5:22: “The Spirit produces the fruit of love, joy, peace, patience” (NCV). Have you asked God to give you some fruit? Well, I did once, but . . . But what? Did you, ahem, grow impatient? Ask him again and again and again. He won’t grow impatient with your pleading, and you will receive patience in your praying.\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
