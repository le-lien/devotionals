Too tired to continue? He’ll carry you. Too discouraged to fight? He’s picking you up. God is for you.\nGod is for you. Had he a calendar, your birthday would be circled. If he drove a car, your name would be on his bumper. If there’s a tree in heaven, he’s carved your name in the bark.\n“Can a mother forget her nursing child?” God asks in Isaiah 49:15 (NLT).\nWhat a bizarre question. Can you imagine your mother feeding you when you’re an infant and then later asking, “What was that baby’s name?” No. I’ve seen mothers care for their young. They stroke the hair, touch the face, sing the name over and over. Can a mother forget? No way. And God says, “Even if she could forget, … I will not forget you” (Isaiah 49:15 NCV). ',
