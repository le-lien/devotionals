    "body": 's it possible, after we have been baptized with the Holy Spirit, to be satisfied with what we see? What made Jesus weep I over Jerusalem? He had a heart of compassion. There are sin-sick souls everywhere. We need a baptism of love that goes to the bottom of the disease. We need to cry to God until He brings us up to the “measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ”  (Eph. 4:13).\n\nJesus told a parable about “a certain man [who] went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves”  (Luke 10:30). Who among those who passed by and saw his predicament was his neighbor? The one who had mercy on him and helped him (vv. 36– 37). Are you awake to the great fact that God has given you eternal life? With the power God has put at your disposal, how can you rest as you look out upon your neighbors? How we have sinned against God! How we lack this spirit of compassion! Do we weep as we look out upon the unsaved? If not, we are not Pentecost-full. Jesus was moved with compassion. Are you?\n\nWe have not yet grasped the plight of the heathen. Since my only daughter went to Africa, I have a little less dim idea of what it meant that God so loved the world that He gave Jesus (John 3:16). God gave Jesus. What does that mean? Compassion. “You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you”  (Acts 1:8). If you have no power, you have not repented. You say, "That‘s hard language." It is truth.\n\nWho is your brother‘s keeper? (See Genesis 4:9.) Who is the son and heir? (See Galatians 4:7.) Are you salted? (See Matthew 5:13.) Do you have a pure life? Don‘t be fooled; don‘t live in a false position. The world wants to know how to be saved, and power is at our disposal. Will we meet the conditions? God says, "If you will, I will." God will do it.\n\nDaniel knew the time in which he was living; he responded to God, and a nation was saved. Nehemiah met God‘s conditions for 455\n\nhis time, and the city was rebuilt. God has made the conditions. He will pour out His Spirit.\n\nIf we do not go on, we will have it to face. It may be up to us to bring the Gospel to the nations. We can win the world for Jesus. We can turn the tap on. What is the condition? It is unconditional surrender. “„Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,‟ says the LORD of hosts”  (Zech. 4:6). Depart from sin; holiness opens the windows of heaven. The Spirit of God will be poured out without measure, until the people say, “What must [we] do to be saved?” (Acts 16:30).',
