Does any of it matter to God?\nGod has ordained your work as something good. Before he gave Adam a wife or a child, even before he gave Adam britches, God gave Adam a job.\n“Then the LORD God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to cultivate it and keep it” (Genesis 2:15 NASB). God calls all the physically able to till the gardens he gives. He honors work. So honor God in your work.\n“And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him” (Colossians 3:17\nNIV).\nWhatever you do!  Do it as if Jesus is grading your report or autographing your project. Then give thanks to God for the tasks he gives you and the opportunity to make a difference in the world. Even if it’s by washing dishes.\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
