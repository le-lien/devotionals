    "body": 'A legend from India tells about a mouse who was terrified of cats until a magician agreed to transform him into a cat. That resolved his fear . .\n. until he met a dog, so the magician changed him into a dog. The mouse-turned-cat-turned-dog was content until he met a tiger—so, once again, the magician changed him into what he feared. But when the tiger came complaining that he had met a hunter, the magician refused to help. “I will make you into a mouse again, for though you have the body of a tiger, you still have the heart of a mouse.”\nSound familiar? How many people do you know who have built a formidable exterior, only to tremble inside with fear? … We face our fears with force … or … we stockpile wealth. We seek security in things. We cultivate fame and seek status.\nBut do these approaches work?\nCourage is an outgrowth of who we are. Exterior supports may temporarily sustain, but only inward character creates courage. ',
