    "body": 'When his accusers called him a servant of Satan, Jesus demanded to see their evidence. “Which one of you convicts Me of sin?” he dared (John 8:46\nNASB). Ask my circle of friends to point out my sin, and watch the hands shoot up. When those who knew Jesus were asked this same question, no one spoke. Christ was followed by disciples, analyzed by crowds, criticized by family, and scrutinized by enemies, yet not one person would remember him committing even one sin. He was never found in the wrong place.\nNever said the wrong word. Never acted the wrong way. He never sinned.\nNot that he wasn’t tempted, mind you. He was “tempted in every way that we are, but he did not sin.”\nLust wooed him. Greed lured him. Power called him. Jesus—the human\n—was tempted. But Jesus—the holy God—resisted. ',
