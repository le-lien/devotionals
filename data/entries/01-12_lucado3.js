    "body": 'Someone once said to me, “I’m a new Christian. Over the years I’ve developed some bad habits. How do I get rid of them now?” My answer to him then and advice to you now? Develop good habits. Here are four to start with.\nFirst, pray: “Steadfastly maintain the <i>habit</i> of prayer” (Romans 12:12\nPHILLIPS). God wants to hear from you daily. Second, study: “The man who looks into the perfect mirror of God’s law ... and makes a <i>habit</i> of so doing, is not the man who sees and forgets” (James 1:25 PHILLIPS).\nThird, give: “On <i>every</i> Lord’s Day each of you should put aside something from what you have earned during the week, and use it for this offering” (1 Corinthians 16:2 TLB). You don’t give for God’s sake, but for yours. And last of all, fellowship: “Let us not give up the <i>habit</i> of meeting together” (Hebrews 10:25 GNT). You need support every week from other Christians.\nFour habits worth having. Isn’t it good to know that some habits are good for you?',
