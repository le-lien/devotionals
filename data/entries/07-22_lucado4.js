His list probably goes something like this: “If only he knew how much I love him … If only she would ask for My help … If only he would trust Me … If only she would let Me save her …”\nThere are a lot of “if only” things that you can’t do anything about. But you can choose to do something about God’s “if only” list. You can choose to believe in Him and to obey His Word—and you can make God’s “if onlys” come true. ',
