    "body": 'was healed of appendicitis, because of faith based on the knowledge of the experience of faith. When I have minis-I tered to others, God has met and answered according to His will. We know that God will not fail us when we believe and trust in His power. The centurion had this faith when he said to Jesus, “Speak a word, and my servant will be healed”  (Matt. 8:8). Jesus answered him, “„Go your way; and as you have believed, so let it be done for you.‟ And his servant was healed that same hour”  (v. 13).\n\nIn one place where I was staying, a young man came in telling us that his sweetheart was dying; there was no hope. I said, "Only believe." This was faith based on knowledge. I knew that what God had done for me He could do for her. We went to the house. Her sufferings were terrible to witness. I said, "In the name of Jesus, come out of her." She cried, "Mother, Mother, I am well." Then I said that the only way to make us believe it was for her to get up and dress. Soon she came down dressed. The doctor came in and examined her carefully. He said, "This is of God; this is the finger of God." It was faith based on knowledge.\n\nIf I were to receive a check for a thousand pounds and knew only imperfectly the character of the man who sent it, I would be careful of him. I would not rely on the money until the check was honored. Jesus, on the other hand, did great works because of His knowledge of His Father. He knew He could count on the character of God. Faith begets knowledge, fellowship, and communion. If you see imperfect faith, full of doubt, a wavering condition, it always comes because of imperfect knowledge.',
