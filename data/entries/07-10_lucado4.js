Why did God make me?”\nSome people search for the answer in their work. These people believe that who they are is what they do, so they do a lot. “I am here to be an A+\nstudent.” That’s a great goal, but not exactly a reason for living.\nFor other people, who they are is what they have. They find meaning in the right clothes, right house, right toys. They believe their reason for being here is tied to the things they own. Others try to have all the fun they possibly can, and still others try to be the sports star or the movie star.\nBut none of these things are the right answer to the question “Why am I here?” We only have one purpose in life. One reason for being here. To praise God. ',

Now try to live so that people will say those same things about you. That’s the kind of life that will praise God.'
