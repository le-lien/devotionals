They took a heart-stopping memory of a man who called himself no less than God in the flesh. And they couldn’t get him out of their minds. Try as they might to lose him in the crowd, they couldn’t forget him.\nIf they saw a leper, they thought of his compassion.\nIf they heard a storm, they would remember the day he silenced one.\nIf they saw a child, they would think of the day he held one.\nAnd if they saw a lamb being carried to the temple, they would remember his face streaked with blood and his eyes flooded with love.\nNo, they couldn’t forget him. As a result, they came back. And, as a result, the church of our Lord began with a group of frightened men in an upper room. ',
