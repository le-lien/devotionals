    "body": 'For thirty-three years he would feel everything you and I have ever felt.\nHe felt weak. He grew weary. He was afraid of failure. He was susceptible to wooing women. He got colds, burped, and had body odor. His feelings got hurt.\nTo think of Jesus in such a light is—well, it seems almost irreverent, doesn’t it? It’s not something we like to do; it’s uncomfortable. It is much easier to keep the humanity out of the incarnation. Clean the manure from around the manger. Wipe the sweat out of his eyes. Pretend he never snored or blew his nose or hit his thumb with a hammer.\nHe’s easier to stomach that way. There is something about keeping him divine that keeps him distant, packaged, predictable.\nBut don’t do it. For heaven’s sake, don’t. Let him be as human as he intended to be. Let him into the mire and muck of our world. For only if we let him in can he pull us out.\nGod Came Near\nNovember\nThose who give up their lives\nwill save them. ',
