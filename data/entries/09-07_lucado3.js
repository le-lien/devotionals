    "body": 'You stayed when you should have gone, looked when you should have turned, flirted when you should have walked away, hurt when you should have helped, denied when you should have confessed. So talk to God about it.\nGo to him as you would go to a trusted family member. Explain the pain, and revisit your mistake together.\nWhen you mess up and fess up, God may send you to talk to another Christian. “Confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another so that you may be healed” (James 5:16 NASB). James calls us not only to confess up to God but also to confess out to each other.\nPeople are attracted to honesty. You should be too. Find a Bible study or youth group with guys and gals that believe in fessing up. Avoid gatherings where everyone claims to be perfect—you won’t fit in there anyway. Instead, hang out where people admit their sins and show humility. Healing happens in places like this.\nConfessors find a freedom that deniers don’t. ',
