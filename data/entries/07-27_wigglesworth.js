    "body": 're you ready? "Why?" you ask. Because God wants to give us higher ground, holier thoughts, and a more concen-A trated, clearer ministry. God wants us to be in a rising tide every day. This rising tide is a changing of faith; it is an attitude of the spirit where God rises higher and higher. He wants us to come to the place where we will never look back. God has no room for the person who looks back. (See Genesis 19:15–26.) The Holy Spirit wants to get you ready to stretch yourself out to God and to believe that “He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him”  (Heb. 11:6). You do not need to use vain repetitions when you pray (Matt. 6:7). Simply ask and believe.\n\nPeople come with their needs, they ask, and then they leave with their needs because they do not faithfully wait to receive what God has promised them. If they ask for it, they will get it.\n\nMany people are missing the highest order. I went to a person who was full of the Spirit but was constantly saying, "Glory! Glory! Glory!" I said, "You are full of the Holy Spirit, but the Spirit cannot speak because you continually speak." He kept still then, and the Spirit began to speak through him. This story illustrates the fact that often we are altogether in God‘s way.\n\nI want to so change your operation in God that you will know that God is operating through you for this time and forevermore. May the Spirit awaken us to deep things today.\n\nAre you ready to move and be moved by the mighty power of God that cannot be moved, and to be so chastened and built up that you are in the place where it doesn‘t matter where the wind blows or what difficulty comes because you are fixed in God?\n\nAre you ready to come into the plan of the Most High God, believing what the Scriptures say and holding fast to what is good, believing so that no one will take your crown (Rev. 3:11)?',
