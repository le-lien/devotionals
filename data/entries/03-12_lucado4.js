    "body": 'Before Jesus comes into our lives, we may snap at our brothers and sisters or be selfish with our allowances. Maybe we are slow to obey our parents and teachers. Maybe we don’t even know what a mess we are until He comes into our lives.\nBut then Jesus moves in, and things begin to change. The careless, mean words we throw around are thrown away. The selfishness that clutters up our hearts is cleaned out. Oh, we’ll still mess up once in a while. We still might say a wrong word or do a wrong thing. But for the most part Jesus puts our lives in order. ',

Paul says it this way: “In the past you were slaves to sin—sin controlled you. But thank God, you fully obeyed the things that were taught to you. You were made free from sin, and now you are slaves to goodness” (Romans 6:17–18).',
      "text": 'Growing in Grace Next time you clean your room, clean up your heart too. As you throw out the trash, toss out any anger or jealousy. Clean up the closet and clean out your thoughts. Sweep up the floors as you ask God to sweep away your sins.'
