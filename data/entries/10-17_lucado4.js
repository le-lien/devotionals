Help someone in need, and Jesus smiles. Sing God’s praises, and the angels hum along. Just let a child call out in prayer, and the Father bends to listen. And, most important, let a sinner be saved and everything stops—all of heaven celebrates.\nWe aren’t always that happy, are we? When you hear about someone becoming a Christian, do you stop everything and celebrate? Is your good day made better or your bad day turned around? Maybe the news makes you happy—but do you celebrate?\nWhen someone becomes a Christian, the heart of Jesus explodes with joy like fireworks on the Fourth of July. Shouldn’t our hearts do the same? ',
