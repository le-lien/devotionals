    "body": 'Have bad things really happened to you? You and God may have different definitions for the word bad. Parents and children do. Look up the word bad in a middle-schooler’s dictionary, and you’ll read definitions such as “pimple on nose,” or “pop quiz in geometry.” “Dad, this is really bad!”\nthe youngster says. Dad, having been around the block a time or two, thinks differently. Pimples pass… .\nWhat you and I might rate as an absolute disaster, God may rate as a pimple-level problem that will pass. He views your life the way you view a movie after you’ve read the book. When something bad happens, you feel the air sucked out of the theater. Everyone else gasps at the crisis on the screen. Not you. Why? You’ve read the book. You know how the good guy gets out of the tight spot. God views your life with the same confidence.\nHe’s not only read your story … he wrote it. ',
