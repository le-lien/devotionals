The thought that the King of the universe would sneeze and burp and get bit by mosquitoes. . . . It’s too incredible. Too revolutionary. We would never create such a Savior. We aren’t that daring.\nWhen we create a redeemer, we keep him safely distant in his faraway castle. We allow him only the briefest of encounters with us. We permit him to swoop in and out with his sleigh before we can draw too near. We wouldn’t ask him to take up residence in the midst of a contaminated people. In our wildest imaginings we wouldn’t conjure a king who becomes one of us.\nBut God did. ',
