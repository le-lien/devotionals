    "body": 'God didn’t say, “If you have many kinds of troubles” … he said, “When you have many kinds of troubles . . .” Troubles are part of the package.\nBetrayals are part of our troubles. Don’t be surprised when betrayals come.\nDon’t look for fairness here—look instead where Jesus looked.\nWhile going through hell, Jesus kept his eyes on heaven. While surrounded by enemies he kept his mind on his father. While abandoned on earth, he kept his heart on home. “In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of God, the Powerful One, and coming on clouds in the sky” (Matt. 26:64).\nWhen all of earth turns against you, all of heaven turns toward you. To keep your balance in a crooked world, … think of home. ',
