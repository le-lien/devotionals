His love will cover that. The years you peddled prejudice and pride? His love will cover that.\nEvery promise broken, drug taken, penny stolen. Every cross word, cuss word, and harsh word. His love covers all things.\nLet it. Discover along with the psalmist: “He … loads me with love and mercy.” Picture a giant dump truck full of love. There you are behind it.\nGod lifts the bed until the love starts to slide. Slowly at first, then down, down, down until you are hidden, buried, covered in his love.\n“Hey, where are you?” someone asks.\n“In here, covered in love.” ',
