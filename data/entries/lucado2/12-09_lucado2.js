    "body": 'At first glance the standard in that verse seems impossible to meet.\nNothing? We shouldn’t do anything for ourselves? No new dress or suit.\nWhat about going to school or saving money—couldn’t all of these things be considered selfish?\nThey could, unless we are careful to understand what Paul is saying. The word the apostle uses for selfishness shares a root form with the words strife and contentious. It suggests a self-preoccupation that hurts others. A divisive arrogance. In fact, first-century writers used the word to describe a politician who procured office by illegal manipulation or a harlot who seduced the client, demeaning both herself and him… .\nLooking after your personal interests is proper life management. Doing so to the exclusion of the rest of the world is selfishness. ',
