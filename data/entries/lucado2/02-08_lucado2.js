    "body": 'How often do we thank God for his kindness? Not often enough. But does our ingratitude restrict his kindness? No. “Because he is kind even to people who are ungrateful and full of sin.”\nIn the original language, the word for kindness carries an added idea the English word does not. Chiefly it refers to an act of grace. But it also refers to a deed or person who is “useful, serviceable, adapted to its purpose.”\nKindness was even employed to describe food that was tasty as well as healthy. Sounds odd to our ears. “Hey, honey, what a great meal. The salad is especially kind tonight.”\nBut the usage makes sense. Isn’t kindness good and good for you?\nPleasant and practical? Kindness not only says “good morning,” kindness makes the coffee. ',
