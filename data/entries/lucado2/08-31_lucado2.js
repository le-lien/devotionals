Don’t march into battle with the enemy without first claiming the courage from God’s promises. May I give you a few examples?\nWhen you are confused: “‘I know what I am planning for you,’ says the Lord. ‘I have good plans for you, not plans to hurt you’” (Jer. 29:11 NCV).\nIf you feel weighted by yesterday’s failures: “So now, those who are in Christ Jesus are not judged guilty” (Rom. 8:1 NCV).\nOn those nights when you wonder where God is: “I am the Holy One, and I am among you” (Hos. 11:9 NCV).\nAnd the Angels Were Silent\nSeptember\nGod commands: …\nthat we love each other.
