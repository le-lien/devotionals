    "body": 'Perhaps you’ve seen Holman Hunt’s painting of Jesus. Stone archway …\nivycovered bricks … Jesus standing before a heavy wooden door.\nIt was in a Bible I often held as a young boy. Beneath the painting were the words, “Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him.”\nYears later I read about a surprise in the painting. Holman Hunt had intentionally left out something that only the most careful eye would note as missing. I had not noticed it. When I was told about it I went back and looked. Sure enough, it wasn’t there. There was no doorknob on the door. It could be opened only from the inside… .\nGod comes to your house, steps up to the door, and knocks. But it’s up to you to let him in. ',
