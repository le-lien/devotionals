And we who’ve been resurrected from the dead say, “Well, things could be better.” Or “Couldn’t get a parking place.”\nOr “My parents won’t let me move to Hawaii.” Or “People won’t leave me alone so I can finish my sermon on selfishness.” …\nAre you so focused on what you don’t have that you are blind to what you do?\nYou have a ticket to heaven no thief can take, an eternal home no divorce can break.\nEvery sin of your life has been cast to the sea.\nEvery mistake you’ve made is nailed to the tree.\nYou’re blood-bought and heaven-made.\nA child of God—forever saved.\nSo be grateful, joyful—for isn’t it true?\nWhat you don’t have is much less than what you do.
