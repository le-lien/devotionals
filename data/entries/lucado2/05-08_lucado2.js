    "body": 'Jesus blasts the top birds of the church, those who roost at the top of the spiritual ladder and spread their plumes of robes, titles, jewelry, and choice seats. Jesus won’t stand for it. It’s easy to see why. How can I love others if my eyes are only on me? How can I point to God if I’m pointing at me?\nAnd, worse still, how can someone see God if I keep fanning my own tail feathers?\nJesus has no room for pecking orders. Love “does not boast, it is not proud” (1 Cor. 13:4 NIV).\nHis solution to man-made caste systems? A change of direction. In a world of upward mobility, choose downward servility. Go down, not up.\n“Regard one another as more important than yourselves” (Phil. 2:3 NASB).\nThat’s what Jesus did.\nHe flip-flopped the pecking order. While others were going up, he was going down. “He humbled himself and became obedient to death— even death on a cross!” ',
