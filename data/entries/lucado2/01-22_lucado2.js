He’d die for your sin before he’d let you die in your sin, so he did.\nWhat do you do with such a Savior? Don’t you sing to him? Don’t you declare, confess, and proclaim his name? Don’t you bow a knee, lower a head, hammer a nail, feed the poor, and lift up your gift in worship? Of course you do.\nWorship God. Applaud him loud and often. For your sake, you need it.\nAnd for heaven’s sake, he deserves it. ',
