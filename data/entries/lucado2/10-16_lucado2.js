And now all is quiet. The mocking has ceased. There is no one to mock.\nThe soldiers are busy with the business of cleaning up the dead. Two men have come. Dressed well and meaning well, they are given the body of Jesus.\nAnd we are left with the relics of his death.\nThree nails in a bin.\nThree cross-shaped shadows.\nA braided crown with scarlet tips.\nBizarre, isn’t it? The thought that this blood is not man’s blood but God’s?\nCrazy, isn’t it? To think that these nails held your sins to a cross? …\nAbsurdities and ironies. The hill of Calvary is nothing if not both. ',
