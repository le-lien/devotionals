Mine like a gold digger the unique-to-you nuggets from your life… .\nWhen God gives an assignment, he also gives the skill. Study your skills, then, to reveal your assignment.\nLook at you. Your uncanny ease with numbers. Your quenchless curiosity about chemistry. Others stare at blueprints and yawn; you read them and drool. “I was made to do this,” you say.\nOur Maker gives assignments to people, “to each according to each one’s unique ability.” As he calls, he equips. Look back over your life. What have you consistently done well? What have you loved to do? Stand at the intersection of your affections and successes and find your uniqueness.\nCure for the Common Life\nOctober\nWe can come before God’s throne\nwhere there is grace. ',
