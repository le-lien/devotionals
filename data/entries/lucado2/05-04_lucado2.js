I’m not referring to an idiom or dialect but to the day-today drama of your life… .\nThere are times he speaks the “language of abundance.” Is your tummy full? Are your bills paid? Got a little jingle in your pocket? Don’t be so proud of what you have that you miss what you need to hear. Could it be you have much so you can give much?\nOr how about the “language of affliction”? Talk about an idiom we avoid. But you and I both know how clearly God speaks in hospital hallways and sickbeds.\nGod speaks all languages—including yours… . What language is God speaking to you? ',
