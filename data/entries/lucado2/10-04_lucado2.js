    "body": 'You have one. A divine spark. An uncommon call to an uncommon life.\n“The Spirit has given each of us a special way of serving others.” So much for the excuse “I don’t have anything to offer.” Did the apostle Paul say,\n“The Spirit has given some of us …”? Or, “The Spirit has given a few of us\n… ”? No. “The Spirit has given each of us a special way of serving others.”\nEnough of this self-deprecating “I can’t do anything.”\nAnd enough of its arrogant opposite: “I have to do everything.” No, you don’t! You’re not God’s solution to society, but a solution in society. Imitate Paul, who said, “Our goal is to stay within the boundaries of God’s plan for us” (2 Cor. 10:13 NLT). Clarify your contribution.\nDon’t worry about skills you don’t have. Don’t covet strengths others do have. Just extract your uniqueness. ',
