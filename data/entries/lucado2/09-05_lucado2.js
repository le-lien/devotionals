He sits between Mary and Martha, puts an arm around each, and sobs… .\nHe weeps with them.\nHe weeps for them.\nHe weeps with you.\nHe weeps for you.\nHe weeps so we will know: Mourning is not disbelieving. Flooded eyes don’t represent a faithless heart. A person can enter a cemetery Jesus-certain of life after death and still have a Twin Tower crater in the heart.\nChrist did. He wept, and he knew he was ten minutes from seeing a living Lazarus!\nAnd his tears give you permission to shed your own. Grief does not mean you don’t trust; it simply means you can’t stand the thought of another day without the Lazarus of your life. If Jesus gave the love, he understands the tears. So grieve, but don’t grieve like those who don’t know the rest of this story. ',
