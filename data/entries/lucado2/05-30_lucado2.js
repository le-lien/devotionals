Don’t see yourself as a product of your parents’ DNA, but rather as a brand-new idea from heaven.\nMake a big deal out of God. Become who you are for him! Has he not transferred you from a dull, death-destined life to a rich, heaven-bound adventure? Remember, “You were chosen to tell about the excellent qualities of God.” And do so every day of your life.\nWith God, every day matters, every person counts.\nAnd that includes you. ',
