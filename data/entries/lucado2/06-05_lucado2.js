    "body": '“I am with you always” are the words of a God who in one instant did the impossible to make it all possible for you and me.(Matt. 28:20) It all happened in a moment. In one moment . . . a most remarkable moment. The Word became flesh.\nThere will be another. The world will see another instantaneous transformation. You see, in becoming man, God made it possible for man to see God. When Jesus went home he left the back door open. As a result,\n“we shall all be changed— in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.”\nThe first moment of transformation went unnoticed by the world. But you can bet your sweet September that the second one won’t. ',
