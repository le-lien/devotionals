As Christ dominates your thoughts, he changes you from one degree of glory to another until— hang on!—you are ready to live with him.\nHeaven is the land of sinless minds… . Absolute trust. No fear or anger.\nShame and second-guessing are practices of a prior life. Heaven will be wonderful, not because the streets are gold, but because our thoughts will be pure.\nSo what are you waiting on? … Give him your best thoughts, and see if he doesn’t change your mind.
