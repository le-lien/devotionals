    "body": 'Only one sight enthralls angels—God’s face. They know that he is Lord of all.\nAnd as a result, they worship him. Whether in the temple with Isaiah or the pasture with the Bethlehem shepherds, angels worship… .\n“All the angels stood around the throne … saying: ‘Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom, thanksgiving and honor and power and might, be to our God forever and ever. Amen.’”\nDoesn’t their worship proclaim volumes about God’s beauty? Angels could gaze at the Grand Tetons and Grand Canyon, Picasso paintings and the Sistine Chapel, but they choose, instead, to fix their eyes on the glory of God. They can’t see enough of him, and they can’t be silent about what they see. ',
