And that something is described by the writer of Hebrews.\n“So, brothers and sisters, we are completely free to enter the Most Holy Place without fear because of the blood of Jesus’ death. We can enter through a new and living way that Jesus opened for us. It leads through the curtain—Christ’s body” (Heb. 10:19–20).\nTo the original readers, those last four words were explosive: “the curtain\n—Christ’s body.” According to the writer, the curtain equals Jesus. Hence, whatever happened to the flesh of Jesus happened to the curtain. What happened to his flesh? It was torn. Torn by the whips, torn by the thorns.\nTorn by the weight of the cross and the point of the nails. But in the horror of his torn flesh, we find the splendor of the open door. ',
