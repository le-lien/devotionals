    "body": 'Common belief identifies members of God’s family. And common affection unites them. Paul gives this relationship rule for the church: “Be devoted to one another in brotherly love.” The apostle plays the wordsmith here, bookending the verse with fraternal-twin terms. He begins with philostorgos ( philos means friendly; storgos means family love) and concludes with philadelphia ( phileo means tender affection; adelphia means brethren). An awkward but accurate translation of the verse might be\n“Have a friend/family devotion to each other in a friend/family sort of way.” If Paul doesn’t get us with the first adjective, he catches us with the second. In both he reminds us: the church is God’s family.\nYou didn’t pick me. I didn’t pick you. You may not like me. I may not like you. But since God picked and likes us both, we are family. ',
