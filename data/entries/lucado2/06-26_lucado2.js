    "body": 'Remember [Christ’s] followers’ fear at the crucifixion? They ran. Scared as cats in a dog pound… .\nBut fast-forward forty days. Bankrupt traitors have become a force of life-changing fury. Peter is preaching in the very precinct where Christ was arrested. Followers of Christ defy the enemies of Christ. Whip them and they’ll worship. Lock them up and they’ll launch a jailhouse ministry. As bold after the Resurrection as they were cowardly before it.\nExplanation:\nGreed? They made no money.\nPower? They gave all the credit to Christ.\nPopularity? Most were killed for their beliefs.\nOnly one explanation remains—a resurrected Christ and his Holy Spirit.\nThe courage of these men and women was forged in the fire of the empty tomb. ',
