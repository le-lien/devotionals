Would’ve been nice. But it didn’t happen. When it came to your life on earth, you weren’t given a voice or a vote.\nBut when it comes to life after death, you were. In my book that seems like a good deal. Wouldn’t you agree? …\nHave we been given any greater privilege than that of choice? Not only does this privilege offset any injustice, the gift of free will can offset any mistakes.\nYou’ve made some bad choices in life, haven’t you? You’ve chosen the wrong friends, maybe the wrong career, even the wrong spouse. You look back over your life and say, “If only … if only I could make up for those bad choices.” You can. One good choice for eternity offsets a thousand bad ones on earth.\nThe choice is yours. ',
