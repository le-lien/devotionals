    "body": 'Don’t we love the word “with”? “Will you go with me?” we ask. “To the store, to the hospital, through my life?” God says he will. “I am with you always,” Jesus said before he ascended to heaven, “to the very end of the age” (Matt. 28:20 NIV). Search for restrictions on the promise; you’ll find none. You won’t find “I’ll be with you if you behave … when you believe.\nI’ll be with you on Sundays in worship . . . at mass.” No, none of that.\nThere’s no withholding tax on God’s “with” promise. He is with us.\nGod is with us.\nProphets weren’t enough. Apostles wouldn’t do. Angels won’t suffice.\nGod sent more than miracles and messages. He sent himself; he sent his Son. “The Word became flesh and dwelt among us.” ',
