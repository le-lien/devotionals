All welcome. You don’t have to be rich to drink, religious to drink, successful to drink; you simply need to follow the instructions on what—or better, who—to drink. Him. In order for Jesus to do what water does, you must let him penetrate your heart. Deep, deep inside.\nInternalize him. Ingest him. Welcome him into the inner workings of your life. Let Christ be the water of your soul. ',
