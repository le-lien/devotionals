    "body": 'When Jesus says, “Come to me,” he doesn’t say come to religion, come to a system, or come to a certain doctrine. This is a very personal invitation to a God, an invitation to a Savior.\nOur God is not aloof—he’s not so far above us that he can’t see and understand our problems. Jesus isn’t a God who stayed on the mountaintop\n— he’s a Savior who came down and lived and worked with the people.\nEverywhere he went, the crowds followed, drawn together by the magnet that was— and is—the Savior.\nThe life of Jesus Christ is a message of hope, a message of mercy, a message of life in a dark world.
