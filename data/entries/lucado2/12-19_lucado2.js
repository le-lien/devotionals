    "body": 'That last phrase is worthy of your highlighter: “when the time comes.”\n“I don’t know what I’ll do if my husband dies.” You will, when the time comes.\n“When my children leave the house, I don’t think I can take it.” It won’t be easy, but strength will arrive when the time comes.\n“I could never lead a church. There is too much I don’t know.” You may be right. Or you may be wanting to know everything too soon. Could it be that God will reveal answers to you when the time comes?\nThe key is this: Meet today’s problems with today’s strength. Don’t start tackling tomorrow’s problems until tomorrow. You do not have tomorrow’s strength yet. You simply have enough for today. ',
