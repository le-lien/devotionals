    "body": 'Chiffon wings and meringue sweetness? Perhaps for angels in the gift books and specialty shops, but God’s angels are marked by indescribable strength. Paul says Christ “will come with his mighty angels” (2 Thess. 1:7\nNLT). From the word translated mighty, we have the English word dynamic.\nAngels pack dynamic force. It took only one angel to slay the firstborn of Egypt and only one angel to close the mouths of the lions to protect Daniel.\nDavid called angels “mighty creatures who carry out his plans, listening for each of his commands” (Ps. 103:20 NLT).\nNo need for you to talk to angels; they won’t listen. Their ears incline only to God’s voice. They are “spirits who serve God,” responding to his command and following only his directions. Jesus said they “always see the face of my Father in heaven” (Matt. 18:10 NIV). Only one sound matters to angels—God’s voice. ',
