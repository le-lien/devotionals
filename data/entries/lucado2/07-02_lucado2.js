    "body": 'The cross … rests on the time line of history like a compelling diamond.\nIts tragedy summons all sufferers. Its absurdity attracts all cynics. Its hope lures all searchers… .\nHistory has idolized it and despised it, gold-plated it and burned it, worn and trashed it. History has done everything to it but ignore it.\nThat’s the one option that the cross does not offer.\nNo one can ignore it! You can’t ignore a piece of lumber that suspends the greatest claim in history. A crucified carpenter claiming that he is God on earth? Divine? Eternal? The death-slayer? …\nTo accept or reject Christ without a careful examination of Calvary is like deciding on a car without looking at the engine. Being religious without knowing the cross is like owning a Mercedes with no motor. Pretty package, but where is your power? ',
