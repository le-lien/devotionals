Love all and are loved by all. Is that you?\nYou have no fears.  Call you the Teflon toughie. Wall Street plummets—\nno problem. Heart condition discovered—yawn. Does this describe you?\nYou need no forgiveness.  Never made a mistake. As square as a game of checkers. As clean as grandma’s kitchen. Is that you? No?\nLet’s evaluate this. A few of your relationships are shaky. You have fears and faults. Hmmm. Do you really want to hang on to your chest of self-reliance? Sounds to me as if you could use a shepherd. ',
