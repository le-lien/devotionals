Just as it’s against your nature to eat trees and against mine to grow wings, it’s against God’s nature to remember forgiven sins.\nYou see, God is either the God of perfect grace . . . or he is not God.\nGrace forgets. Period. He who is perfect love cannot hold grudges. If he does, then he isn’t perfect love. And if he isn’t perfect love, you might as well put this book down and go fishing, because both of us are chasing fairy tales.\nBut I believe in his loving forgetfulness. And I believe he has a graciously terrible memory. ',
