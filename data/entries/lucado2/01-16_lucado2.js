    "body": 'Remember the words of Jesus to the Samaritan woman? “The water I give will become a spring of water gushing up inside that person, giving eternal life.” Jesus offers, not a singular drink of water, but a perpetual artesian well! And the well isn’t a hole in your backyard but the Holy Spirit of God in your heart.\n“If anyone believes in me, rivers of living water will flow out from that person’s heart, as the Scripture says.” Jesus was talking about the Holy Spirit. The Spirit had not yet been given, because Jesus had not yet been raised to glory. But later, those who believed in Jesus would receive the Spirit (John 7:38–39).\nWater, in this verse, is a picture of the Spirit of Jesus working in us. He’s not working to save us, mind you; that work is done. He’s working to change us. ',
