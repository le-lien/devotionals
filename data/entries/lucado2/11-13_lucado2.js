As the song says, “Dressed in his righteousness alone, faultless to stand before the throne.”\nPresumptuous, you say? Sacrilegious? It would be if it were my idea. But it isn’t; it’s his. We are presumptuous not when we marvel at his grace, but when we reject it. And we’re sacrilegious not when we claim his forgiveness, but when we allow the haunting sins of yesterday to convince us that God forgives but he doesn’t forget.\nDo yourself a favor. Remember … he forgot. ',
