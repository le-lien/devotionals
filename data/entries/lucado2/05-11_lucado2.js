    "body": 'It must have been Jesus’ finest possession.\nJewish tradition called for a mother to make such a robe and present it to her son as a departure gift when he left home. Had Mary done this for Jesus? We don’t know. But we do know the tunic was without seam, woven from top to bottom. Why is this significant?\nScripture often describes our behavior as the clothes we wear. Peter urges us to be “clothed with humility” (1 Pet. 5:5 NKJV). David speaks of evil people who clothe themselves “with cursing” (Ps. 109:18 NKJV). Garments can symbolize character, and like his garment, Jesus’ character was seamless. Coordinated. Unified. He was like his robe: uninterrupted perfection. ',
