Just ask the kid who didn’t make the little league team or the fellow who got the pink slip or the mother of three who got dumped for a “pretty little thing.”\nNot many second chances. Nowadays it’s more like, “It’s now or never.”\n“Around here we don’t tolerate incompetence.” “Gotta get tough to get along.” “Not much room at the top.” “Three strikes and you’re out.” “It’s a dog-eat-dog world!”\nJesus … would say. “Then don’t live with the dogs.” That makes sense doesn’t it? Why let a bunch of other failures tell you how much of a failure you are? …\nIt’s not every day that you find someone who will give you a second chance—much less someone who will give you a second chance every day.\nBut in Jesus, you find both.
