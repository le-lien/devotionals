    "body": 'Of course the sky is dark; people are killing the Light of the World.\nThe universe grieves. God said it would. “On that day … I will make the sun go down at noon, and darken the earth in broad daylight. . . . I will make it like the mourning for an only son, and the end of it like a bitter day” (Amos 8:9–10 RSV).\nThe sky weeps. And a lamb bleats. Remember the time of the scream?\n“At about three o’clock Jesus cried out.” Three o’clock in the afternoon, the hour of the temple sacrifice. Less than a mile to the east, a finely clothed priest leads a lamb to the slaughter, unaware that his work is futile. Heaven is not looking at the lamb of man but at “the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world” (John 1:29 RSV). ',
