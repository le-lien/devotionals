We usually knew that trouble was just around the bend.\nChristians who have fallen away felt the fire waning long before it went out. Unwanted pregnancies or explosions of anger may appear to be the fruit of a moment’s waywardness, but in reality, they’re usually the result of a history of ignoring warnings about an impending fire.\nAre you close to the falls? Are your senses numb? Are your eyes trained to turn and roll when they should pause and observe?\nThen maybe you need to repair your warning detector. ',
