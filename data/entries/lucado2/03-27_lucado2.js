    "body": 'There is a common denominator in any form of greatness—reliability.\nIt’s the bread and butter characteristic of achievement. It’s the shared ingredient behind retirement pens, Hall of Fame awards, and golden anniversaries. It is the quality that produces not momentary heroics but monumental lives.\nThe Bible has its share… . Consistent and predictable, these saints were spurred by a gut-level conviction that they had been called by no one less than God himself. As a result, their work wasn’t affected by moods, cloudy days, or rocky trails. Their performance graph didn’t rise and fall with roller-coaster irregularity. They weren’t addicted to accolades or applause nor deterred by grumpy bosses or empty wallets… . And since their loyalty was not determined by their comfort, they were just as faithful in dark prisons as they were in spotlighted pulpits. ',
