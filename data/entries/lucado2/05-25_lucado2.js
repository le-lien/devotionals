    "body": 'Pilate is correct in his question. “What should I do with Jesus, the one called the Christ?”\nPerhaps you, like Pilate, are curious about this one called Jesus.\nWhat do you do with a man who claims to be God, yet hates religion?\nWhat do you do with a man who calls himself the Savior, yet condemns systems? What do you do with a man who knows the place and time of his death, yet goes there anyway? …\nYou have two choices.\nYou can reject him. That is an option. You can, as have many, decide that the idea of God’s becoming a carpenter is too bizarre— and walk away.\nOr you can accept him. You can journey with him. You can listen for his voice amid the hundreds of voices and follow him. ',
