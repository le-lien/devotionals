The graveclothes were still rolled and folded.\nHow could this be? …\nIf for some reason friends or foes had unwrapped the body, would they have been so careful as to dispose of the clothing in such an orderly fashion? Of course not! But if neither friend nor foe took the body, who did? …\nThrough the rags of death, John saw the power of life. Odd, don’t you think, that God would use something as sad as a burial wrap to change a life?\nBut God is given to such practices:\nIn his hand empty wine jugs at a wedding become a symbol of power.\nThe coin of a widow becomes a symbol of generosity.\nAnd a tool of death is a symbol of his love.
