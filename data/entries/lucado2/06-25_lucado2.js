He doesn’t communicate by stacking stars in the heavens or reincarnating grandparents from the grave… .\nHe’s not a magician or a good-luck charm or the man upstairs. He is, instead, the Creator of the universe who is right here in the thick of our day-to-day world who speaks to you more through cooing babies and hungry bellies than he ever will through horoscopes, zodiac papers, or weeping Madonnas.\nIf you get some supernatural vision or hear some strange voice in the night, don’t get too carried away. It could be God or it could be indigestion, and you don’t want to misinterpret one for the other.\nGod speaks in our world. We just have to learn to hear him … amidst the ordinary. ',
