To put a lock and key on your emotions is to bury part of your Christlikeness!\nEspecially when you come to Calvary.\nYou can’t go to the cross with just your head and not your heart. It doesn’t work that way. Calvary is not a mental trip. It’s not an intellectual exercise. It’s not a divine calculation or a cold theological principle.\nIt’s a heart-splitting hour of emotion.\nDon’t walk away from it dry-eyed and unstirred. Don’t just straighten your tie and clear your throat. Don’t allow yourself to descend Calvary cool and collected.\nPlease … pause. Look again.\nThose are nails in those hands. That’s God on that cross. It’s us who put him there. ',
