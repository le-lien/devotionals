If such is the case I can’t resist the chance to say one thing.\nThank you.\nThank you, senior saints, for a generation of prayer and forest clearing.\nThank you, teachers, for the countless Sunday school lessons, prepared and delivered with tenderness.\nThank you, missionaries, for your bravery in sharing the timeless truth in a foreign tongue.\nThank you, preachers. You thought we weren’t listening, but we were.\nAnd your stubborn sowing of God’s seed is bearing fruit you may never see this side of the great harvest. ',
