So many changes within. So many alterations without. And, somewhere, back there, we leave him. We don’t turn away from him … we just don’t take him with us. Assignments come. Promotions come. Budgets are made. Kids are born, and the Christ … the Christ is forgotten.\nHas it been a while since you stared at the heavens in speechless amazement? Has it been a while since you realized God’s divinity and your carnality?\nIf it has, then you need to know something. He is still there. He hasn’t left. ',
