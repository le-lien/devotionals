And, oh, how wide his love reaches.\nAren’t you glad the verse does not read:\n“For God so loved the rich … ”?\nOr, “For God so loved the famous … ”?\nOr, “For God so loved the thin … ”?\nIt doesn’t. Nor does it state, “For God so loved the Europeans or Africans\n… ” “the sober or successful … ” “the young or the old … ”\nNo, when we read John 3:16, we simply (and happily) read, “For God so loved the world.”\nHow wide is God’s love? Wide enough for the whole world. ',
