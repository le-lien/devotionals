    "body": 'In God’s book man is heading somewhere. He has an amazing destiny.\nWe are being prepared to walk down the church aisle and become the bride of Jesus. We are going to live with him. Share the throne with him. Reign with him. We count. We are valuable. And what’s more, our worth is built in! Our value is inborn.\nYou see, if there was anything that Jesus wanted everyone to understand it was this: A person is worth something simply because he is a person.\nThat is why he treated people like he did. Think about it. The girl caught making undercover thunder with someone she shouldn’t—he forgave her.\nThe untouchable leper who asked for cleansing—he touched him. And the blind welfare case that cluttered the roadside—he honored him. And the worn-out old windbag addicted to self-pity near the pool of Siloam—he healed him! ',
