My motives were pure and my heart was thankful, but my understanding of God was wrong. It was when I used the word remember that it hit me.\n“Remember the time I …” I was about to thank God for another act of mercy. But I stopped. Something was wrong. The word remember seemed displaced… . “Does he remember?”\nThen I remembered. I remembered his words. “And I will remember their sins no more.”\nWow! Now, that is a remarkable promise.\nGod doesn’t just forgive, he forgets… . For all the things he does do, this is one thing he refuses to do. He refuses to keep a list of my wrongs. ',
