    "body": 'Scripture calls the church a poem. “We are His workmanship” (Eph.\n2:10). Workmanship descends from the Greek word poeo or poetry. We are God’s poetry! What Longfellow did with pen and paper, our Maker does with us. We express his creative best.\nYou aren’t God’s poetry. I’m not God’s poetry. We are God’s poetry.\nPoetry demands variety. “God works through different men in different ways, but it is the same God who achieves his purposes through them all”\n(1 Cor. 12:6 PHILLIPS). God uses all types to type his message. Logical thinkers. Emotional worshipers. Dynamic leaders. Docile followers. The visionaries who lead, the studious who ponder, the generous who pay the bills… . Alone, we are meaningless symbols on a page. But collectively, we inspire. ',
