With the exception of you trivia hounds, none of us remember the headliners of yesterday too well.\nSurprising how quickly we forget, isn’t it? And what I’ve mentioned above are no second-rate achievements. These are the best in their fields. But the applause dies. Awards tarnish. Achievements are forgotten.\nHere’s another quiz. See how you do on this one.\nName ten people who have taught you something worthwhile.\nName five friends who have helped you in a difficult time.\nEasier? It was for me, too. The lesson? The people who make a difference are not the ones with the credentials, but the ones with the concern. ',
