    "body": 'Even a casual student of Scripture notes the connection between blood and mercy. As far back as the son of Adam, worshipers knew “without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness” (Heb. 9:22 NIV).\nWith a field as his temple and the ground as his altar, Abel became the first to do what millions would imitate. He offered a blood sacrifice for sins.\nThose who followed suit form a long line: Abraham, Moses, Gideon, Samson, Saul, David… . They knew the shedding of blood was necessary for the forgiveness of sins. Jacob knew it too; hence, the stones were stacked for the altar… .\nBut the line ended at the cross. What Abel sought to accomplish in the field, God achieved with his Son. What Abel began, Christ completed.\nAfter Christ’s sacrifice there would be no more need to shed blood. ',
