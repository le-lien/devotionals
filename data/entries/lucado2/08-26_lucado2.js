James says, “Anyone who is having troubles should pray” (James 5:13).\nBefore you go anywhere else with your disappointments, go to God.\nMaybe you don’t want to trouble God with your hurts. After all, he’s got famines and pestilence and wars; he won’t care about my little struggles, you think. Why don’t you let him decide that? He cared enough about a wedding to provide the wine. He cared enough about Peter’s tax payment to give him a coin. He cared enough about the woman at the well to give her answers. “He cares about you” (1 Pet. 5:7). ',
