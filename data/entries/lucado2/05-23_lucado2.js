    "body": 'We eat our share of forbidden fruit. We say what we shouldn’t say. Go where we shouldn’t go. Pluck fruit from trees we shouldn’t touch.\nAnd when we do, the door opens, and the shame tumbles in. And we hide. We sew fig leaves… . We cover ourselves in good works and good deeds, but one gust of the wind of truth, and we are naked again—stark naked in our own failure.\nSo what does God do? Exactly what he did for our parents in the garden.\nHe sheds innocent blood. He offers the life of his Son. And from the scene of the sacrifice the Father takes a robe— the robe of righteousness. And does he throw it in our direction and tell us to shape up? No, he dresses us himself. He dresses us with himself. “You were all baptized into Christ, and so you were all clothed with Christ” (Gal. 3:26–27).\nWe hide. He seeks. We bring sin. He brings a sacrifice. We try fig leaves.\nHe brings the robe of righteousness. ',
