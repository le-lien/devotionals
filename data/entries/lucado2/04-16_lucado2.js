We all have.\nSharing a porch swing on a summer evening with your grandchild.\nSeeing her face in the glow of a candle.\nPutting your arm into your husband’s as you stroll through the golden leaves and breathe the brisk autumn air.\nListening to your six-year-old thank God for everything from goldfish to Grandma.\nSuch moments are necessary because they remind us that everything is okay. The King is still on the throne and life is still worth living. Eternal instants remind us that love is still the greatest possession and the future is nothing to fear.\nThe next time an instant in your life begins to be eternal, let it. ',
