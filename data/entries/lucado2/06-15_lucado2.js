    "body": 'When David volunteered to go mano a mano with Goliath, King Saul tried to clothe the shepherd boy with soldier’s armor. After all, Goliath stood over nine feet tall. He wore a bronze helmet and a 125-pound coat of mail. He bore bronze leggings and carried a javelin and a spear with a 15-pound head (1 Sam. 17:4–7 NLT). And David? David had a slingshot. This is a VW Bug playing blink with an eighteen-wheeler… . When Saul saw David, pimpled, and Goliath, rippled, he did what any Iron Age king would do. “Saul gave David his own armor—a bronze helmet and a coat of mail”\n(1 Sam. 17:38 NLT)… .\nBut David rejected the armor, selected the stones, lobotomized the giant, and taught us a powerful lesson: what fits others might not fit you. Indeed what fits the king might not fit you. Just because someone gives you advice, a job, or a promotion, you don’t have to accept it. Let your uniqueness define your path of life. ',
