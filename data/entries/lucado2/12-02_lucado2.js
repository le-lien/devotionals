    "body": 'Suppose you dwell in a high-rise apartment. On the window sill of your room is a solitary daisy. This morning you picked the daisy and pinned it on your lapel.\nBut as soon as you’re out the door, people start picking petals off your daisy. Someone snags your subway seat. Petal picked. You’re blamed for the bad report of a coworker… . More petals. By the end of the day, you’re down to one… . You’re only one petal-snatching away from a blowup.\nWhat if the scenario was altered slightly? Let’s add one character. The kind man in the apartment next door runs a flower shop. Every night on the way home he stops at your place with a fresh bouquet. Because of him, your apartment has a sweet fragrance, and your step has a happy bounce.\nLet someone mess with your flower, and you’ve got a basketful to replace it!\nGod hand-delivers a bouquet to your door every day. Open it! Take them!\nThen, when rejections come, you won’t be left short-petaled. ',
