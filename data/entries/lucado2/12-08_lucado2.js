If I can’t, my son will.” So God says, Nor your son.  “Then my daughter will.” Nor your daughter… .\n“I guess I’ll have to send my cow to run the store, or maybe I’ll find some stranger to help me.” No,  God says. One day of the week you will say no to work and yes to worship. You will slow and sit down and lie down and rest.\nStill we object… . “What about my grades?” “I’ve got my sales quota.”\nWe offer up one reason after another, but God silences them all with a poignant reminder: “In six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day.” God’s message is plain: “If creation didn’t crash when I rested, it won’t crash when you do.”\nRepeat these words after me: It is not my job to run the world.
