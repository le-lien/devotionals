Before agreeing to publish it, they read it—every single word. Multiple sets of editorial eyes scoured the manuscript, moaning at my bad jokes, grading my word crafting, suggesting a tune-up here and a tone-down there. We volleyed pages back and forth, writer to editor to writer, until finally we all agreed—\nthis is it. It’s time to publish or pass. The publisher could pass, mind you.\nSometimes they do. But in this case, obviously they didn’t. With perfect knowledge of this imperfect product, they signed on. What you read may surprise you, but not them.\nWhat you do may stun you, but not God. With perfect knowledge of your imperfect life, God signed on. ',
