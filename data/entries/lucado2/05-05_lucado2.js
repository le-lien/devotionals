    "body": 'Our faith is not in religion; our faith is in God. A hardy, daring faith that believes God will do what is right, every time. And that God will do what it takes—whatever it takes—to bring his children home.\nHe is the shepherd in search of his lamb. His legs are scratched, his feet are sore and his eyes are burning. He scales the cliffs and traverses the fields. He explores the caves. He cups his hands to his mouth and calls into the canyon.\nAnd the name he calls is yours.\nHe is the housewife in search of the lost coin. No matter that he has nine others, he won’t rest until he has found the tenth. He searches the house. He moves furniture… . All other tasks can wait. Only one matters. The coin is of great value to him. He owns it. He will not stop until he finds it.\nThe coin he seeks is you. ',
