    "body": 'The Israelites considered the name Yahweh too holy to be spoken by human lips. Whenever they needed to say Yahweh, they substituted the word Adonai, which means “Lord.” If the name needed to be written, the scribes would take a bath before they wrote it and destroy the pen afterward.\nThe name I AM sounds strikingly close to the Hebrew verb to be—\nhavah. It’s quite possibly a combination of the present tense form (I am) and the causative tense (I cause to be). Yahweh, then, seems to mean “I AM” and “I cause.” God is the “One who is” and the “One who causes.”\nWhy is that important? Because we need a big God. And if God is the\n“One who is,” then he is an unchanging God. ',
