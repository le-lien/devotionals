For fear of standing out, we wear what everyone else wears.\nFor fear of blending in, we wear what no one else wears. For fear of sleeping alone, we sleep with anyone. For fear of not being loved, we search for love in all the wrong places.\nBut God flushes those fears. Those saturated in God’s love don’t sell out to win the love of others. They don’t even sell out to win the love of God.\nDo you think you need to? Do you think, If I cuss less, pray more, drink less, study more … if I try harder, God will love me more?  Sniff and smell Satan’s stench behind those words. We all need improvement, but we don’t need to woo God’s love. We change because we already have God’s love.\nGod’s perfect love. ',
