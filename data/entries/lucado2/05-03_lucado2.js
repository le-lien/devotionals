    "body": 'Adam and Eve turned their heads toward the hiss of the snake and for the first time ignored God. Eve did not ask, “God, what do you want?” Adam didn’t suggest, “Let’s consult the Creator.” They acted as if they had no heavenly Father. His will was ignored, and sin, with death on its coattails, entered the world.\nSin sees the world with no God in it.\nWhere we might think of sin as slip-ups or missteps, God views sin as a godless attitude that leads to godless actions. “All of us have strayed away like sheep. We have left God’s paths to follow our own.” The sinful mind dismisses God. His counsel goes unconsulted. His opinion, unsolicited… .\nThe lack of God-centeredness leads to self-centeredness. Sin celebrates its middle letter—sIn. ',
