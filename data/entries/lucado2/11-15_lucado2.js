God on his throne.\nBut God on a cross?\nA split-lipped, puffy-eyed, blood-masked God on a cross?\nSponge thrust in his face?\nSpear plunged in his side?\nDice tossed at his feet?\nNo, we wouldn’t have written the drama of redemption this way. But, then again, we weren’t asked to. These players and props were heaven picked and God ordained. We were not asked to design the hour.\nBut we have been asked to respond to it. ',
