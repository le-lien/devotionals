The word weakness can refer to physical infirmities, as with the invalid who had been unable to walk for thirty-eight years (John 5:5), or spiritual impotence, as with the spiritually\n“helpless” of Romans 5:6.\nWhether we are feeble of soul or body or both, how good to know it’s not up to us. The Spirit himself is pleading for us. ',
