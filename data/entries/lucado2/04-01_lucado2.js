    "body": '“You want to know who God really is?”\nDavid asks. “Then read this.” And he writes the name Yahweh. “Yahweh is my shepherd.”\nThough foreign to us, the name was rich to David. So rich, in fact, that David chose Yahweh over El Shaddai (God Almighty), El Elyon (God Most High), and El Olam (God the Everlasting). These and many other titles for God were at David’s disposal. But when he considered all the options, David chose Yahweh.\nWhy Yahweh?  Because Yahweh is God’s name. You can call me preacher or writer or half-baked golfer—these are accurate descriptions, but these aren’t my names. I might call you dad, mom, doctor, or student, and those terms may describe you, but they aren’t your name. If you want to call me by my name, say Max.  If I call you by your name, I say it. And if you want to call God by his name, say Yahweh. ',
