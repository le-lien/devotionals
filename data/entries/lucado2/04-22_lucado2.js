    "body": 'The church of Jesus Christ began with a group of frightened men in a second-floor room in Jerusalem.\nThough they’d marched with Jesus for three years, they now sat . . .\nafraid. They were timid soldiers, reluctant warriors, speechless messengers.\nDaring to dream that the master had left them some word, some plan, some direction, they came back.\nBut little did they know their wildest dream wasn’t wild enough. Just as someone mumbles, “It’s no use,” they hear a noise. They hear a voice:\n“Peace be with you.”\nThe one betrayed sought his betrayers. What did he say to them? Not\n“What a bunch of flops!” Not “I told you so.” No “Where-were-you-when-I-needed-you?” speeches. But simply one phrase, “Peace be with you.” The very thing they didn’t have was the very thing he offered: peace. ',
