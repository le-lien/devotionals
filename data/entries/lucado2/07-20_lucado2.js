    "body": 'With the same intensity that he hates arrogance, God loves humility. The Jesus who said, “I am gentle and humble in heart” (Matt. 11:29 NASB) loves those who are gentle and humble in heart. “Though the LORD is supreme, he takes care of those who are humble” (Ps. 138:6). God says, “I live with people who are … humble” (Isa. 57:15). He also says, “To this one I will look, to him who is humble and contrite” (Isa. 66:2 NASB). And to the humble, God gives great treasures:\nHe gives honor: “Humility goes before honor” (Prov. 15:33 NRSV).\nHe gives wisdom: “With the humble is wisdom” (Prov. 11:2 NASB).\nHe gives direction: “He teaches the humble His way” (Ps. 25:9 NASB).\nAnd most significantly, he gives grace: “God . . . gives grace to the humble” (1 Pet. 5:5).
