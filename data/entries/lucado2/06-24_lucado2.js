Listen to God’s surprises.\nHear the rocks meant for the body of the adulterous woman drop to the ground.\nListen as the Messiah whispers to the Samaritan woman, “I who speak to you am he.”\nListen to the widow from Nain eating dinner with her son who is supposed to be dead… .\nGod appearing at the strangest of places. Doing the strangest of things.\nStretching smiles where there had hung only frowns. Placing twinkles where there were only tears. ',
