Through torn skin he promised acceptance. He took the path to take us home. He wore our garment to give us his own. We have seen the gifts he brought.\nNow we ask, what will we bring? …\nWhy don’t you start with your bad moments?\nThose bad habits? Leave them at the cross. Your selfish moods and white lies? Give them to God. Your binges and bigotries? God wants them all.\nEvery flop, every failure. He wants every single one. Why? Because he knows we can’t live with them. ',
