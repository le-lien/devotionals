    "body": 'For many people, life is—well, life is a jungle. Not a jungle of trees and beasts. . . . Our jungles are comprised of the thicker thickets of failing health, broken hearts, and empty wallets… . We don’t hear the screeching of birds or the roaring of lions, but we do hear the complaints of neighbors and the demands of bosses… .\nWhether you are a lamb lost on a craggy ledge or a city slicker alone in a deep jungle, everything changes when your rescuer appears.\nYour loneliness diminishes, because you have fellowship. Your despair decreases, because you have vision. Your confusion begins to lift, because you have direction.\nYou haven’t left the jungle. The trees still eclipse the sky, and the thorns still cut the skin. . . . It hasn’t changed, but you have. You have changed because you have hope. And you have hope because you have met someone who can lead you out. ',
