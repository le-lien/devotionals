    "body": 'Are you convinced that you have never lived a loveless day? Not one.\nNever unloved. Those times you deserted Christ? He loved you. You hid from him; he came looking for you.\nAnd those occasions you denied Christ? Though you belonged to him, you hung with them, and when his name surfaced, you cursed like a drunken sailor. God let you hear the crowing of conscience and feel the heat of tears. But he never let you go. Your denials cannot diminish his love.\nNor can your doubts. You’ve had them. You may have them even now.\nWhile there is much we cannot know, may never know, can’t we be sure of this? Doubts don’t separate doubters from God’s love. ',
