The word may be different, but the message is the same: These bodies are weak. They began decaying the minute we began breathing.\nAnd, according to God, that’s a part of the plan. Every wrinkle and every needle take us one step closer to the last step when Jesus will change our simple bodies into forever bodies. No pain. No depression. No sickness. No end.\nThis is not our forever house. It will serve for the time being. But there is nothing like the moment we enter his door.\nTraveling Light\nFebruary\nI will extol You, O LORD , for You have lifted me up. ',
