    "body": 'To the casual observer the six hours are mundane… .\nGod is on a cross. The creator of the universe is being executed.\nSpit and blood are caked to his cheeks, and his lips are cracked and swollen. Thorns rip his scalp. His lungs scream with pain. His legs knot with cramps. Taut nerves threaten to snap as pain twangs her morbid melody. Yet, death is not ready. And there is no one to save him, for he is sacrificing himself.\nIt is no normal six hours … it is no normal Friday.\nLet me ask you a question: What do you do with that day in history?\nWhat do you do with its claims?\nIf it really happened … if God did commandeer his own crucifixion …\nif he did turn his back on his own son … those six hours were no normal six hours. They were the most critical hours in history. ',
