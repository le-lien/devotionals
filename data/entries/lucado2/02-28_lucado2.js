    "body": 'Our love depends on the receiver of the love. Let a thousand people pass before us, and we will not feel the same about each. Our love will be regulated by their appearance, by their personalities. Even when we find a few people we like, our feelings will fluctuate. How they treat us will affect how we love them. The receiver regulates our love.\nNot so with the love of God. We have no thermostatic impact on his love for us. The love of God is born from within him, not from what he finds in us. His love is uncaused and spontaneous… .\nDoes he love us because of our goodness? Because of our kindness?\nBecause of our great faith? No, he loves us because of his goodness, kindness, and great faith.\nA Love Worth Giving\nMarch\n“I am the Holy One,\nand I am among you.” ',
