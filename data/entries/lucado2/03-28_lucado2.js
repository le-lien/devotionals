    "body": 'Oh, how God wants you to hear his music.\nHe has a rhythm that will race your heart and lyrics that will stir your tears. You want to journey to the stars? He can take you there. You want to lie down in peace? His music can soothe your soul.\nBut first, he’s got to get rid of that country-western stuff. (Forgive me, Nashville. Only an example.)\nAnd so he begins tossing the CDs. A friend turns away. The job goes bad.\nYour spouse doesn’t understand. The church is dull. One by one he removes the options until all you have left is God.\nHe would do that? Absolutely. If he must silence every voice, he will. He wants you to hear his music. ',
