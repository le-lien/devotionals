But the way we try to hide it, you would think it was a plague!\nThere are girdles which compact the middle-age spread for both sexes.\nThere are hair transplants, wigs, toupees, and hair pieces. Dentures bring youth to the mouth, wrinkle cream brings youth to the face, and color in a bottle brings youth to the hair.\nAll to hide what everyone already knows— we’re getting older… .\nJust when the truth about life sinks in, God’s truth starts to surface. He takes us by the hand and dares us not to sweep the facts under the rug but to confront them with him at our side.\nAging? A necessary process to pass on to a better world.\nDeath? Merely a brief passage, a tunnel.\nSelf? Designed and created for a purpose, purchased by God himself.\nThere, was that so bad? ',
