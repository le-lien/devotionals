Their great miracles? No.\nThe sign of the saved is their love for the least.\nThose put on the right hand of God will be those who gave food to the hungry, drink to the thirsty, warmth to the lonely, clothing to the naked, comfort to the sick, and friendship to the imprisoned.\nDid you note how simple the works are? Jesus doesn’t say, “I was sick and you healed me. . . . I was in prison and you liberated me. . . . I was lonely and you built a retirement home for me… .” He doesn’t say, “I was thirsty and you gave me spiritual counsel.”\nNo fanfare. No hoopla. No media coverage. Just good people doing good things. ',
