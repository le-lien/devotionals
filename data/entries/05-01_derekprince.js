    "body": 'Let’s consider the nature and scope of our redemption through Christ. Our Scripture for today is Galatians 3:13–14: Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a curse for us—for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree”—in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.\n(nasb)\nPaul was referring here to the law of Moses, detailed in the book of Deuteronomy, where God said that everyone who is put to death by hanging on a tree is under a curse. (The word tree also signifies a piece of wood that makes a cross.) The evidence that such a person is under the curse is that he is hanging visibly on a piece of wood.\nIn order to redeem us from the curse of the law, Christ became a curse for us. This was demonstrated visibly when He hung on the cross.\nIt was necessary for Him to become a curse because the curse of God follows all sin and disobedience against God.\nThe secret of what took place on the cross is that there was a divinely ordained exchange—something that could not be seen by the natural eye, but could be perceived only through the revelation of God through the Holy Spirit and the Scriptures. Christ became a curse—He took the curse due to our sin and disobedience—so that we, in return, through faith in Him, might have access to the blessing that was due to His sinless obedience.\nThank You, Jesus, for Your work on the cross. I proclaim that to redeem me from the curse of the law, Christ became a curse for me. ',
