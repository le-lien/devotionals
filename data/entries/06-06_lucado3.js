    "body": 'Pilate, the Roman governor confronted with a prisoner who agreed that he was a king, had a question. It is the question that rings throughout history:\n“What should I do with Jesus, the one called the Christ?” (Matthew 27:22\nNCV).\nPerhaps you, like Pilate, are curious about this one called Jesus. What do you do with a man who claims to be God yet hates religion? What do you do with a man who calls himself the Savior yet condemns systems? What do you do with a man who knows the place and time of his death yet goes there anyway?\nYou have two choices. You can reject him. That is an option. You can, as have many, decide that the idea of God’s becoming a carpenter is too weird—\nand walk away.\nOr you can accept him. You can journey with him. You can listen for his voice amid the hundreds of voices and follow him. ',
