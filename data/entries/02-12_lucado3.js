    "body": 'An accomplished Ironman triathlete told me the secret of his success. “You last the long race by running short ones.” Don’t swim 2.4 miles; just swim to the next buoy. Rather than bike 112 miles, ride 10, take a break, and bike 10 more. Never tackle more than the challenge ahead.\nDidn’t Jesus offer the same counsel? “So don’t ever worry about tomorrow. After all, tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own” (Matthew 6:34 GOD’S WORD).\nWhen asked how he managed to write so many books, Joel Henderson explained that he’d never written a book. All he did was write one page a day.3\nFace challenges in stages. You can’t control your temper forever, but you can control it for the next hour. Earning a high school or college degree can seem impossible, but studying one week at a time is doable. You last the long race by running the short ones. ',
