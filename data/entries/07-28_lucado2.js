Never did the obscene come so close to the holy as it did on Calvary. Never did the good in the world so intertwine with the bad as it did on the cross… .\nGod on a cross. Humanity at its worst. Divinity at its best… .\nGod is not stumped by an evil world. He doesn’t gasp in amazement at the depth of our faith or the depth of our failures. He knows the condition of the world . . . and loves it just the same. For just when we find a place where God would never be (like on a cross), we look again and there he is, in the flesh. ',
