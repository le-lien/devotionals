    "body": 'In Hebrews 3:1, we are admonished to make the right confession.\nThen, in Hebrews 4:14, we are told to “hold fast our confession.”\nWhen the Bible calls Jesus our High Priest, we immediately know that it is our confession that enlists His ministry on our behalf.\nIn holding fast our confession, we must not change what we have said. We must make the words of our mouths agree with what the Word of God says. In Hebrews 10:23, the step that we are now considering, it says, “Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering.”\nNotice what has been added: “without wavering.”\nIf we look through these passages of Hebrews in the order in which they appear, we find that, in respect to our confession, there are three successive stages. First, we make the confession; second, having made it, we hold it fast without changing it; and, third, we hold it fast without wavering.\nWhy was “without wavering”  put in? To me, on the basis of logic and personal experience, it implies that when we make the right confession, we are going to encounter negative forces and pressures that will come against us. Even though we have made the right confession and we are holding it fast, there may come a time when it seems like all the forces of Satan and the powers of darkness are turned loose against us. The temptation is to let go of our confession. But the writer said,\n“Don’t let go! Hold fast—without wavering.” The darker the situation and the greater the problem, the more important it is to hold fast without wavering.\nGod is faithful. He is committed to His Word. Jesus is our High Priest. If we will only hold fast our confession without wavering, He will do His job as our High Priest. ',
