    "body": 'Watch a small boy follow his dad through the snow. He stretches to step where his dad stepped. Not an easy task. His small legs extend as far as they can so his feet can fall in his father’s prints. The father, seeing what the son is doing, smiles and begins taking shorter steps, so the son can follow.\nIt’s a picture of discipleship. In our faith we follow in someone’s steps. A parent, a teacher, a hero—none of us are the first to walk the trail. All of us have someone we follow.\nIn our faith we leave footprints to guide others. A younger sister, a friend, a new Christian. They look up to us. They see that we have something they want and need. We do all we can to help them follow. Nobody should be left to walk the trail alone. ',
