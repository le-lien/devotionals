    "body": 'Wouldn’t a bride and groom have to be more married on their fiftieth anniversary than on their wedding day?\nYet, on the other hand, how could they be? The marriage certificate hasn’t matured. Ah, but the relationship has, and there is the difference.\nTechnically, they are no more united than they were when they left the altar.\nBut relationally, they are completely different.\nThe same is true of our walk with God. Can you be more saved than you were the first day of your salvation? No. But can a person grow in salvation? Absolutely. It, like marriage, is a done deal and a daily development. ',
