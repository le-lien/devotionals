They will be judged by the One they refused to worship. But children of God do not need to be afraid because Jesus has promised to take us home to heaven with Him.\nBut can we believe Jesus’ promise? How can we know He will do what He said? How can we believe He will save us and set us free from our sins?\nHow can we know He will come back?\nBecause He’s already come back once. Because the stone was rolled away and His tomb was empty. Because Jesus lives. ',
