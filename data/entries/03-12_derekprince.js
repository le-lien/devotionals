    "body": 'Leviticus 17:11 says, “The life of the flesh is in the blood.”  When Jesus poured out His blood, He poured out His life. As I understand it, the life of God was released into the universe. And no mind can really comprehend the fullness of what that means.\nThen Jesus said to them, “Most assuredly [of utmost importance] , I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in you. Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.”\n(John 6:53–54)\nBear in mind that our redemption is not complete until the resurrection. In Philippians 3:12, Paul said, “Not that I have already attained, or am already perfected; but I press on, that I may lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus has also laid hold of me,”  which is “the resurrection from the dead” (verse 11).\nSome people have the impression that their bodies are not very important. But God says our bodies are very important—they are temples for the Holy Spirit. They are “ fearfully and wonderfully made”  (Psalm 139:14). And God is not going to leave our bodies in a state of decay. He is going to resurrect them with glory like that of Jesus. Redemption is the full outworking of Jesus’ sacrifice, and it is consummated by the resurrection. ',
