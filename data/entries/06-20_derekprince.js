    "body": 'Often, the measure of God’s commitment to you is determined by the measure of your commitment to Him. God never makes partial commitments, and He does not want any partial commitments.\nGod has established the price of a relationship with Him. It is everything you have. “He…that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple” (Luke 14:33 kjv).\nYou may say, “That sounds hard.” But it is realistic. Let me tell you two facts about God’s kingdom. First of all, God never has a sale. He never reduces the price on any item. If you want the relationship that Peter, Paul, and John had with the Lord, you must pay what they paid.\nGod has not offered a discount.\nThe second fact is good news: in God’s kingdom, there is no inflation. The price has never gone up, and it has never gone down. It is always the same.\nThe outcome of a commitment to God is peace, security, and joy.\nDo you want it? You have to make the decision. Jesus said, Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.\n(Revelation 3:20 kjv)\nNotice the order Jesus established in this verse. First, you give Jesus your supper, and then He gives you His. As Jesus said to His Father,  “All Mine are Yours, and Yours are Mine”  (John 17:10). Are you willing to make that kind of commitment to God?\nThank You, Jesus, that You have redeemed me. I proclaim that I am willing to pay the price of total commitment to that relationship, for I am a friend of Christ. Amen. ',
