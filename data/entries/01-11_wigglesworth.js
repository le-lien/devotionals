    "body": 'remember a person who had not been able to smell anything for four years. I said, "You will smell now if you be-I lieve." She went about smelling everything and was quite excited. The next day she gave her testimony.\n\nAnother came and asked, "Is it possible for God to heal my ears?" The eardrums had been removed. I said, "Only believe." She went down into the audience in great distress; others were healed, but she could not hear. The next night she came again. She said, "I am going to believe tonight." The glory fell. The first time she came feeling; the second time she came believing.\n\nAt one place, there was a man anointed with oil for a rupture. He came the next night and rose in the meeting saying, "This man is an impostor. He is deceiving the people. He told me last night I was healed; I am worse than ever today." I spoke to the evil power that held the man and rebuked it, telling the man he was indeed healed. He was a stonemason. The next day, he testified to lifting heavy weights and that God had met him. “By His stripes we are healed.…And the LORD has laid on Him the iniquity of us all”  (Isa. 53:5–6). He was against the Word of God, not me.\n\n“„What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?‟ Jesus answered and said to them, „This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He sent‟”  (John 6:28–29). Anything else? Yes. He took our infirmities and healed all our diseases. I myself am a marvel of healing. If I fail to glorify God, the stones will cry out. (See Luke 19:37–40.) Salvation is for all. Healing is for all. The baptism of the Holy Spirit is for all.\n\nConsider yourselves dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God (Rom. 6:11). By His grace you will get the victory every time. It is possible to live a holy life.',
