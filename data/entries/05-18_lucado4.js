And for God, there’s no going back.\nGod’s grace is a come-as-you-are promise from a one-of-a-kind God.\nYou’ve been found. You’ve been called—His Spirit has touched your heart and made you want to follow Him. And you’ve been adopted  by Him.\nSo trust your Father and claim this verse as your own: “Christ died for us while we were still sinners. In this way God shows his great love for us” ',
