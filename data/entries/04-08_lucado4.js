Do you see the girl who didn’t stand up for a friend when she was being made fun of?\nWhen your eyes look in the mirror, do you see a promise-breaker? A bad friend? Someone who has messed up … again … and again … and again?\nIf you do, then please look once more. But this time look through the eyes of faith. See what God sees. He sees His much-loved child, the one He sent His Son to save.\nYour eyes see your mistakes. But God’s eyes see the child He loves.\nYour eyes see your sin and guilt. But God’s eyes see someone washed clean by the sacrifice of Jesus. ',
