    "body": 'Many Christians live with anxiety. Why? They’re worried about eternity.\nThey think they are saved, hope they are saved, but still they doubt, wondering, Am I really saved?\nIt’s a universal question. Kids who accept Christ ask it. Rebels ask it. It surfaces in the heart of the struggler. It seeps into the thoughts of the dying.\nWhen we forget our vow to God, does God forget us? Is our ticket still good, or are heaven’s doors closed?\nJesus’ language couldn’t be stronger. “And I give them eternal life, and they shall never lose it or perish throughout the ages… . And no one is able to snatch them out of My hand” (John 10:28 AMP).\nJesus promised a new life that could not be lost or terminated. Bridges are burned, and the transfer is accomplished. Ups and downs may mark our days, but they will never ban us from his kingdom. Jesus bottom-lines our lives with grace. ',
