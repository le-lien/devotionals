You worry that:\nYour parents won’t understand.\nYour classmates will make fun of you.\nYou won’t ever be as gifted as your friends are.\nYou won’t ever make a difference.\nWorry makes you think about the things you  want rather than the things God  wants for you. You become more interested in what others think of you than what God thinks of you. You may even find yourself jealous of a friend’s gifts and doubting God’s plan.\nGod has given you talents. He has done the same for your friend. If you focus on your friend’s talents, you won’t see your own. But if you focus on your  talents—on the gifts that God has given to you—you could inspire both yourself and your friend. ',
