    "body": 'The Devil will endeavor to fascinate people through the eyes and the mind. One time a beautiful young woman was T brought to me who had been infatuated with some preacher; just because he had not been interested in marrying her, the Devil had taken advantage of the situation and had made her delirious. She had been brought by friends 250 miles in that condition. She had previously received the baptism in the Spirit.\n\nYou ask, "Is there any place for the Enemy in one who has been baptized in the Holy Spirit?" Our only safety is in going on with God and in constantly being filled with the Holy Spirit. You must not forget Demas. He must have been baptized with the Holy Spirit, for he appears to have been one of Paul‘s right-hand workers, but the Enemy got him to the place where he loved this present world, and he fell away (2 Tim. 4:10).\n\nWhen they brought this young woman to me, I discerned the evil power right away and immediately cast the thing out in the name of Jesus. It was a great joy to present her before all the people in her right mind again.\n\nThere is a life of perfect deliverance, and this is where God wants you to be. If I find that my peace is disturbed in any way, I know it is the Enemy who is trying to work. How do I know this? Because the Lord has promised to keep your mind in perfect peace when it is focused on Him (Isaiah 26:3). Paul told us to present our bodies as “a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is [our] reasonable service”  (Rom. 12:1). The Holy Spirit also spoke this word through Paul: “And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God” (v. 2).',
