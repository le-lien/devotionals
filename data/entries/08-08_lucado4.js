    "body": 'Don’t you just love that verse? “When Jesus was raised from the dead it was a signal”—a signal that He had defeated death!\nThe resurrection of Jesus is like an exploding signal flare shot into the sky. It tells all of us who are truly searching for Christ that it is safe to believe. Safe to believe in eternal justice. Safe to believe in eternal life. Safe to believe in heaven as our home and the earth as its front porch. Safe to believe in a time when questions and worries won’t keep us awake. Safe to believe in a time when pain and sickness won’t keep us down. Safe to believe in endless days and real praise. ',

      "text": 'Growing in Grace Reread one of your favorite Bible stories. Maybe it’s the story of Daniel and the lions, Paul on the road to Damascus, or Jesus calming the storm. After you read it, take time to think about how these aren’t just stories like Cinderella and Aladdin. These were real people and real events—serving a real God.'
