It’s like you were standing on the edge of the cliff, trying to make a decision, and the ground of your goodness just crumbled under your feet. The ledge gave way, and down you went. Poof!\nNow what do you do? When you fall, you can forget it. You can fib about it. Or you can face it.\nWe can keep no secrets from God. Confession is not telling God what we did. He already knows. Confession is simply agreeing with God that what we did was wrong.\nHow can God forgive if we don’t admit our guilt? Ahh, there’s that word: guilt. Isn’t that what we want to avoid? What we hate? But is guilt so bad?\nGuilt simply means that we know right from wrong, that we hope to do better next time. Guilt is a healthy sorrow for telling God one thing but then doing another. ',
