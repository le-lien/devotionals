And for God, there’s no going back. His grace is a come-as-you-are promise from a one-of-a-kind King. You’ve been found, called, and adopted; so trust your Father and claim this verse as your own: “God showed his love for us in this way: Christ died for us while we were still sinners” (Rom. 5:8). And you never again have to wonder who your father is—you’ve been adopted by God and are therefore an “heir of God through Christ” (Gal.4:7). ',
