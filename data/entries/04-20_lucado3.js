    "body": 'Following Christ demands faith, but not blind faith. Take a look at the vacated tomb. Did you know the opponents of Christ never challenged that it was empty? No Pharisee or Roman soldier ever led a group back to the burial site and declared, “The angel was wrong. The body is here. It was all a rumor.”\nThey would have if they could have. Within weeks, disciples occupied every Jerusalem street corner, announcing a risen Christ. What quicker way for the enemies of the church to shut them up than to produce a cold and lifeless body? But they had no cadaver to display.\nNo wonder there was a Jerusalem revival. When the apostles argued for the empty tomb, the people looked to the Pharisees to deny it. They never did.\nAs A. M. Fairbairn put it long ago, “The silence of the Jews is as eloquent as the speech of the Christians!” ',
