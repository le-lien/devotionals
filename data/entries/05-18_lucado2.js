    "body": 'The people God used to change history were a ragbag of ne’er-do-wells and has-beens who found hope, not in their performance, but in God’s proverbially open arms.\nLet’s start with Abraham. Though eulogized by Paul for his faith, this Father of a Nation wasn’t without his weaknesses. He had a fibbing tongue that wouldn’t stop! One time, in order to save his neck, he let the word get out that Sarah wasn’t his wife but his sister, which was only half true. And then, not long later, he did it again! “And there Abraham said of his wife Sarah, ‘She is my sister.’”\nTwice he traded in his integrity for security. That’s what you call confidence in God’s promises? Can you build a nation on that kind of faith?\nGod can. God took what was good and forgave what was bad and used “old forked tongue” to start a nation. ',
