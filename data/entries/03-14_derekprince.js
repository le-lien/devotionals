    "body": 'Four times in John 6, Jesus said about the believer, “I will raise him up at the last day.” (See verses 39, 40, 44, and 54.) Resurrection is a part of salvation.\nWhoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. For My flesh is food indeed\n[true food] , and My blood is drink indeed [true drink] . He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and I in him.\n(John 6:54–56)\nThe words eats, drinks, and abides are in the continuing present tense: “He who continually feeds on My flesh, and continually drinks My blood, continually abides in Me and I in him.”\nIt is very clear that the Lord attaches tremendous importance to feeding on His flesh and drinking His blood. I am not the final authority, but I really believe He is talking about the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, or Communion.\nAt one time, I lived in an Arab town with Arab Christians. When they took the Lord’s Supper, they said, “Let us drink the blood of Jesus.”\nI believe those Arab Christians got the right picture. Drinking the blood of Jesus is Communion.\nSomething in us says, “I don’t like the thought of drinking blood.” I remember that it took me years to come to grips with this statement. But to have eternal life, we have to drink Jesus’ blood and feed on His flesh. ',
