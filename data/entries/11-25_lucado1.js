    "body": '[The stadium] is packed today. Since Friday, [Mark] McGwire has hit not one or two home runs, but three. For thirty-seven years, no one could hit more than sixty-one homers in one season; now the St. Louis slugger has hit sixty-eight. And he isn’t finished… . The fans are on their feet before he comes to bat; they stay on their feet long after he crosses the plate… .\nNot everyone can be a Mark McGwire. For every million who aspire, only one achieves. The vast majority of us don’t hit the big ball, don’t feel the ticker tape, don’t wear the gold medal, don’t give the valedictory address.\nAnd that’s OK. We understand that in the economy of earth, there are a limited number of crowns.\nThe economy of heaven, however, is refreshingly different. Heavenly rewards are not limited to a chosen few, but “to all those who have waited with love for him to come again” (2 Tim. 4:8). ',
