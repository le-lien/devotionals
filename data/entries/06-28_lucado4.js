Do flames of hate burn your heart?\nDoes your face burn red and hot?\nOr do you reach up to Jesus? Do you ask Him to help you control the angry fire? Do you pull out a bucket of mercy—and throw it on the angry flames? Do you put out the fire?\nDon’t get on the roller coaster of anger. Be the one who says, “Yes, he treated me wrong, but I am going to be like Christ. I’ll be the one who says,\n‘Father, forgive them. They don’t know what they are doing’ ” (Luke 23:34).\nIf Jesus could look down from the cross and say those words, then so can you. Ask Him to help you put out the fire. ',
