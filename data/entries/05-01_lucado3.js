    "body": 'If hurts were hairs, we’d all look like grizzlies. After all, aren’t there so many? When friends mock the way you dress, their insults hurt. When teachers ignore your work, their neglect hurts. When your mom embarrasses you, when your girlfriend snubs you, when your boyfriend drops you, it hurts.\nSo how will you respond?\nBuild a prison of hate if you want, each brick a hurt. Design it with one cell and a single bunk. (You won’t attract roommates.) Hang large video screens on each of the four walls so recorded images of the offense can play over and over. Appealing? No, appalling. It will leave you bitter, bent, and angry.\nInstead, give the grace you’ve been given. You don’t approve of the deeds of your offender when you do. Jesus didn’t approve your sins by forgiving you. Grace is not blind. It sees the hurt full well. But grace chooses to see God’s forgiveness even more. Where grace is lacking, bitterness abounds.\nWhere grace abounds, forgiveness grows. ',
