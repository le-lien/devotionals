It is a choice to believe that the one who made it all hasn’t left it all and that he still sends light into the shadows and responds to gestures of faith… .\nFaith is the belief that God will do what is right.\nGod says that the more hopeless your circumstances, the more likely your salvation. The greater your cares, the more genuine your prayers. The darker the room, the greater the need for light.\nGod’s help is near and always available, but it is only given to those who seek it. ',
