    "body": 'here is the prophecy that is the testimony of the saved person regarding what Jesus has done for him. Everyone, every T newborn soul, has this kind of prophecy. Through the new birth that results in righteousness, God has given an anointing of the Spirit, a real unction of the Spirit of Christ. We felt when we were saved that we wanted everybody to be saved. That mindset has to be continuous; the whole world can be regenerated by the spirit of prophecy as we testify of our salvation in Christ.\n\nThis is the same prophecy that Paul spoke about in 1 Corinthians 14:1: “Pursue love, and desire spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.”  This verse identifies prophecy as being more important than other gifts. Think about that: prophecy is to be chosen   and desired above all the   other gifts; the greatest among all the gifts is prophecy.\n\nWhy prophecy? Because prophecy by the power of the Spirit is the only power that saves humanity. We are told in the Word of God that the Gospel that is presented through prophecy has power to bring immortality and light. (See 2 Timothy 1:10.) Immortality is what abides forever. Light is what opens the understanding of your heart. Light and immortality come by the Gospel.\n\nProphecy is to be desired above all things, and every Christian has to have it. Every believer may have gifts, though there are very few who do; however, every believer has testimonial prophecy.\n\nLooking at Revelation 19:10, let us see what testimonial prophecy is and how it comes forth. “I fell at his feet.”  Who is this inhabitant of heaven? The one speaking to John is a man who has been on the earth. Lots of people are foolishly led by the Devil to believe that after they die, their spirits will be asleep in the grave; this is absolutely contrary to the Word of God. Don‘t you know that even if you live until the Lord comes, the body that you have must 485\n\nbe put off and another must be put on, because you cannot go into heaven with your present body?\n\nThis man has   been in the earth in the body and is now in heaven in the spirit, and he wants you to hear what he has to say: “I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren who have the testimony of Jesus….For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.” What is the testimony of Jesus? The testimony is: "Jesus has saved me." What the world wants to know today is how they can be saved.\n\nTestify that you are saved. Your knees may knock together, you may be trembling as you do it, but when you get it out, you enter into the spirit of prophecy. Before you know where you are, you are saying things that the Spirit is saying.\n\nThere are thousands of Christians who have never received the baptism of the Holy Spirit but who have this wonderful spirit of prophecy. People are being saved everywhere by the testimony of such believers. If you cease from testifying, you will be sorry when you give an account of your life before God (Rom. 14:12). As you testify, you will be a vessel through which the power of God can bring salvation to people (Rom. 1:16). Testify wherever you are.\n\nLive in the place where the Lord your God moves you, not to go from house to house nor speak from person to person, but where the Lord directs you, for He has the person who is in need of truth waiting for watering with your watering can. Do not forget that you are “ambassadors for Christ”  (2 Cor. 5:20).',
