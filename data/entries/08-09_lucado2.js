But you and I were, we had, and we did. We were left with nothing to offer but a prayer… .\n“He changed places with us.” He wore our sin so we could wear his righteousness.\nThough we come to the cross dressed in sin, we leave the cross dressed in the “coat of his strong love” (Isa. 59:17) and girded with a belt of\n“goodness and fairness” (Isa. 11:5) and clothed in “garments of salvation”\n(Isa. 61:10 NIV).\nIndeed, we leave dressed in Christ himself. “You have all put on Christ as a garment” (Gal. 3:27 NEB).
