    "body": 'One gets the impression that to John, Jesus was above all a loyal companion. Messiah? Yes. Son of God? Indeed. Miracle worker? That too. But more than anything, Jesus was a pal. Someone you could go camping with or bowling with or count the stars with.\nSo what do you do with a friend like that? Well, that’s rather simple. You stick by him. Maybe that’s why John is the only one of the twelve who was at the cross. He came to say good-bye. By his own admission he hadn’t quite put the pieces together yet. But that didn’t really matter. As far as he was concerned, his closest friend was in trouble, and he came to help.\nDying on the cross, Jesus asked John, “Can you take care of my mother?”\nJohn must have said yes because “from that time on, this disciple took her into his home” (John 19:27 NIV).\nOf course he did. That’s what friends are for. ',
