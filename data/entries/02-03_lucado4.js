But you’ve never won anything really big. You’ve watched the stars of this world carry home the trophies and the blue ribbons. All you have are “almosts” and “could-have-beens.”\nIf that sounds like you, then you’ll love this promise: “When Christ, the Head Shepherd, comes, you will get a crown. This crown will be glorious, and it will never lose its beauty” (1 Peter 5:4).\nYour turn is coming! The world may not see how great you are, but your Father does. And sooner than you can imagine, you will be blessed by Him! ',
