    "body": 'When we comprehend the completeness of God’s knowledge—\nHis foreknowledge, in particular—it gives us the assurance that no matter what happens, God is never taken by surprise. There is no such thing as an emergency in the kingdom of heaven. Not only does God know the end from the beginning, but He Himself is both “the Beginning and the End”  (Revelation 21:6). And He is always in total control.\nGod specifically knows those whom He has chosen to be with Him in eternity. “For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brethren”  (Romans 8:29).\nIf, by the mercy and grace of God, we make it through to that glorious, eternal destination, Jesus will never greet any one of us with the words, “I never expected to see you  here!” Rather, He will say, “My child, I’ve been waiting for you. We couldn’t sit down to the marriage feast until you came.” At that glorious banquet, I believe that every place setting will carry the name of the person for whom it is prepared. ',
