    "body": 'We regularly face subtle yet significant decisions, all of which fall under the category of who comes first: do they or do I? When you eat lunch with the neglected kids rather than the cool ones. When you spend your Saturday with your grandmother at the dementia unit. When you turn away from personal dreams for the sake of others, you are denying yourself. “If any of you wants to be my follower, you must turn from your selfish ways, take up your cross, and follow me” (Matthew 16:24 NLT).\nBehold the most surprising ingredient of a great day: self-denial.\nDon’t we assume just the opposite? Great days emerge from the soil of self-interest, self-expression, and self-celebration. But deny yourself? When was the last time you read this ad copy: “Go ahead. Deny yourself and have the time of your life!”?\nJesus could have written the words. In his world the least are the greatest (Luke 9:48); the last will be first (Mark 9:35); the chosen seats are the forgotten seats (Luke 14:8–9). Does he have it backward? What do you think? ',
