There is nothing unique about this ball. For all I know it was bought at a discount sports store. What makes it unique is the signatures.\nThe same is true with us. In the scheme of nature Homo sapiens  are not unique. We aren’t the only creatures with flesh and hair and blood and hearts. What makes us special is not only our body but the signature of God on our lives. We are his works of art. We are created in his image to do good deeds. We are significant, not because of what we do, but because of whose we are. ',
