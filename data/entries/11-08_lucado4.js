As believers, you and I will live in heaven after our time on earth, but Jesus did just the opposite. He knew heaven before  He came to earth. He knew what was waiting for Him when He returned. And knowing what was waiting for Him in heaven made Him able to bear the shame and suffering on earth.\n“He accepted the shame of the cross as if it were nothing. He did this because of the joy that God put before him” (Hebrews 12:2).\nIn His last moments on the cross, Jesus focused on the joy of heaven. He kept His eyes on the prize of returning to God. By focusing on the prize, He was able not only to finish the race but also to win it. ',
