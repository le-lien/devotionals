    "body": 'Something holy happens around a dinner table that will never happen in a church. In a church auditorium you see the backs of heads. Around the table you see the expressions on faces. In the auditorium one person speaks; around the table everyone has a voice. Church services are on the clock.\nAround the table there is time to talk.\nHospitality opens the door to uncommon community.\nIt’s no accident that hospitality and hospital come from the same Latin word, for they both lead to the same result: healing. When you open your door to someone, you are sending this message: “You matter to me and to God.” You may think you are saying, “Come over for a visit.” But what your guest hears is, “I’m worth the effort.”\nDo you know people who need this message? A boy who’s just moved to your school? A girl who always eats lunch alone? A classmate who’s lost her mother? Some people pass an entire day with no meaningful contact with anyone else. Your hospitality can be their hospital. ',
