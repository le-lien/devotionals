One after the other the rising swells of salt water gain momentum, humping, rising, then standing to salute the beach before crashing onto the sand. How many billions of times has this simple mystery repeated itself since time began?\nIn the distance lies a miracle of colors— twins of blue. The ocean-blue of the Atlantic encounters the pale blue of the sky, separated only by the horizon… .\nMiracles. Divine miracles.\nThese are miracles because they are mysteries. Scientifically explainable? Yes. Reproducible? To a degree.\nBut still they are mysteries. Events that stretch beyond our understanding and find their origins in another realm. They are every bit as divine as divided seas, walking cripples, and empty tombs. ',
