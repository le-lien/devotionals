It holds the whole thing up.\nYou see, God’s promise to those who choose to follow Jesus is a simple one: because Jesus was raised from the dead— resurrected—we, too, will rise from death and go to live in heaven with Him.\nBut can we trust that promise? How do we know the resurrection was real? That isn’t just a good question. It is the  best question. Paul wrote, “If Christ has not been raised, then your faith is for nothing; you are still guilty of your sins” (1 Corinthians 15:17).\nIn other words, if Christ has been raised from the dead, then His followers will join Him in heaven. But if He has not been raised, then His followers are lost forever. ',
