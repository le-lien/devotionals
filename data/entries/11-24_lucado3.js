    "body": 'The Israelites considered the name Yahweh too holy to be spoken by human lips. Whenever they needed to say Yahweh, they substituted the word Adonai, which means “Lord.” If the name needed to be written, the scribes would take a bath before they wrote it and destroy the pen afterward.\nDo we treat God with the same respect today? Are we still in awe of the Almighty? I wonder if we’ve lost our wonder. Our society practically worships the modern celebrity. Whether it’s a movie star, a rock icon, or a top athlete, we roar with appreciation when they appear on the screen, stage, or field. Do we worship in church with the same intensity?\nMoses sang, “Who among the gods is like you, LORD? Who is like you majestic in holiness, awesome in glory, working wonders?” (Exodus 15:11\nNIV). The Israelites did not dare even to say his name. Surely we can dare to show him our love, appreciation, and respect. ',
