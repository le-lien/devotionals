Was he required to put stripes on the zebra and the hump on the camel?... Why wrap creation in such splendor? Why go to such trouble to give such gifts?\nWhy do you? You do the same. I’ve seen you searching for a gift. I’ve seen you stalking the malls and walking the aisles. I’m not talking about the obligatory gifts... I’m talking about that extra-special person and that extra-special gift... Why do you do it?... You do it so the heart will stop. You do it so the jaw will drop. You do it to hear those words of disbelief, “You did this for me? ”\nThat’s why you do it. And that is why God did it. Next time a sunrise steals your breath or a meadow of flowers leaves you speechless, remain that way. Say nothing and listen as heaven whispers, “Do you like it? I did it just for you.”',
