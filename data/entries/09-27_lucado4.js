Ask Job.\nHe lost everything, his children were killed, and his once healthy body was covered with boils and sores. Where did this misery come from? And where would help come from?\nJob went straight to God and told Him his troubles. His head hurt. His body hurt. His heart hurt.\nAnd God answered. Not with answers, but with questions. A whole ocean of questions!\nAfter dozens of questions, Job got the point. What is it?\nThe point is this: God doesn’t owe anyone anything. No reasons. No explanations. Nothing. If He gave them, we wouldn’t be able to understand them anyway.\nGod is God. He knows what He is doing. And even when you don’t understand, trust His heart and His love for you. ',

Can you pour water from the jars of heaven? Can you set a path for the thunderstorm to follow? God can. So trust Him to do what’s best for you.'
