    "body": 'God became a baby. He entered a world. . . of problems and heartaches.\n“The Word became human and lived here on earth among us. He was full of unfailing love and faithfulness” (John 1:14 NLT).\nThe operative word of the verse is among. He lived among  us. He donned the costliest of robes: a human body. He made a throne out of a manger and a royal court out of some cows. He took a common name—Jesus—and made it holy. He took common people and made them the same. He could have lived over us or away from us. But he didn’t. He lived among  us.\nHe became a friend of the sinner and brother of the poor. ',
