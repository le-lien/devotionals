He doesn’t want to be your vacation spot or even the place you hope to live someday when you’re older.\nHe wants to be the place where you live all the time—starting right now. He wants to be the place that you come to for answers, for help, and for comfort. He wants to be your home.\nFor many people this is a new way of thinking. They only think of God as Someone to talk about or to pray to. He is just Someone they visit on Sundays or holidays. He is a miracle worker, not a place  to live. But your Father wants to be much more. Your Father wants you to live with Him all the time (Acts 17:28). God wants to be the home that you carry with you wherever you go. ',
