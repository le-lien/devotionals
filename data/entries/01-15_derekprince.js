    "body": 'In Ephesians 1:7, we see this provision of the blood of Jesus: In Him [Christ] we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace.\nThe forgiveness of our sins is purchased for us by the blood of Jesus. Compare this verse with what Jesus said at the Last Supper in Matthew 26:28 as He gave the disciples the cup, which was the emblem of His blood:\nFor this is My blood of the new covenant [testament] , which is shed for many for the remission [forgiveness]  of sins.\n(Matthew 26:28)\nHebrews 9:22 says that without shedding of blood, there is no remission of sin. So the blood of Jesus was shed that our sins might be forgiven.\nYou will notice that in Ephesians 1:7, Paul made these two things coextensive: redemption through the blood of Jesus and the forgiveness of sins. This is very important to understand because we have the full legal rights of redemption only insofar as our sins are forgiven.\nThank You, Lord, for the blood of Jesus. I proclaim that because all my sins are forgiven by His blood, I now have the full legal rights of redemption. Through the blood of Jesus, all my sins are forgiven. Amen. ',
