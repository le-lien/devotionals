If God has to choose between your eternal safety and your earthly comfort, which do you hope he chooses?\nWhat if he moved you to another land? (As he did Abraham.) What if he called you to confront an ornery ruler? (Remember Moses?) How about a ride in the bowel of a fish? (You’ve heard of Jonah.) A promotion like Daniel’s? A demotion like Samson’s?\nGod does whatever it takes to get our attention. Isn’t that the message of the Bible? The relentless pursuit of God. God on the hunt. God in the search.\nPeeking under the bed for hiding kids, stirring the bushes for lost sheep. Have you thought about this? Your illness, your heavy homework load, your long list of rejections—all could be God waving his hand, letting you know it’s time to come back and spend time with him.\nAren’t you glad he’s still there?\nONE MORE THOUGHT\nGod won’t make you walk with him. He’s too much of a gentleman for that. ',
