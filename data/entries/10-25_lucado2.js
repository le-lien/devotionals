It will be the word that closes one age and opens a new one.\nI think I know what the command will be. I could very well be wrong, but I think the command that puts an end to the pains of the earth and initiates the joys of heaven will be two words: “No more.”\nThe King of kings will raise his pierced hand and proclaim, “No more.”\nThe angels will stand and the Father will speak, “No more.”\nEvery person who lives and who ever lived will turn toward the sky and hear God announce, “No more.”\nNo more loneliness.\nNo more tears.\nNo more death. No more sadness. No more crying. No more pain. ',
