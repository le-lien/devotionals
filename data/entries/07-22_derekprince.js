If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I am not a part of the body,” it is not for this reason any the less a part of the body. And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I am not a part of the body,” it is not for this reason any the less a part of the body.\nIf the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be? But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, just as He desired.\n(1 Corinthians 12:12, 14–18 nasb)\nThere are three things we need to see in this statement of Paul. First, the choice of where and what we are to be in the body is not ours, but God’s. God has arranged the members of His body and assigned their functions. It is not for us to decide; rather, God decides and reveals His decisions to us.\nSecond, as this comes to pass in our lives, we merge our lives in a larger entity, the body—yet we still retain our individuality. It is like a little finger that finds its place on a hand, side-by-side with four other fingers, and is thus connected to the total life and purpose of a complete body. As Christians, we never lose our individual identities, but we do become a part of a larger, corporate group, all the while being the particular members that God ordained us to be.\nThird, as a corporate body, we are able to represent Christ in His fullness to the world. None of us can adequately represent Christ on our own; but when we are united to a body, that body can totally, corporately, and fully represent Jesus Christ to our world.\nThank You, Jesus, for making me a part of Your body. I proclaim that God has placed me, with an individual identity, as part of the whole, representing Christ in His fullness to the world.\nI am a member of the body of Christ. Amen.\nHow to Find God’s Plan for Your Life (audio)\n240\nDECLARING GOD’S WORD\nDeclaring God’s Word text_vNZ.indd 240\n4/09/2013 11:38:21 a.m.\nWEEK 30:\nI am holy.\nHe chose us in Him before the foundation ',
