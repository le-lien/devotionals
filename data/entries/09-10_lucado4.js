And sometimes we find ourselves asking, “Why is life so hard?”\nSo God gives us moments of joy. The loving hug of a parent, the comfort of a true friend, the warm sunshine on our back. These are His gifts of hope to us—like tiny slivers of light breaking through the window of heaven.\nGod gives us these glimpses of joy to give us hope and keep us going. He is saying to us, “If you think this is good, just wait and see what I have for you in heaven.”\nAs Paul quoted, “No one has ever imagined what God has prepared for those who love him” (1 Corinthians 2:9).
