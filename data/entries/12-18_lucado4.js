He was still in Mary’s tummy when the innkeeper said, “We don’t have room for You.”\nAnd when He was hung on the cross, the message was much the same:\n“We don’t have room for You in this world.”\nEven today Jesus is treated the same way. He goes from person to person, from heart to heart, knocking and asking if He can come in. ',

And to that person Jesus gives this great promise: “There are many rooms in my Father’s house… . I am going there to prepare a place for you” (John 14:2). What a wonderful promise He gives us! We make room for Him in our hearts, and He makes room for us in His house.',
