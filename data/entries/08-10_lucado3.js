    "body": 'My father let me climb onto his lap … when he drove! Half a century ago, no one cared. Especially on a flat-as-a-skillet West Texas oil field where rabbits outnumber people.\nI loved it. Did it matter that I couldn’t see over the dash? That my feet stopped two feet shy of the brake and accelerator? Not at all. I helped my dad drive his truck. Did I fear driving into the ditch? Overturning the curve?\nRunning the tire into a rut? Not at all. Dad’s hands were next to mine, his eyes keener than mine. I was fearless! Anyone can drive a car from the lap of a father.\nAnd anyone can pray from the same perspective. Prayer is the practice of sitting calmly in God’s lap and placing our hands on his steering wheel. He handles the speed and hard curves and ensures safe arrival. And we offer our requests; we ask God to “take this cup away” (Mark 14:36). This cup of disease, betrayal, rejection, conflict, or insecurity. Prayer is this simple. ',
