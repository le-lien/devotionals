    "body": 'Jeremiah was depressed, as gloomy as a giraffe with a neck ache. Jerusalem was under siege, his nation threatened, his world collapsing like a sandcastle in a typhoon. He blamed God for his emotional distress and his physical problems. “He [God] turned me into a scarecrow of skin and bones, then broke the bones” (Lamentations 3:4 MSG).\nJeremiah realized how fast he was sinking, so he looked in a new direction. “There’s one other thing I remember, and remembering, I keep a grip on hope: GOD’S loyal love couldn’t have run out, his merciful love couldn’t have dried up. They’re created new every morning. How great your faithfulness! I’m sticking with GOD (I say it over and over)” (vv. 21–24\nMSG).\nWhen depressed, Jeremiah rebooted his thoughts. He turned his eyes away from his stormy world and stared into the wonder of God and his promises: God’s love never hits bottom. His mercy never ends. They’re renewed every morning because he’s so faithful.\nGuess what? The storm didn’t stop, but Jeremiah’s discouragement did.\nSo can yours. ',
