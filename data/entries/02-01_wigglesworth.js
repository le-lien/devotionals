    "body": 'The words of Jesus are life—never think they are less. If you believe them, you will feel quickened. The Word is powerful; T it is full of faith. The Word of God is vital. Faith is established and made manifest as we hear the Word. Beloved, read the Word of God in quietude, and read it out loud, for “he who hears My word”  (John 5:24), to him it gives life.\n\nListen to these words from Scripture: “With fervent desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer”  (Luke 22:15); “The hour has come; behold, the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners”  (Mark 14:41). From the beginning of time, there has never been an hour like this. These words were among the greatest that Jesus ever spoke: “The hour has come.”\n\nTime was finished and eternity had begun for every soul that was covered with the blood. Until that hour, all people lived only to die, but the moment the sacrifice was made, it was not the end but only the beginning. The soul, covered with the blood, has moved from a natural to an eternal union with the Lord. Instead of death will be the fullness of life divine.\n\nWhile I was in Jerusalem, I preached many weeks outside the Damascus Gate, and God mightily blessed my ministry. It is wonderful to be in the place where God can use you. As I was leaving Jerusalem, some Jews who had heard me preach wanted to travel with me and stay at the same hotel where I was staying. When we were sitting around the table eating, they said, "What we cannot understand is that when you preach we feel such power. You move us. There is something about it; we cannot help but feel that you have something different from what we have been used to hearing. What is it?"\n\nI replied that it was because I preached Jesus in the power of the Holy Spirit, for He was the Messiah, and He causes a child of His to live in the reality of a clear knowledge of Himself so that others know and feel His power. It is this knowledge that the church today needs so much.\n\nDo not be satisfied with anything less than the knowledge of a real change in your nature, the knowledge of the indwelling presence and power of the Holy Spirit. Do not be satisfied with a life that is not wholly swallowed up in God.\n\nThere are many books written about the Word, and we love clear, definite teaching on it. But go to the Book, and listen to what the Master says. You will lay a sure foundation that cannot be moved, for we are born again by the incorruptible Word of God (1 Pet. 1:23). We need the simplicity, the rest of faith, that brings us to the place where we are steadfast and immovable. How wonderful the living Word of God is!\n\nCan you not see that the Master was so interested in you that He would despise the shame of the cross (Heb. 12:2)? The judgment hall was nothing to Him; all the rebukes and scorn could not take from Him the joy of saving you and me. His sacrificial love and joy caused Him to say, "I consider nothing too vile to endure on behalf of Wigglesworth; I count nothing too horrid to bear for Brown; My soul is on the wing to save the world!" How beautiful this is! How it should thrill us! He knew that death was represented in that sacred cup, yet He joyfully said, “With fervent desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer” (Luke 22:15). Take the bread, drink of the cup, and as often as you take it, remember (1 Cor. 11:24–25). In other words, take the memory of what it means home with you; think on it, and analyze its meaning.\n\nAs we come to the time of the breaking of bread, the thought should be, "How should I partake of it?" We should be able to say, "Lord, I desire to eat it to please You, for I want my whole life to be for You!" As the stream of the new life begins to flow through your being, allow yourself to be immersed and carried on until your life becomes a ceaseless flow of the river of life. Then it will be “No longer I who live…but Christ lives in me”  (Gal. 2:20). Get ready for the breaking of bread and for partaking of the wine, and in doing so, remember Him.',
