On that day all other voices will be silent.\nHis voice—and only His voice—will be heard.\nSome people will hear His voice for the very first time. It’s not that He never spoke to them. It’s just that they never listened. Jesus will be a stranger to them. They will hear Him that one time—and then they will never hear Him again. They will spend eternity without Jesus.\nBut other people will hear Jesus’ voice and will know who it is. They have been listening to Him and following Him because they are like the sheep who know the voice of their shepherd. Jesus will call His sheep by their names (John 10:3), and they will follow Him. And this time, they will follow Him into heaven.\nGrowing in Grace\nSheep follow their shepherd because they know his voice. Play a game of sheep-and-shepherd with a friend. Set up an obstacle course, and blindfold the sheep. Can you make it through the obstacle course just by following the shepherd’s voice? ',
