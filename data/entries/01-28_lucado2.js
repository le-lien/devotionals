Shame seeks to be avoided.\nBut don’t be fooled, the emotions have the same parentage. And the emotions have the same impact. They keep you from your Father.\nPride says, “You’re too good for him.”\nShame says, “You’re too bad for him.”\nPride drives you away.\nShame keeps you away.\nIf pride is what goes before a fall, then shame is what keeps you from getting up after one.
