But the best invitations of all don’t come from friends.\nThey come from God.\nYou see, our God is an inviting God. He invited Mary to birth His Son, the disciples to fish for men, the woman caught in sin to start over, and Thomas to touch His wounds. God is the King who prepares the palace, sets the table, and invites His people to come in.\nIn fact, it seems His favorite word is come.\n“Come, we will talk these things over. Your sins are red like deep red cloth. But they can be as white as snow” (Isaiah 1:18).\n“All you who are thirsty, come  and drink” (Isaiah 55:1).\n“Come  to me, all of you who are tired and have heavy loads. I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28). ',
