    "body": 'Do you know anyone who goes around saying, “I am”? Neither do I.\nWhen we say “I am,” we always add another word. “I am happy.” “I am sad.” “I am strong.” “I am Max.” God, however, starkly states, “I AM” and adds nothing else.\n“You are what?” we want to ask. “I AM,” he replies. God needs no descriptive word because he never changes. God is what he is. He is what he has always been. His immutability motivated the psalmist to declare,\n“But thou art the same” (Ps. 102:27 KJV). The writer is saying, “You are the One who is. You never change.” Yahweh is an unchanging God. ',
