    "body": 'ne day, in England, a lady wrote to ask if I would come and help her. She said she was blind, having two blood clots be-O hind her eyes. I had been in London recently, and I didn‘t feel I wanted to go. However, I sent a letter, not knowing who she was, saying that if she was willing to go into a room with me and shut the door and never come out until she had perfect sight, I would come. She sent word, "Oh, come!"\n\nThe moment I reached the house, they brought in this blind woman. After we shook hands, she made her way to a room, opened the door, allowed me to go in, and then came in and shut the door. "Now," she said, "we are with God."\n\nHave you ever been there? It is a lovely place.\n\nIn an hour and a half, the power of God fell upon us. Rushing to the window, she exclaimed, "I can see! Oh, I can see! The blood is gone; I can see!" Sitting down in a chair, she asked, "Could I receive the Holy Spirit?"\n\n"Yes," I replied, "if all is right with God."\n\n"You don‘t know me," she continued, "but for ten years I have been fighting your position. I couldn‘t bear these tongues, but God settled it today. I want the baptism of the Holy Spirit."\n\nAfter she had prayed and repented of what she had said about tongues, she was filled with the Holy Spirit and began speaking in tongues.\n\nWhen you put your hands upon people to pray, you can tell when the Holy Spirit is present. And if you will only yield to the Holy Spirit and allow Him to move, my word, what will happen!',
