The old movie house where I took my dates has “For Sale” on the marquee… .\nI wish I could make it all new again. I wish I could blow the dust off the streets … but I can’t.\nI can’t. But God can. “He restores my soul,” wrote the shepherd. He doesn’t reform; he restores. He doesn’t camouflage the old; he restores the new. The Master Builder will pull out the original plan and restore it. He will restore the vigor. He will restore the energy. He will restore the hope.\nHe will restore the soul. ',
