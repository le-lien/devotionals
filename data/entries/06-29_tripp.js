In the beginning scene, we see Adam and Eve quickly clothing themselves and hiding from God in the guilt and shame that is the sad result of their sin (Genesis 3). It is a disaster too horrible to be expressed with the limited words of human language. Blessed with an unimpeded relationship with the Lord, Creator, and King of the universe, blessed with a garden lush with every good thing, they really did have it all. They were made by God and made for him. Their lives were meant to have him at the center. They were hardwired to enjoy eternal fellowship with him. Love for him and worship of him were to be the two principal motivators of all they did. How could this bond be so quickly broken? How could they be afraid of God? How could they try to hide from the One who was the reason for their entire existence? It is too sad to grasp, but the answer to the questions is clear: sin, with its weight of guilt and shame, separated them from God and drove them from the garden of his presence and provision. The bond was broken; how would it ever be repaired?\nThe second scene is the marriage supper of the Lamb (Revelation 19). It too is a gathering of sinners, but they aren’t cowering in shame. They aren’t hiding in guilt. They aren’t dreading his presence. They don’t fear the power of his anger. No, these sinners are celebrating because the bond that was broken in the garden has been restored. They have been wed to their Savior forever. Forever they will be in his presence. Never again will they be separate from him. Never again will they hide. Never again will they be driven away. Their fellowship will never end. The sound of their celebration will never grow quiet. Their robes have been washed to purest white. They are clothed in the righteousness of another. They are accepted because of him. There is no condemnation before them. There is no sin that separates them. It is a scene of such outrageous beauty that describing it would stretch human language beyond its limits.\nWhat made the difference between these two scenes? Not human wisdom,\nstrength, position, or righteousness. The difference is captured in one gloriously transformational word. Other than the name of Jesus, it may be the most important word in all the Bible: grace. Grace in the person and work—the life, death, and resurrection—of Jesus is what made the difference. If you’re God’s child, stop hiding behind the trees of your shame. Step out into the light. There’s a celebration in your future!',
