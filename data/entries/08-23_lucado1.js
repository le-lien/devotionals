Not on the upswing.  God doesn’t improve; he perfects. He doesn’t enhance; he completes… .\nNow I realize that there’s a sense in which we’re imperfect. We still err.\nWe still stumble. We still do exactly what we don’t want to do. And that part of us is, according to the verse, “being made holy.”\nBut when it comes to our position before God, we’re perfect. When he sees each of us, he sees one who has been made perfect through the One who is perfect—Jesus Christ. ',
