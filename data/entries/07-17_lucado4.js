    "body": 'When I was seven years old, I ran away from home. I’d had enough of my father’s rules. With my clothes in a paper bag, I stormed out the back gate and marched down the alley. But I didn’t go far. I got to the end of the alley and realized I was hungry, so I went back home.\nAlthough my disobedience was brief, it was still disobedience. And if you had stopped me in that alley, I just might have told you how I felt: “I don’t need a father. I’m too big for his rules.”\nI didn’t hear the rooster crow like Peter did. Or the fish belch like Jonah did. I didn’t get a robe like the prodigal son did. But I learned from my earthly father what they learned from their heavenly Father: I can count on God to be on my side no matter what I do. You can too.\nGrowing in Grace ',
