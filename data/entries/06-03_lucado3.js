But they can’t dominate you. You know how to deal with them. You face giants by facing God first.\nPaul, the apostle, wrote, “Prayer is essential in this ongoing warfare. Pray hard and long” (Ephesians 6:18 MSG). Prayer spawned David’s successes.\nHow do you survive a fugitive life in the caves? David did with prayers like this one: “Be good to me, God—and now! I’ve run to you for dear life. I’m hiding out under your wings until the hurricane blows over. I call out to High God, the God who holds me together” (Psalm 57:1–2 MSG).\nMark well this promise: “[God] will keep in perfect peace all who trust in\n[God], all whose thoughts are fixed on [God]!” (Isaiah 26:3 NLT). God promises not just peace, but perfect peace. To whom? To those whose minds are “fixed” on God. Forget an occasional text. Peace is promised to the one who fixes thoughts and desires on the King.\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
