He is the perfect one to do so.\nHe has the right vision. He reminds you that “you are like foreigners and strangers in this world.” And he urges you to lift your eyes from the jungle around you to the heaven above you.\nHe also has the right direction. He made the boldest claim in the history of man when he declared, “I am the way” (John 14:6). People wondered if the claim was accurate. He answered their questions by cutting a path through the underbrush of sin and death . . . and escaping alive. He’s the only One who ever did. And he is the only One who can help you and me do the same. ',
