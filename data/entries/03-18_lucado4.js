God is using today’s troubles to make you stronger for tomorrow. He is training  you. The same God who is making you grow taller will help your spirit grow stronger.\nRemember that God lives inside you. Think about His power that gives you life. As you think about God living in you, you may change the places you want to go and the things you want to do today. ',
