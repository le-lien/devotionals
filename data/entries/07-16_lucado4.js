No. His gift is for us all\n—rich and poor, popular and unpopular, sports stars and science geeks. All God’s children.\nAnd God wants each of us so badly that He’ll take us no matter what shape we’re in. He wants us “as is”—just as we are—with all our mistakes, all our worries and fears, and all our imperfections. ',

Remember, Jesus died for us while  we were still sinners. His sacrifice—and our salvation—does not depend on what we do. It depends on who God is.',

The leftover part in the school play, the leftover pizza with all the pepperoni gone. But God’s gifts—love, mercy, and understanding—are the same for all His children. No one gets leftovers.'
