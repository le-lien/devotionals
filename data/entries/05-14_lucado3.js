I promised I wouldn’t, but I did. I was quiet when I should have been bold. I took a seat when I should have taken a stand. If this were the first time, it would be different. But it isn’t. How many times can one fall and expect to be caught?\nYour eyes look in the mirror and see the same. A failure. A promise-breaker. But when you look through the eyes of faith, everything changes.\nYou look in the mirror and see a robed rebel bearing the ring of grace on your finger and the kiss of your Father on your face.\nYour eyes see your faults. Your faith sees your Savior. Your eyes see your guilt. Your faith sees his sacrifice for you. ',
