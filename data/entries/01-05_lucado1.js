Just when the womb gets too old for babies, Sarai gets pregnant.\nJust when the failure is too great for grace, David is pardoned… .\nThe lesson? Three words. Don’t give up… .\nIs the road long? Don’t stop.\nIs the night black? Don’t quit.\nGod is watching. For all you know right at this moment . . . the check may be in the mail.\nThe apology may be in the making.\nThe job contract may be on the desk.\nDon’t quit. For if you do, you may miss the answer to your prayers. ',
