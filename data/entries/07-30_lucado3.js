    "body": 'Recently, my daughter Jenna and I spent several days in the old city of Jerusalem. One afternoon, as we were exiting a gate, we found ourselves behind an orthodox Jewish family—a father and his three small girls. One of the daughters, just four or five years old, fell a few steps behind and couldn’t see her father. “Abba!” she called to him. He spotted her and immediately took her hand.\nWhen the signal changed, he led her and her sisters through the intersection. In the middle of the street, he reached down and swung her up into his arms as they continued their journey.\nIsn’t that what we all need? An Abba who will hear when we call? Who will take our hand when we are weak? Who will guide us through the hectic intersections of life? Don’t we all need an Abba who will swing us up into his arms and carry us home? We all need a Father. ',

Or was your father too busy or distant to care? No matter. We each have a heavenly Father who takes us into his arms. We can call him Abba.'
