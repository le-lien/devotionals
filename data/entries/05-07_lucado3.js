He was all about including people, not excluding them. “The Word became flesh and blood, and moved into the neighborhood” (John 1:14 MSG). Jesus touched lepers and loved foreigners and spent so much time with partygoers that people called him a\n“lush, a friend of the riffraff” (Matthew 11:19 MSG). Racism couldn’t keep him from the Samaritan woman; demons couldn’t keep him from the demonpossessed. His Facebook friends would have included financial schemers and women of questionable reputations.\nGod calls us to be like Jesus, to change the way we look at people. Not to see them as jocks or geeks, preps or techs, insiders or outsiders. Not to label.\nLet’s view people as we do ourselves. Blemished, perhaps. Unfinished, for certain. In our lifetimes you and I are going to come across people tossed out of the “in” crowd. And we get to choose. Neglect or rescue? Label them or love them? We know Jesus’ choice. Just look at what he did with us. ',
