Will my mom and dad be angry with me if I mess up?</i>\nSome worries can be fixed with a little studying or even a heart-to-heart talk. But what about those worries that are too big for you—like thunderstorms, or sickness, or the terrible things you see on the news? You could spend your whole life worrying!\nHonestly, do you think that’s what God wants? God didn’t send Jesus to save you just so you could worry. Jesus wasn’t nailed to the cross just so He could ignore your prayers. Worrying can’t fix anything, but God can. Trust Him with all those things you worry about. God has even “put his angels in charge of you” to “watch over you wherever you go” (Psalm 91:11).\nWorry? I don’t think so. ',
