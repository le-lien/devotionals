But as soon as the sin is read, grace and forgiveness are given.\nThe result? God’s mercy will be heard throughout the universe. For the first time in history, we will understand how great His goodness is. Not just a one-size-fits-all grace. But personal grace. Just for you. Specific kindness.\nIndividual forgiveness. We will stand in awe as one sin after another is read and then forgiven.\nThe devil will hide. The angels will sing. And we will stand tall in God’s grace. As we see how much He has forgiven us, we will see how much He loves us. And we will worship Him. ',
