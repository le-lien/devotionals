As long as you are feeling happy, you don’t need comfort. As long as you would rather follow your friends Monday through Saturday and follow Jesus only on Sunday, you’re not really following Him at all. Because He wants all of you every day, not just a little bit on Sunday. ',

When you are ready to give Him all your worries and cares, He will be there. When your problems flash around you like lightning in a storm, Jesus will be right there in the middle of the storm—waiting to save you.',
      "text": 'Growing in Grace Some substitutes are okay—like margarine for butter. But others aren’t. Try this: stir up a package of powdered drink mix, but use flour instead of sugar. Did it work? No! Faith is the same way. Some people put their faith in money, friends, or fame, but there’s no substitute for Jesus!'
