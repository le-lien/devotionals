We don’t do what we want to do, we don’t like what we do, and what’s worse—yes, there is something worse—we can’t change.\nWe try, oh, how we try. But “Can a leopard change his spots? In the same way, Jerusalem, you cannot change and do good, because you are accustomed to doing evil” (Jer. 13:23).\nWe, like Adam, were under a curse, but Jesus “changed places with us and put himself under that curse” (Gal. 3:13).\nThe sinless One took on the face of a sinner so that we sinners could take on the face of a saint.
