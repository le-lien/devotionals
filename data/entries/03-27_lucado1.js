Paul tells us that a man who won’t feed his own family is worse than an unbeliever (1 Tim. 5:8).\nHow much more will a holy God care for his children? After all, how can we fulfill his mission unless our needs are met? How can we teach or minister or influence unless we have our basic needs satisfied? Will God enlist us in his army and not provide a commissary? Of course not.\n“I pray that the God of peace will give you everything you need so you can do what he wants” (Heb. 13:20). Hasn’t that prayer been answered in our life? We may not have had a feast, but haven’t we always had food?\nPerhaps there was no banquet, but at least there was bread. And many times there was  a banquet. ',
