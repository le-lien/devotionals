    "body": 'When I was young, the minute we neighborhood kids got home from school we’d drop the books and hit the pavement. The kid across the street had a dad with a strong addiction to football. As soon as he was home from work we’d start yelling for him to come and play. Out of fairness he’d always ask, “Which team is losing?” Then he would join that team, which often seemed to be mine.\nHis appearance in the huddle changed the whole ballgame. He was confident, strong, and most of all, he had a plan. We’d circle around him, and he’d say, “Okay, boys, here is what we’re going to do.” The other side was groaning before we left the huddle. You see, we not only had a new plan, we had a new leader.\nHe brought new life to our team. God does precisely the same for us. We didn’t need a new play; we needed a new plan. We didn’t need to trade positions; we needed a new player. That player is Jesus Christ, God’s firstborn Son. ',

      "text": 'Do you ever feel that way—that you’re on a losing team with little hope for a comeback? That no matter how hard you try to move the ball, you end up losing yardage? There is One with a playbook designed specifically for your situation. One God. One plan. One life. Trust him with yours.'
