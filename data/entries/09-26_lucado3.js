    "body": 'Some time ago my daughter Andrea got a splinter in her finger. I took her to the restroom and set out tweezers, ointment, and a Band-Aid. She didn’t like what she saw. “I just want the Band-Aid, Daddy.”\nSometimes we are just like Andrea. Maybe we’ve lied to a friend, stayed out past a curfew, or smoked something we shouldn’t have. We come to Christ with our mistake, but all we want is a covering. We want to skip the treatment. We want to hide our sin. And one wonders if God, even in his great mercy, will heal what we conceal.\nHow can God heal what we deny? How can God touch what we cover up? A Band-Aid does no good if the splinter is still there underneath. Don’t deny. Confess everything to him. Give God the chance to remove the splinters of sin in your life. It’s the only way to be truly healed. ',
