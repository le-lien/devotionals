You’ve never won much.\nYou’ve watched the Mark McGwires of this world carry home the trophies and walk away with the ribbons. All you have are “almosts” and “what ifs.”\nIf that hits home, then you’ll cherish this promise: “And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away” (1 Pet. 5:4 NIV).\nYour day is coming. What the world has overlooked, your Father has remembered, and sooner than you can imagine, you will be blessed by him. ',
