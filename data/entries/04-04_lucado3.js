You need hope, but the needle is in the red. You want five gallons of solutions but can only muster a few drops.\nMy first thought when I run out of fuel is, How can I get this car to a gas pump?  Your first thought when you have a problem should be, How can I get this problem to Jesus?\nLet’s get practical. You and a good friend are about to battle it out again.\nThe thunderstorm looms on the horizon. Both of you need patience, but both tanks are empty. What if one of you calls, “Time-out”? What if one of you says, “Let’s talk to Jesus before we talk to each other. In fact, let’s talk to Jesus until we can talk to each other”?\nCouldn’t hurt. After all, he broke down the walls of Jericho. Perhaps he could do the same for yours. ',
