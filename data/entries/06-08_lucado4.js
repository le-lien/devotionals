Did you see him? He ‘ate locusts and wild honey’ (Mark 1:6)! I’m not sitting next to him in Sunday school!”\nJohn’s message was as no-nonsense as his dress: confess your sins and turn away from them because the Lord is on His way (Matthew 3:2). John the Baptist set himself apart from the rest for one reason—to tell others about Jesus. Everything about John focused on that one task. His dress. His food. His words. His actions.\nYou don’t have to be like the world to make a difference in the world.\nYou don’t have to be like the crowd to change the crowd. You don’t have to lower yourself down to their level to lift them up to God’s level. ',
