    "body": 'Some people might think, <i>Jesus, it’s easy for You up there. You’re in heaven. You just don’t know how hard it is down here. </i>But those people would be wrong. The Bible says He “is able to understand” (Hebrews 4:15).\nJesus knows. He knows because He <i>Himself</i> left heaven and came to earth. He didn’t send an angel or a messenger. And He didn’t come as God.\nHe made Himself completely human.\nDo you ever feel angry, scared, or left out? Jesus did. Did you know that Jesus was once your age? He had parents to obey and brothers and sisters to get along with. He fell down, and He fell asleep. He went to school and played with friends. He was laughed at, and He was hurt.\nJesus knows everything you’re going through. It’s one of the reasons He came to earth—so He would know what it feels like. And so He could help you get through it. ',
