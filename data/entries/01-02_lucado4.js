    "body": 'Do you ever feel invisible? As if nobody even notices you? <i>Maybe some new clothes will get me noticed,</i> you think. And maybe they do.\nFor a little while. But then the latest craze is yesterday’s news, and you’re back to ... invisible. Want a change that lasts? Learn to see yourself as God sees you—covered with the “clothes of salvation” and wrapped in “a coat of goodness” (Isaiah 61:10).\nDo you ever feel like a nobody? When you do, remember what you are really worth. Remember what—or rather who—God gave to save you:\n“You were bought with the precious blood of the death of Christ, who was like a pure and perfect lamb” (1 Peter 1:19).\nIf you ever start to feel invisible or left out, remember this: God <i>chooses</i> you to be His child. That can be hard to remember sometimes. So pray about it. Think about it. Let the way God sees you change the way you see yourself. ',
