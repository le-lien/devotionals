Doubt is part of the journey to rock-solid conviction. If you’re unsure what you believe, it doesn’t mean you’re a “bad Christian” or that you’re doomed. It’s okay to ask the hard questions. God can handle it. So how can people get to that place of firm faith? The path varies, but here are a few ideas.\nSpace: Billions of galaxies and expanding. Where does it end? How did it all begin? Earth: So much variety and beauty. How did it come to be? Why does it work in such harmony? Ethics: Throughout history, murder is always bad, courage always good. Who programmed us? Bible: Examine the wisdom.\nExperience the stories. Empty tomb: So many who claimed to see the risen Lord died with those words on their lips. Would they die for a lie? Jesus: No other man in history caused so many questions, stirred so many hearts, gave so many answers. Could he be who he said he was?\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
