    "body": 'Jesus chose to come to earth in a human body … just like yours.\nThe mouth that called Lazarus out of the grave was human … just like your mouth. The hand that touched the leper had dirt under its nails.\nThe feet that the woman washed with her tears were dusty. And His tears—\nyes, He had tears too—they came from a heart that was as broken as yours or mine has ever been.\nBecause Jesus was so human, people came to Him. My, how they came to Him. They came at night as Nicodemus did. They touched Him as He walked down the street. They followed Him around the sea. They invited Him into their homes and sat their children at His feet. Why? Because He refused to be an “I’m-better-than-you” superstar on a stage. Instead, He chose to be a real person who could be touched and known by people …\njust like you. ',
