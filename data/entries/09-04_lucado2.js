He wrote the book on making the impossible possible.\nExamples? Check the Book.\nEighty-year-old shepherds don’t usually play chicken with Pharaohs …\nbut don’t tell that to Moses.\nTeenage shepherds don’t normally have showdowns with giants … but don’t tell that to David.\nNight-shift shepherds don’t usually get to hear angels sing and see God in a stable … but don’t tell that to the Bethlehem bunch.\nAnd for sure don’t tell that to God. He’s made an eternity out of making the earthbound airborne. And he gets angry when people’s wings are clipped. ',
