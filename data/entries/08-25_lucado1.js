    "body": 'When you recognize God as Creator, you will admire him. When you recognize his wisdom, you will learn from him. When you discover his strength, you will rely on him. But only when he saves you will you worship him.\nIt’s a “before and after” scenario. Before your rescue, you could easily keep God at a distance… . Sure he was important, but so was your career.\nYour status. Your salary… .\nThen came the storm … the rage … the fight … the ripped moorings…\n. Despair fell like a fog; your bearings were gone. In your heart, you knew there was no exit.\nTurn to your career for help? Only if you want to hide from the storm …\nnot escape it. Lean on your status for strength? A storm isn’t impressed with your title… .\nSuddenly you are left with one option: God. ',
