    "body": 'man may be saved and still be carnally minded. When many people hear about the baptism of the Holy Spirit, A their carnal minds at once arise against the Holy Spirit. One time, Jesus‘ disciples wanted to call down fire from heaven as a punishment against a Samaritan village for not welcoming Him. But Jesus said to them, “You do not know what manner of spirit you are of”  (Luke 9:55).\n\nFor we who are in this tent groan, being burdened, not because we want to be unclothed, but further clothed, that mortality may be swallowed up by life. Now He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who also has given us the Spirit as a guarantee. (2 Cor. 5:4–5) God must have people for Himself who are being clothed with a heavenly habitation, perfectly prepared by the Holy Spirit for the Day of the Lord. “For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven”  (v. 2).\n\nWas Paul speaking here only about the coming of the Lord? No. Yet this condition of preparedness on earth is related to our heavenly state. The Holy Spirit is coming to take out of the world a church that is a perfect bride. He must find in us perfect yieldedness, with every desire subjected to Him. He has come to reveal Christ in us so that the glorious flow of the life of God may flow out of us, bringing rivers of living water to the thirsty land.\n\n“If Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness”  (Rom. 8:10).',
