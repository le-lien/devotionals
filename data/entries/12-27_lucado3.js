    "body": 'Joseph had to make the biggest decision of his life. Mary was pregnant, but the baby was not his. His first thought was to quietly release Mary from their engagement and save her from public judgment and stoning. But then an angel in a dream told him not to be afraid to take Mary as his wife.\nJoseph made his choice. He tanked his reputation for a pregnant fiancée and an illegitimate son. He placed God’s plan ahead of his own. Rather than make a name for himself, Joseph made a home for Christ. And because he did, a great reward came his way. “He called His name JESUS” (Matthew 1:25).\nBy now, millions have spoken the name of Jesus. Look at the person selected to stand at the front of the line. Joseph. Of all the saints, sinners, prodigals, and preachers who have spoken the name, Joseph, a blue-collar, small-town construction worker said it first. He cradled the wrinkle-faced prince of heaven and with an audience of angels and pigs, whispered, “Jesus ... You’ll be called Jesus.” ',
