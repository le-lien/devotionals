    "body": 'Life at camp is a lot different from life at home. The first day or two, it’s great. Nobody cares if you leave your socks on the floor or take a shower or brush your teeth. You can be a total slob, and no one cares.\nAbout the middle of the week, things start to change. You get tired of stepping over your dirty clothes and everyone else’s. You really wish you had a clean bed. And that smell you’ve been smelling—it’s you! By the end of the week, you can’t take it anymore. Out come the soap and toothpaste, and up go the socks and towels.\nWhat happened? Simple. You knew there was a better way.\nIsn’t that what Jesus does for us? Before we knew Jesus, our lives were sloppy and selfish. But suddenly now we want to do good—even when no one is looking! Go back to the old mess? Are you kidding? Not a chance. ',
