And even today, after billions have chosen to prostitute themselves before the pimps of power, fame, and wealth, he still waits for them.\nIt is inexplicable. It doesn’t have a drop of logic nor a thread of rationality.\nAnd yet, it is that very irrationality that gives the gospel its greatest defense. For only God could love like that… .\nHow absurd to think that such nobility would go to such poverty to share such a treasure with such thankless souls.\nBut he did. ',
