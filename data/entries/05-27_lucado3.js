Revenge needs a place to stay, so we have him pull up a chair. Pity wants to have a party, so we show him the kitchen. Lust rings the bell, and we set up the guest room. Don’t we know how to say no?\nMany don’t. For most of us, thought management is, well, unthought of.\nWe think much about time management, weight management, course-load management, skin management. But what about thought management?\nShouldn’t we be as concerned about managing our thoughts as we are managing anything else?\nThe Bible says, “Keep your minds on whatever is true, pure, right, holy, friendly, and proper. Don’t ever stop thinking about what is truly worthwhile and worthy of praise” (Philippians 4:8 CEV). Another way to say it? Don’t let in the trash. ',

Every kind of garbage is knocking on the door of your mind, trying to get in and make itself at home. Keep the door locked by thinking about what is true and pure and giving God the key.'
