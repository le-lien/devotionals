They need a shepherd to lead them to “calm water” (Psalm 23:2).\nSheep cannot protect themselves. They have no claws, no horns, no fangs. They are helpless. Sheep need a shepherd with a “rod and walking stick” to protect them (Psalm 23:4). Sheep have no sense of direction. They need someone to lead them “on paths that are right” (Psalm 23:3).\nWe need a shepherd too. Because we, too, have a habit of getting stuck in troubles we should have avoided. Because we cannot defend ourselves against the evil lion—the devil—who prowls around seeking some lost soul to devour. And because we sometimes lose our way in life. We need a Shepherd to care for us, to protect us, and to guide us. And we have one Jesus! He knows each of His sheep by name. He knows your  name.',
