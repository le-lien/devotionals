    "body": 'The summer before my eighth-grade year I made friends with a guy named Larry. He was new to town, so I encouraged him to go out for our school football team. The result was a good news–bad news scenario. The good news? He made the cut. The bad news? He won my position. I tried to be happy for him, but it was tough.\nA few weeks into the season Larry fell off a motorcycle and broke a finger. I remember the day he stood at my front door holding up his bandaged hand. “Looks like you’re going to have to play.” I tried to feel sorry for him, but it was hard. The Bible passage was a lot easier for Paul to write than it was for me to practice. “Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep” (Romans 12:15 NASB).\nYou want to find out if your love for someone is real? See how you feel when that person succeeds. God will rejoice. I hope you will too. ',
