    "body": 'When you place your trust in Christ, he places his Spirit in you. And when the Spirit comes, he brings gifts, housewarming gifts of sorts. “A spiritual gift is given to each of us as a means of helping the entire church” (1 Cor. 12:7 NLT). Remember, God prepacked you with strengths. When you become a child of God, the Holy Spirit requisitions your abilities for the expansion of God’s kingdom, and they become spiritual gifts. The Holy Spirit may add other gifts according to his plan. But no one is gift deprived.\nLonely? God is with you.\nDepleted? He funds the overdrawn.\nWeary of an ordinary existence? Your spiritual adventure awaits.\nThe cure for the common life begins and ends with God. ',
