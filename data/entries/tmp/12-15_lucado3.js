    "body": 'Computerized Christianity. Push the right buttons, enter the right code, insert the correct data, and bingo, print out your own salvation.\nYou do your part and the Divine Computer does his. No need to pray (after all, you control the keyboard). No emotional attachment necessary (who wants to hug circuits?). And worship? Well, worship is a lab exercise—insert the rituals and see the results.\nReligion by computer. That’s what happens when you replace the living God with a cold system. When you replace inestimable love with a by-the-numbers budget. When you replace the ultimate sacrifice of Christ with the puny achievements of man.\nAnd what about the personal, you ask? What about relationship with a rescuer? What about joining God’s family? “I will walk among you and be your God, and you will be my people” (Leviticus 26:12 NIV). That’s something else entirely. That’s real faith.\n',

      "text": 'Faith in God is about so much more than applying logic and following rules. It’s not an abstract concept that’s just for study. It’s connecting with Christ on an intimate, personal level. It’s emotional and spiritual as well as intellectual. It’s alive. It’s love.'
