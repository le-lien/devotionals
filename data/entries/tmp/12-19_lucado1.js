Behind a high altar in the church is a cave, a little cavern lit by silver lamps.\nYou can enter the main edifice and admire the ancient church. You can also enter the quiet cave where a star embedded in the floor recognizes the birth of the King. There is one stipulation, however. You have to stoop. The door is so low you can’t go in standing up.\nThe same is true of the Christ. You can see the world standing tall, but to witness the Savior, you have to get [down] on your knees.',
