    "body": 'I know we shouldn’t complain. But, honestly, when someone hands you Christmas candy from two years ago and says, “This is for you,” don’t you detect a lack of creativity? But when a person gives a genuine gift, don’t you cherish the presence of affection? The homebaked cookies, the tickets to see your favorite obscure band, the personalized poem, the Lucado book. Such gifts convince you that someone planned, prepared, saved, searched. Last-minute decision? No, this gift was just for you.\nHave you ever received such a gift? Yes, you have. Sorry to speak on your behalf, but I know the answer as I ask the question. You have been given a perfect personal gift. One just <i>for you</i>. “There has been born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord” (Luke 2:11 NASB).\nAn angel spoke these words. Shepherds heard them first. But what the angel said to them, God says to anyone who will listen. “There has been born <i>for you</i>...” Jesus is the gift. ',
