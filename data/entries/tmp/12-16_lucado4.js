Line after line declares the reason we celebrate a birth that happened more than two thousand years ago.\n<i>Jesus became like us, so we could become like Him.\nAngels still sing, and the star still calls to us.\nHe loves each one of us like there is only one of us to love.</i>\nChristmas cards are cheerful little reminders that say, “For God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son... so that whoever believes in him may not be lost, but have eternal life” (John 3:16).
