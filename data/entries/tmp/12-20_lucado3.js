When we say “I am,” we always add another word. “I am <i>happy</i>.” “I am <i>sad</i>.” “I am <i>strong</i>.” “I am <i>Max</i>.” God, however, starkly states, “I AM” and adds nothing else.\n“You are what?” we want to ask. “I AM,” he replies. God needs no descriptive word because he never changes. God is what he is. He is what he has always been. His unalterable nature motivated the psalmist to declare, “But thou art the same” (Psalm 102:27 KJV). The writer is saying, “You are the One who is. You never change.”\nThere’s so much you have to adjust to in life. It seems that everything changes. New classes each term. New friends when old ones ignore you. New feelings as your body develops. New rules as you grow older. Isn’t it good to know you can count on something permanent? Yahweh is an unchanging God. ',
