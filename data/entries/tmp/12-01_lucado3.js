God will speak to you differently than he will speak to others. Just because God spoke to Moses through a burning bush, that doesn’t mean we should all sit next to a bush waiting for God to speak. God used a fish to convict Jonah. Does that mean we should have worship services at Sea World? No. God reveals his heart personally to each person.\nFor that reason, regular time with God is essential. We won’t understand his desires for us after an occasional chat or weekly visit. We learn his will as we walk and talk with him throughout every single day. At breakfast. On the bus. In class. At basketball practice. Before playing that video game. At bedtime.\nWalk with him long enough and you come to know his heart.',
