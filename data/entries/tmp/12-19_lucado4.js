If you visit the city, you can actually visit a small church there that marks the spot where some people believe Jesus was born. In the church is a high altar, and behind the altar is a cave, a little cavern lit by silver lamps.\nYou can go into the main building and admire the ancient church. You can also go into the quiet cave where a star set into the floor recognizes the birth of the King. There is just one thing, however. You have to stoop. The door is so low you can’t go in standing up.\nThe same is true of Jesus. You can stand up tall to see the world, but to really see the Savior, you have to get down on your knees in prayer.',

      "text": 'Today when you pray, try praying on your knees. It will change the way you look at everything. Praying on your knees helps your heart to be humble. From your knees you can see how big God’s creation is and big God must be. And from your knees, you can see how great God is that He would stoop down to listen to your prayers.'
