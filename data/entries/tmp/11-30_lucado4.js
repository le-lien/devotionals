How can He forgive us when we keep messing up again and again?\nFor thousands of years, people have thought about and wondered about the love of our Father. How could Jesus love us enough to step down from the power and glory of heaven and be born as a baby to poor parents huddled in a stable? How could God love us enough to send His Son to die on the cross to save us?\nHow can you explain such love? What can you say to that kind of love? \nThe only thing you can say is, “Lord, thank You, and I love You too.”',
