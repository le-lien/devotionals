Someone you could go camping with or bowling with or count the stars with...\nNow what do you do with a friend? (Well, that’s rather simple too.) You stick by him.\nMaybe that is why John is the only one of the twelve who was at the cross. He came to say good-bye. By his own admission he hadn’t quite put the pieces together yet. But that didn’t really matter. As far as he was concerned, his closest friend was in trouble and he came to help.\n“Can you take care of my mother?” \nOf course. That’s what friends are for.',
