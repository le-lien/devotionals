If our greatest need had been technology, God would have sent us a scientist. If our greatest need had been money, God would have sent us an economist. But since our greatest need was forgiveness, God sent us a Savior.\nChristmas cards. Punctuated promises. Phrases filled with the reason we do it all anyway.\n<i>He became like us, so we could become like him.\nAngels still sing and the star still beckons.\nHe loves each one of us like there was only one of us to love.</i>',
