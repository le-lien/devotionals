Suppose he had heeded the crowd and set up camp in Capernaum, reasoning, “I thought the whole world was my target and the cross my destiny. But the entire town tells me to stay in Capernaum.\Could all these people be wrong?”Yes they could! In defiance of the crowd, Jesus … said no to good things so he could say yes to the right thing: his unique call.',
