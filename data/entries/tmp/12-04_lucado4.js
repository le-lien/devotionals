        "body": 'Sin does to a soul what scissors do to a flower. A cut stem separates a flower from its source of life. At first, the flower is pretty, still colorful and strong. But when you watch that flower over several days, the leaves start to wilt and the petals fall off. No matter what you do, the flower will never live again. Put it in water. Poke the stem in dirt. Cover it with plant food. Do whatever you want, but the flower is dead.\nImagine that your soul is like that flower. When you sin, it’s like slowly cutting your soul off from God, and your soul starts to wither and die. The result of sin is not a bad day or a bad mood, but a dead soul. The signs are easy to spot—lying lips and cursing mouths, feet that run to do evil and eyes that don’t see God.\nBut unlike the flower, the soul can be healed—through Jesus. And all you have to do is ask. ',

Its needles begin to fall off, and soon it’s all brown and brittle—just like us when we’re cut off from God.'
