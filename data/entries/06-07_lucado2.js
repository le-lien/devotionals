    "body": 'Would you do what Jesus did? He swapped a spotless castle for a grimy stable. He exchanged the worship of angels for the company of killers. He could hold the universe in his palm but gave it up to float in the womb of a maiden.\nIf you were God, would you sleep on straw, nurse from a breast, and be clothed in a diaper? I wouldn’t, but Christ did.\nIf you knew that only a few would care that you came, would you still come? If you knew that those you loved would laugh in your face, would you still care? … Christ did.\nHe humbled himself. He went from commanding angels to sleeping in the straw. From holding stars to clutching Mary’s finger. The palm that held the universe took the nail of a soldier.\nWhy? Because that’s what love does. It puts the beloved before itself. ',
