    "body": 'In Revelation 12:7–9, we see that heaven has been purged of the dragon (Satan) and his angels. Rejoice, heaven; look out, earth! Now the devil is right down here on earth, and he knows he has only a few short years to do mischief and cause harm. It is clear to me that this period is closely related to all (or part) of the seventieth week of Daniel. (See Daniel 9:21–24.) It is a specific time period—one that the devil, who is a student of prophecy, knows well. And Jesus has said those days will be cut short. (See, for example, Matthew 24:21–22.) Though theoretically the Bible says three and a half years, there will be at least a few “days”\ntaken off at the end. Then, the devil will be bound and imprisoned in the bottomless pit.\nThe devil wants to keep us ignorant of this fact, because as long we are ignorant, we cannot do what God has appointed. But God has given us the spiritual weapons to cast down Satan from his place in the heavenlies.\nFor the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but are mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, casting down arguments\n[“imaginations” kjv]  and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God.\n(2 Corinthians 10:4–5) ',

The last, ultimate, supreme high thing that opposes God is Satan’s kingdom in the heavenlies. To us are committed the weapons that will enable us to defeat it: the blood of Jesus and the word of our testimony.'
