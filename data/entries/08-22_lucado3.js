    "body": 'Some years ago a sociologist joined a group of mountain climbers on an expedition. He noticed a connection between cloud cover and contentment.\nWhen there were no clouds and the peak was in view, the climbers were energetic and cooperative. When the gray clouds blocked the view of the mountaintop, though, the climbers were sullen and selfish.\nThe same thing happens to us. As long as our eyes are on God’s majesty, there is a bounce in our step. But let our eyes focus on the dirt beneath us and we will grumble about every rock and crevice we have to cross. For this reason Paul urged, “Don’t shuffle along, eyes to the ground, absorbed with the things right in front of you. Look up, and be alert to what is going on around Christ—that’s where the action is. See things from his perspective”\n(Colossians 3:1–2 MSG).\nYou’re on your way up. You’ll enjoy the climb far more if you keep your eyes on Jesus. ',
