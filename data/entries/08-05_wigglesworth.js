    "body": 'The Holy Spirit fell upon a young man outside a church. He went into the church, where they were all very sedate. If T anything were to move in that church out of the ordinary, it would have been extraordinary! This young man, with his fullness of life and zeal for the Master, started shouting and praising the Lord, manifesting the joy of the Lord; he disturbed the old saints.\n\nIn this church, an old man was reading the Psalms quietly one day. It touched the young Spirit-filled man who was sitting behind him. And the young man shouted, "Glory!" Said the old man, "Do you call that religion?"\n\nThe father of the young man was one of the deacons of the church. The other deacons gathered around him and said, "You must talk to your boy and make him understand that he has to wait until he is established before he manifests those things." So the father had a long talk with the boy and told him what the deacons had said. "You know," he said, "I must respect the deacons, and they have told me they won‘t put up with your enthusiasm. You have to wait until you are established."\n\nAs they neared their home, their horse made a sudden and complete stop. The father tried to make it go forward or backward, but the horse would not move for anything.\n\n"What is up with the horse?" asked the father of the boy. "Father," replied the boy, "this horse has gotten established."\n\nI pray that we will not get established in that way. God, loose us from these critical, long-faced, poisoned countenances, which haven‘t seen daylight for many days. Deliver us from acting in such a terrible way. We must have the reality of supernatural quickening until we are sane and active and not in any way dormant, but filled with life, God working in us mightily by His Spirit.',
