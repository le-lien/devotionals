    "body": 'As a young boy, I read a Russian fable about a master and a servant who went on a journey to a city. Many of the details I’ve forgotten but the ending I remember. Before the two men could reach the destination they were caught in a blinding blizzard. They lost their direction and were unable to reach the city before nightfall.\nThe next morning concerned friends went searching for the two men.\nThey finally found the master, frozen to death, face down in the snow.\nWhen they lifted him they found the servant— cold but alive. He survived and told how the master had voluntarily placed himself on top of the servant so the servant could live.\nI hadn’t thought of that story in years. But when I read what Christ said he would do for us, the story surfaced—for Jesus is the master who died for the servants. ',
