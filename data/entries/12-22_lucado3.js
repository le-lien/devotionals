    "body": 'Go with me back in history a couple of thousand years. Let’s go to Rome, to a rather drab little room. Inside we see a man seated on the floor. He’s an older fellow, shoulders stooped and balding. Chains are on his hands and feet. It is the apostle Paul. The apostle who was bound only by the will of God is now in chains—stuck in a dingy house—attached to a Roman officer.\nPaul the prisoner has a message to communicate. No e-mail here, however. No Facebook either. So Paul writes a letter. No doubt it is a complaint letter to God. No doubt it is a list of grievances. He has every reason to be bitter and complain. But he doesn’t. Instead, he writes a letter that two thousand years later is still known as the treatise on joy—Philippians.\nHow can a man in chains write about being “full of joy in the Lord” (Philippians 4:4 NLT)? The answer for him—and for you—is in Jesus, who brings joy to the world.',
