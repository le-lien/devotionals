    "body": 'This is the fourth “Let us” statement in Hebrews. I believe the fourth step is directly related to the first three steps, and that the sequence is significant. In order to be able to draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, we need to make sure that we have taken the first three steps.The first step is to fear: “Let us fear”  (Hebrews 4:1). Fearing means that we come with an attitude of reverence and an awareness of our need of God’s grace. Second, “Let us…be diligent” (Hebrews 4:11).\nThis is our response to God’s grace: we are not slack, lazy, indifferent, or presumptuous. God’s grace does not justify our indifference or presumption; rather, it provokes us to be diligent. The third step is:\n“Let us hold fast our confession” (Hebrews 4:14). We must have the right confession; we have to say with our mouths the truth about Jesus and what He has done for us.\nIn regard to our approaching the throne of grace, we are told to come for two things: mercy and grace. My conviction is that if God invites us to come, and if we meet the conditions I have outlined, then mercy and grace await us. We never need to be afraid; we will never be disappointed. God would never give an invitation that He would not stand behind and fulfill. If we come as God’s children, we do not come as beggars. God has no second-class children. He never holds us at a distance if we have met the conditions for approach. It is very important that we come with confidence. That is faith in action. It is faith that will not be denied. It is faith that takes God at His Word and believes that God is as good as His Word. It is faith in God’s faithfulness. That is how we are to approach the throne—with confidence. ',
