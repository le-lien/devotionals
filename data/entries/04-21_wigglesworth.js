    "body": 'The glory on the face of Moses had to pass away. Why was it to be done away with? So that something else that had ex-T ceeding glory could take its place.\n\nWe have no conception of the depths and heights of the liberty and blessing of the “ministry of the Spirit.”  We must reach for this position of godliness and be partakers of the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4). The law was so glorious that Moses was filled with joy in the expectation of what it would mean. To us, there is the excellence of Christ‘s glory in the ministry of the Holy Spirit. It is no longer, "Thou shalt not." Rather, it is God‘s will, revealed to us in Christ. “I delight to do Your will, O my God”  (Ps. 40:8). And, beloved, in our hearts there is exceeding glory. Oh, the joy of this celestial touch!\n\nWhen Peter was recalling that wonderful day on the Mount of Transfiguration, he said, “Such a voice came to Him from the Excellent Glory”  (2 Pet. 1:17). If I were to come to you right now and say, "Whatever you do, you must try to be holy," I would miss it. I would be altogether outside of God‘s plan. But I take the words of the epistle, which says by the Holy Spirit, “Be holy”  (1 Pet. 1:16). It is as easy as possible to be holy, but you can never be holy by your own efforts. God wants us to be entirely eaten up by this holy zeal for Him, so that every day we will walk in the Spirit. It is lovely to walk in the Spirit, for He will cause you to dwell in safety, to rejoice inwardly, and to praise God reverently.',
