We need someone clean too.\nThat’s why we need a savior.\nTrying to make it to heaven on our own goodness is like trying to get to the moon on a moon beam; nice idea, but try it and see what happens.\nListen. Quit trying to quench your own guilt. You can’t do it. There’s no way. Not with a bottle of whiskey or perfect Sunday school attendance.\nSorry. I don’t care how bad you are. You can’t be bad enough to forget it.\nAnd I don’t care how good you are. You can’t be good enough to overcome it.\nYou need a Savior. ',
