    "body": 'Gideon was hiding when the Lord came to him and told him to lead His people to defeat the mighty forces of the Midianites. That’s like God telling the smallest kid in school to stand up to the biggest bully. Or a grandmother to take on a bank robber. Or to use a flyswatter on a rattlesnake! “Y-y-ou b-b-better get somebody else,” we would say.\nThat’s when God reminds us that He knows we  can’t do it. But He can.\nAnd to prove it, He gives us a wonderful gift—a spirit of peace. It’s a peace that we can’t understand. A peace that helps us do the right thing. God gave it to David after He showed him Goliath. God gave it to Saul after the road to Damascus. And God gave it to Jesus after He showed Him the cross.\nGod also gave it to Gideon. So Gideon gave the name to God. He built an altar and named it Jehovah-shalom, which means “The Lord Is Peace”\n(Judges 6:24).\nGrowing in Grace\nCan you see the wind? Do you understand how it works? No, but you can know it is real by the way it moves the trees. God’s peace is the same way.\nYou can’t see it or understand it, but you can know it is real by the way it moves people. ',
