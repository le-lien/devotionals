It is a genuine, sincere regret that creates sorrow and moves us to admit wrong and desire to do better.\nIt’s an inward conviction that expresses itself in outward actions.\nYou look at the love of God and you can’t believe he’s loved you like he has, and this realization motivates you to change your life. That is the nature of repentance. ',
