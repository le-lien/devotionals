He has delivered us from the power of darkness and conveyed us into the kingdom of the Son of His love.\n(Colossians 1:12–13)\nIt is a fact that God has delivered us from the power of darkness—\nthat is, Satan’s kingdom—and conveyed us into the kingdom of Christ.\nThus, we have redemption—our sins are forgiven. We are no longer in Satan’s territory, nor are we under his authority. The unbelieving, those who reject Christ, the rebellious, and the disobedient are under Satan’s legitimate authority, but we Christians are not.\nThe fact is that when we repented and surrendered to Jesus Christ and made Him Lord of our lives, we were conveyed (translated, or carried over)—spirit, soul, and body—out of the kingdom of Satan and into the kingdom of Christ. These are facts. We believe facts from the invisible realm of God’s Word because we no longer go by our feelings.\nThe shield of faith covers every area of our lives. No fiery dart need ever get past it. (See Ephesians 6:16.) ',
