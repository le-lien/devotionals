Which of us would have dared to say, “God, would you please hang yourself on a tool of torture as a substitution for every mistake I have ever committed?” And then have the nerve to add, “And after you forgive me, could you prepare me an awesome place in heaven to live forever?”\nAnd if that wasn’t enough: “And would you please live within me and protect me and guide me and bless me with more than I could ever deserve?”\nHonestly, would we have the gall to ask for that?\nJesus already knows what we need. He knows the cost of grace. He already knows the price of forgiveness. It’s everything. But he offers it anyway. ',
