    "body": 'The Bible says that we are to glorify God in both our bodies and our spirits (see 1 Corinthians 6:20), for both belong to God; both have been redeemed out of the hand of the devil by the blood of Jesus. No part of me—spirit, soul, or body—is under the dominion or control of Satan.Let me say clearly that I do not have a resurrection body but a mortal body. But that mortal body—all its fibers, cells, and tissues—is God’s property, not the devil’s. If the devil encroaches on that territory, he is a trespasser. By application of our rights in Jesus, we can put up a sign that says “No Trespassing.” Legally, our bodies do not belong to the devil but to Jesus, who has a special purpose for them. They are to be places of personal residence of the third Person of the Godhead, the Holy Spirit. Our bodies are sacred because they are the appointed dwelling places of the Holy Spirit.\nScripture says clearly many times that God does not dwell in temples made with hands. (See, for example, Acts 7:48.) Neither does He dwell in church buildings, chapels, synagogues, or other physical houses of worship. He dwells in His people. ',
