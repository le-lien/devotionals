And, thankfully, God doesn’t ask you to be. That’s what His grace is for—it washes away all those times that you’re not perfect.\nWhen God gives you His grace, He then asks you to do something for Him: remember that no one else is perfect either. Give a little grace to those around you.\nBecause it’s going to happen. Your brother or sister will say something mean. Your best friend will hurt your feelings. Once in a while even your mom or dad might snap at you. When those things happen, don’t hold a grudge. Forgive them, and give a little grace—because God has given you a whole lot. ',
