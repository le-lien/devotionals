Would we be surprised if God came into our meeting or into our preaching in a way we had never looked for Him to come?',

    "body": 'Do not look for God to come in any particular way, but look for Him.  That is the way to make room for Him. Expect Him to come, but do not expect Him only in a certain way. However much we may know God, the great lesson to learn is that at any minute He may break in. We are apt to over look this element of surprise, yet God never works in any other way. All of a sudden God meets the life -\n“When it was the good pleasure of God…”\nKeep your life so constant in its contact with God that His surprising power may break out on the right hand and on the left. Always be in a state of expectancy, and see that you leave room for God to come in as He likes. ',
