    "body": 'It is one of those “put-you-in-your-place responses.” God is speaking to Job and drawing the Creator/creature line of distinction in bold strokes. It is a stunning description of God’s majesty and Job’s smallness. These are words we should read again and again:\nThen the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said:\n“Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?\nDress for action like a man;\nI will question you, and you make it known to me.\n“Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?\nTell me, if you have understanding.\nWho determined its measurements—surely you know!\nOr who stretched the line upon it?\nOn what were its bases sunk,\nor who laid its cornerstone,\nwhen the morning stars sang together\nand all the sons of God shouted for joy?\n“Or who shut in the sea with doors\nwhen it burst out from the womb,\nwhen I made clouds its garment\nand thick darkness its swaddling band, and prescribed limits for it and set bars and doors,\nand said, ‘Thus far shall you come, and no farther, and here shall your proud waves be stayed?’” (Job 38:1–11) Turn to your Bible and continue reading through chapter 40. Let your heart take in the grandeur of God’s wisdom and power. Let your soul rest in jaw-dropping awe of his\nmajesty. Then remember your own smallness and frailty. Let yourself be humbled by how little you know and how few things you are able to do.\nBegin to embrace the utterly laughable irrationality of ever thinking that in any situation, location, or relationship it would ever be possible for you to be smarter than God. Laugh at the delusion of your own grandeur.\nMock the illusion of your own glory. And in humble gratitude for grace that humbles, bow down and worship.\nAfter you have bowed down and worshiped, get up and serve this One of awesome glory. Refuse to question his will. Refuse to let yourself think that his boundaries are ill placed. Be thankful his majesty is your protection, his glory is your motivation, his grace is your help, and his wisdom is your direction. He is infinitely smarter than you and me in our most brilliant moments.',
