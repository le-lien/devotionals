    "body": 'Paul wrote, “Don’t copy the behavior and customs of this world” (Romans 12:2 NLT). Easier to say than do, right? It takes courage to defend someone whom everyone else is picking on or to say at a party, “No, I don’t do that.” So where does our courage come from?\nGrace. As Paul also wrote, to Titus, “God’s readiness to give and forgive is now public. Salvation’s available for everyone! … Tell them all this. Build up their courage” (Titus 2:11, 15 MSG). Do you know God’s grace? Then you can love boldly, live robustly. You can swing from trapeze to trapeze; his safety net will break your fall. Nothing fosters courage like a clear grasp of grace.\nThe world wants you to wear what everyone else wears, say what everyone else says, believe what everyone else believes. Be brave enough to be different. Grace gives you the courage to stand up for God.\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
