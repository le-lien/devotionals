    "body": 'When Christ was nailed to the cross, he took off his robe of seamless perfection and assumed a different wardrobe, the wardrobe of indignity.\nThe indignity of nakedness.  Stripped before his own mother and loved ones. Shamed before his family.\nThe indignity of failure.  For a few painfilled hours, the religious leaders were the victors, and Christ appeared the loser. Shamed before his accusers.\nWorst of all, he wore the indignity of sin.  “He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness.”\nThe clothing of Christ on the cross? Sin— yours and mine. The sins of all humanity. ',
