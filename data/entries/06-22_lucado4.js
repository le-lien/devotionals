    "body": 'Every so often a storm will come along, and I’ll look up into the dark sky and say, “God, a little light, please?”\nThat’s probably what the disciples were asking as the storm tossed their boat around the sea. And the light did come for the disciples. A figure came to them walking on the water. It wasn’t what they expected. Maybe they were looking for angels to come down or heaven to open up. We don’t know what they were looking for. But one thing is for sure, they weren’t looking for Jesus to come walking on the water!\nAnd because Jesus came in a way they didn’t expect, they almost missed seeing the answer to their prayers.\nAnd unless we look and listen closely, we risk making the same mistake.\nJust like real thunderstorms, sometimes our lives become stormy, and bad things happen. But God’s lights in our dark storms are as bright as the stars ',
