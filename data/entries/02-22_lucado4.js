God wants to give you a heart like Jesus.\nWhen you become a child of God, He will give you the heart of Jesus. One of the greatest promises of God is simply this: if you give your life to Jesus, He gives Himself to you. He will make your heart His home! Paul said it simply: “Christ [is] living in me” (Galatians 2:20). ',

Spritz it with water two or three times and watch the colors flow, changing the plain, white filter into something beautiful—just as God’s Word changes your ordinary heart into something beautiful!'
