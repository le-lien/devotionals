I went east instead of west and ended up in Houston instead of Denver.\nIt didn’t look like the wrong plane, but it was. I walked through the wrong gate, dozed off on the wrong flight, and ended up in the wrong place.\nDo you know the feeling?\nPaul says we’ve all done the same thing. Not with airplanes and airports, but with our lives and God. He tells the Roman readers, “There is none righteous, no, not one” (Romans 3:10). “All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (v. 23).\nWe are all on the wrong plane, he says. All of us. Gentile and Jew. Rich and poor. Tall and short. Every person has taken the wrong turn. And we need help. The wrong solutions are pleasure and pride; the correct solution is Christ Jesus (Romans 3:21–26).\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
