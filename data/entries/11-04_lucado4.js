This race is not an easy jog, but rather a demanding, hard, sometimes agonizing  race. It takes a huge effort to finish strong.\nUnfortunately, many Christians don’t finish the race. Maybe you’ve seen some who are stopped on the side of the trail of life. They used to be running, living their lives for Christ. There was a time when they kept up.\nBut then they became tired. They never thought the race would be this tough. ',
