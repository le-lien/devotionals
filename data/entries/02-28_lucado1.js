    "body": 'Since the hedonist has never seen the hand who made the universe, he assumes there is no life beyond the here and now. He believes there is no truth beyond this room. No purpose beyond his own pleasure. No divine factor. He has no concern for the eternal… .\nThe hedonist says, “Who cares? I may be bad, but so what? What I do is my business.” He’s more concerned about satisfying his passions than in knowing the Father. His life is so desperate for pleasure that he has no time or room for God.\nIs he right? Is it OK to spend our days thumbing our noses at God and living it up?\nPaul says, “Absolutely not!”\nAccording to Romans 1, we lose more than stained-glass windows when we dismiss God. We lose our standard, our purpose, and our worship.\nIn the Grip of Grace\nMarch\nDepend on the LORD; trust him, and he will take care of you. ',
