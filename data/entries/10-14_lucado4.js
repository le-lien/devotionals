And if you’re not holy, how can you get to heaven?\nBelieve. Believe that the work has already been done for you—Jesus did the work on the cross.\nBelieve in the goodness of Jesus. Believe that you can never earn your way to heaven with your own goodness. Let Jesus give you His goodness instead. Believe in Him and obey His Word.\nIs it really that easy?  you ask. There was nothing easy about it. The cross was heavy, Jesus’ blood was real, and the price was oh-so-costly! You and I could never have paid it, so Jesus paid it for us. Call it simple. Call it a gift.\nBut don’t ever call it easy. ',

How wonderful did that feel? How huge was your sigh of relief? As great as that was, it’s nothing compared to the grace God gives you each and every day.'
