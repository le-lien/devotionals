Honor the fire within you!\nDo you have a passion to sing? Then sing! Are you stirred to manage?\nThen manage! Do you ache for the sick? Then treat them! Do you hurt for the lost? Then teach them! Maybe your dream is to be a diver, a dancer, a veterinarian, a ventriloquist. Go for it!\nAs a young man I felt the call to preach. Unsure if I was correct in my reading of God’s will for me, I sought the counsel of a minister I admired. His advice still rings true. “Don’t preach,” he said, “unless you have to.” As I pondered his words I found my answer: “I have to. If I don’t, the fire will consume me.”\nGod may very well be the source of your passion. What is the fire that consumes you? ',
