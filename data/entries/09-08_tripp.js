    "body": 'Consider how these passages portray God’s law: The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul;\nthe testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple; the precepts of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes; the fear of the LORD is clean, enduring forever;\nthe rules of the LORD are true, and righteous altogether.\nMore to be desired are they than gold, even much fine gold; sweeter also than honey\nand drippings of the honeycomb.\nMoreover, by them is your servant warned; in keeping them there is great reward. (Ps. 19:7–11) Oh how I love your law!\nIt is my meditation all the day.\nYour commandment makes me wiser than my enemies, for it is ever with me.\nI have more understanding than all my teachers, for your testimonies are my meditation. (Ps. 119:97–99) God’s law is not a curse; it is a grace. God’s law is not a burden; it is a gift of his love. Immediately after redeeming his children from the slavery of Egypt, he took them to Mount Sinai to give them his law. He did this because they were the children of his love, the objects of his redemptive glory. As your Creator, he knows you, he knows the world you live in, and he knows the plans he has for you. Because he knows all of these things, he is infinitely more qualified to set the boundaries of your living than you are. He is your sovereign Savior King, not the Suggestion Box Jesus.\nOne of the sad and destructive desires of the sinful nature is the desire for self-rule. One of the dark delusions of sin is that it causes us at points to buy into the insane thought that we might be smarter than God. His grace works in your heart of submission, that is, a heart that esteems his authority and finds joy in his law.',
