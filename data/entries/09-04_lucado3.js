    "body": 'The phrase “take up your cross” has not fared well through the generations.\nAsk for a definition, and you’ll hear answers like “My cross is my little brother, my geometry class, my allergies, my schedule.” The cross, we assume, is any hardship or hassle. God, we think, passes out crosses the way your teacher hands out homework assignments. No one wants one. Each one gets one. Everybody has a cross to bear, and we might as well get used to it.\nBut really. Is Jesus reducing the cross to hassles and headaches? The cross means so much more. It is God’s instrument of salvation—proof of his love for people. To take up the cross, then, is to take up Christ’s burden for the people of the world.\nThough our crosses are similar, none are identical. We each have our own cross to carry—our individual callings. It’s a sweet day when you discover your God-designed task. It fits. It matches your passions and enlists your gifts and talents. Want to blow the cloud cover off your gray day? Accept God’s direction. Take up your cross. ',
