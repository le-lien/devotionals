    "body": 'here is a lot in an amen. I find that you can have zeal without faith. The Scripture reading shows the difference be-T tween the amen of faith and having zeal without faith.\n\nWhen Peter was imprisoned by Herod, the church was in constant prayer for his release. They were even praying all night. They had zeal, but they did not have faith. Although there is much that could be commended to us from this passage, one thing is missing: faith. Young Rhoda had more faith than all the rest of them. When the knock came at the door, she ran to answer it. The moment she heard Peter‘s voice, she was so excited to share the good news that she didn‘t even unlock the gate so that Peter could come in. She ran with joy to tell those praying that Peter stood at the gate.\n\nAll the people said, "You are mad. It isn‘t so." She insisted that she had seen Peter, but the people had no faith at all. They said, "Perhaps God has sent an angel."\n\nBut Rhoda said, "It is Peter." And Peter continued knocking. They went and found him at the door. They had zeal but no faith. God wants to bring us to the place where we will take hold of Him in a living way. We need to rest and always trust the plan of God.\n\nThere was such a difference between Zacharias and Mary. Zacharias definitely wanted a son, but even when the angel came and told him that he would be a father, he was full of unbelief. The angel said, “You will be mute and not able to speak…because you did not believe”  (Luke 1:20). But when the angel came to Mary, she said, “Let it be to me according to your word”  (v. 38). This was the beginning of the amen.\n\nGod wants us to have an inward amen, a mighty moving amen. This amen says, "It is," because God has spoken.',
