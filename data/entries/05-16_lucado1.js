Maybe you’ve slept in your share of hotels or bunked in a few hostels. They have beds.\nThey have tables. They may have food and they may be warm, but they are a far cry from being “your father’s house.”\nYour father’s house is where your father is… .\nWe don’t always feel welcome here on earth. We wonder if there is a place here for us. People can make us feel unwanted. Tragedy leaves us feeling like intruders. Strangers. Interlopers in a land not ours. We don’t always feel welcome here.\nWe shouldn’t. This isn’t our home. To feel unwelcome is no tragedy.\nIndeed it is healthy. We are not home here. This language we speak, it’s not ours. This body we wear, it isn’t us. And the world we live in, this isn’t home. ',
