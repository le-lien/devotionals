    "body": 'On the night before his crucifixion, Jesus gets up from a table, picks up a towel and water basin, and prepares to wash the feet of each of his disciples. Even Judas’s feet, you ask? The lying, conniving, greedy rat who sold Jesus down the river for a pocket of cash? Jesus won’t wash his feet, will he? Sure hope not. If he washes the feet of his Judas, you’ll have to wash the feet of yours. Your betrayer. Your lowlife, good-for-nothing villain. Jesus’\nJudas walked away with thirty pieces of silver. Your Judas walked away with your reputation, idea, virginity, trust, best friend.\nYou expect me to wash his feet and let him go?\nMost people don’t want to. They use the villain’s photo as a dart target.\nMost people keep a pot of anger on low boil. But you aren’t “most people.”\nLook at your feet. They are wet, grace soaked. Jesus has washed the grimiest parts of your life. Your toes and arches and heels have felt the cool basin of God’s grace. ',
