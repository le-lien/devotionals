    "body": 'Most of our prayer lives could use a tune-up.\nSome prayer lives lack consistency. They’re either a desert or an oasis.\nLong, arid, dry spells interrupted by brief plunges into the waters of communion… .\nOthers of us need sincerity. Our prayers are a bit hollow, memorized, and rigid. More liturgy than life. And though they are daily, they are dull.\nStill others lack, well, honesty. We honestly wonder if prayer makes a difference. Why on earth would God in heaven want to talk to me? If God knows all, who am I to tell him anything? If God controls all, who am I to do anything? …\nOur prayers may be awkward. Our attempts may be feeble. But since the power of prayer is in the one who hears it and not the one who says it, our prayers do make a difference. ',
