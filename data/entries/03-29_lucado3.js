Stopping for gas is for wimps.\nIf you’re putting in extra hours each day just to keep up, you need to fill yourself with some high-test fuel. Try some promises from Philippians—six promises from a premium-grade book:\n“I am certain that God, who began the good work within you, will continue his work until it is finally finished” (1:6 NLT). “To me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain” (1:21). “Don’t try to impress others. Be humble, thinking of others as better than yourselves” (2:3 NLT). “I gave up all that inferior stuff so I could know Christ personally, experience his resurrection power, be a partner in his suffering” (3:10 MSG). “I press on to reach the end of the race and receive the heavenly prize” (3:14 NLT). “I can do everything through Christ, who gives me strength” (4:13 NLT).\nFill your tank with verses like these, and stop trying to push yourself around. God is able to do what you can’t. ',
