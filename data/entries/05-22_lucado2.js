One day too high on self, the next too hard on self. Neither is correct. Self-elevation and self-deprecation are equally inaccurate. Where is the truth?\nSmack-dab in the middle. Dead center between “I can do anything” and\n“I can’t do anything” lies “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me” (Phil. 4:13).\nNeither omnipotent nor impotent, neither God’s MVP nor God’s mistake.\nNot self-secure or insecure, but God-secure—a self-worth based in our identity as children of God. The proper view of self is in the middle. ',
