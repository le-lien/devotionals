He turned his back. He ignored the screams of the innocent.\nHe sat in silence while the sins of the world were placed upon his Son.\nAnd he did nothing while a cry a million times bloodier than John’s echoed in the black sky: “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”\nWas it right? No.\nWas it fair? No.\nWas it love? Yes. ',
