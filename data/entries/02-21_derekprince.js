    "body": 'All has been settled by the blood of Jesus!\nThe same Christ who is the only Savior is also the only Deliverer.\nOnly Jesus can break the power of demonic bondage in people’s lives and set them free. I want us to be introduced to the Deliverer in just the same way.\nFor those of us who desire deliverance, we need to make direct, personal contact with Christ. Here are four simple conditions we need to meet: Be sure we have repented. That is, know that we have turned away from every form of sin.\nLook only to Jesus, for He alone is the Deliverer.\nBase our appeals solely on what Jesus did for us through His death on the cross rather than on any “good works” of our own.\nBe sure that, by an act of our wills, we have forgiven every person who ever harmed or wronged us.\nWhen I personally received deliverance from the demon of depression, I received this promise:  “Whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved”  (Joel 2:32). I also remembered these words of Jesus:\n“In My name they [the disciples]  will cast out demons”  (Mark 16:17). In the name of Jesus, we, too, have the authority to expel demons.\nThank You, Lord, for the blood of Jesus. I proclaim that He alone is my Deliverer, and that “whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.” Satan has no place in me, no power over me, no unsettled claims against me. All has been settled by the blood of Jesus! Amen. ',
