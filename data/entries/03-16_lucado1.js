There is never a room so dark … a lounge so sensual . .\n. an office so sophisticated . . . that the ever-present, ever-pursuing, relentlessly tender Friend is not there, tapping gently on the doors of our hearts—waiting to be invited in.\nFew hear his voice. Fewer still open the door.\nBut never interpret our numbness as his absence. For amidst the fleeting promises of pleasure is the timeless promise of his presence.\n“Surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age” (Matt. 28:20\nNIV)… .\nThere is no chorus so loud that the voice of God cannot be heard … if we will but listen.
