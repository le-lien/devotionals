Are you pessimistic about the loyalty of your friends? Give them another chance. No communication with your parents? Try one more time.\nRemember, a finisher is not one with no wounds or weariness. Quite to the contrary, he, like the boxer, is scarred and bloody. Mother Teresa is credited with saying, “God didn’t call us to be successful, just faithful.” The fighter, like our Master, is pierced and full of pain. Like Paul, he may even be bound and beaten. But he keeps going.\nThe Land of Promise, says Jesus, awaits those who endure. It is not just for those who make the victory laps or drink champagne. No, sir. The Land of Promise is for those who simply remain to the end. Your arrival will start a celebration like no other. ',

      "text": 'God honors those who finish. Job suffered through terrible loss and misery yet never lost his faith, and God blessed him almost beyond measure. The same could be said for Joseph and countless others. Trouble making you want to quit? Don’t give in. You can’t imagine what God has waiting for those who finish.'
