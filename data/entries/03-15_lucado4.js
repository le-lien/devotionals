    "body": 'After Jesus rose from the grave, He appeared to two of His disciples. At first, they didn’t know Him, but when they “saw who he was, he disappeared. They said to each other, ‘When Jesus talked to us on the road, it felt like a fire burning in us’ ” (Luke 24:31–32).\nDon’t you love that verse? The disciples knew they had been with Jesus because of the fire inside them. This isn’t a fireplace kind of fire. It’s a spiritual fire. It’s an eagerness to learn more about God and to follow Him.\nGod shows us His will for our lives by touching our hearts with spiritual fire.\nHe gave Jeremiah a spiritual fire for preaching to people who didn’t believe. He gave Nehemiah a fire for rebuilding Jerusalem. He gave Abraham a fire to go to a land he’d never seen.\nAnd Jesus comes to set your heart on fire! He touches heart after heart with His flame, warming cold hearts and bitter souls. He burns away sin and lights up the path for you to follow. ',
