    "body": 'eople crowded around Jesus, so He sat in a boat and taught them in order that all might hear His words. Then Jesus P said to Peter, “Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch”  (Luke 5:4). Peter answered, “We have toiled all night and caught nothing”  (v. 5). Perhaps he was thinking, "Lord, You know nothing about fishing. Daytime is the wrong time to fish." But he said, “Nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net”  (v. 5). I believe every fish in the lake tried to get into that net. They wanted to see Jesus. I must see Jesus.\n\nPeter filled one ship, then another. Oh, what would happen if you lowered all the nets? Believe God! He says, “Look to Me, and be saved”  (Isa. 45:22). He says, “Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest”  (Matt. 11:28). He says, “He who believes in Me has everlasting life”  (John 6:47). Believe! Oh, believe! It is the Word of God.\n\nPeter saw the ship sinking. He looked around and saw Jesus. He fell down at Jesus‘ feet, saying, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!”  (Luke 5:8). He and all who were with him were astonished at the number of fish that they had caught. That spot-less Lamb stood there, and Jesus said to Peter, “Do not be afraid. From now on you will catch men”  (v. 10).\n\nTo see Jesus is to see a new way, to see all things differently. It means a new life and new plans. As we gaze at Him, we are satisfied; there is none like Him. Sin moves away.\n\nJesus was the express image of the Father (Heb. 1:3). The Father could not be in the midst, so He clothed Jesus with a body—as well as with eternal resources. Let us gather together unto Him. Let us move toward Him. He has all we need. He will fulfill the desires of our hearts, granting all our petitions.',
