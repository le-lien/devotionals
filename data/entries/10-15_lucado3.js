Guilty and proud of it.\nWe’re like Barabbas. Sinners. Murderers. It doesn’t matter if we’ve literally killed someone. The point is that we are rebels against God. We roar,\n“I want to run my own life, thank you very much!” We tell God to get out, get lost, and not come back. Like Barabbas, we deserve to die. Four prison walls, thickened with fear, hurt, and hate, surround us. We have been found guilty.\nAnd we have nothing to offer in trade for our lives.\nOur executioner’s footsteps echo against stone walls. We don’t look up as he opens the door. We know what he’s going to say. “Time to pay up.” But we hear something else. “You’re free to go. They took Jesus instead of you.”\nWhat just happened?  Grace happened. ',
