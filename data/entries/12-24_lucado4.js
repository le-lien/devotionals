It seems like Jesus’ not-so-great-grandparents made some big mistakes. But God still promised to use them to send His Son.\nWhy did God use these people? He didn’t have to. He could have just laid the Savior on a doorstep. Would have been simpler that way. And why does God tell us their stories in the Bible?\nSimple. He wants us to know that when His people mess up and the world goes wild, God stays calm.\nWant proof? Read the last name in Jesus’ family tree. In spite of all the mixed-up mess-ups of His ancestors, the last name on the list is the one He promised—Jesus. ',
