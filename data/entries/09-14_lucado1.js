    "body": 'What if someone were to film a documentary on your hands? What if a producer were to tell your story based on the life of your hands? What would we see? As with all of us, the film would begin with an infant’s fist, then a close-up of a tiny hand wrapped around mommy’s finger. Then what? Holding on to a chair as you learned to walk? …\nWere you to show the documentary to your friends, you’d be proud of certain moments: your hands extending with a gift, placing a ring on another’s finger, doctoring a wound, preparing a meal… . And then there are other scenes. . . . Hands taking more often than giving, demanding instead of offering… .\nOh, the power of our hands. Leave them unmanaged and they become weapons: clawing for power, strangling for survival, seducing for pleasure.\nBut manage them and our hands become instruments of grace—not just tools in the hands of God, but God’s very hands.
