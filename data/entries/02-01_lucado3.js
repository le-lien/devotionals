    "body": 'To accept God’s grace is to accept God’s offer to be adopted into his family.\nYour identity is not in your friends, possessions, talents, tattoos, grades, or accomplishments. Nor are you defined by your family’s divorce or debt, or your dumb choices. You are God’s child. You get to call him “Papa.” You receive the blessings of his special love (1 John 4:9–11) and provision (Luke 11:11–13). You will inherit the riches of Christ and reign with him forever (Romans 8:17).\nThe adoption is horizontal as well as vertical. You are included in the forever family. A community is created on the basis of a common father.\nInstant family worldwide!\nRather than try to invent reasons to feel good about yourself, trust God’s verdict. If God loves you, you must be worth loving. If he wants to have you in his kingdom, then you must be worth having. God’s grace invites you—no, requires you—to change your attitude about yourself and take sides with God against your feelings of rejection.\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
