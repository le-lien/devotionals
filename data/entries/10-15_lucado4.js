Because “God is Spirit” (John 4:24), He is next to you: God Himself is the roof over your head and the walls that protect you.\nMoses knew this. “Lord,” he prayed, “you have been our home since the beginning” (Psalm 90:1). Wow! God is your home. Home is where you can kick off your shoes and eat pickles and not worry about sitting around in your jammies. ',

      "text": 'Growing in Grace It’s great to have your own room—a place to call your very own. While you may not have your own room right now, in heaven you will. Check out John 14:2: “There are many rooms in my Father’s house… . I am going there to prepare a place for you.” That’s right! Jesus is preparing a room just for you!'
