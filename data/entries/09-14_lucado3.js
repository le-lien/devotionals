For what have you been casting?\nFaith? “I want to believe, but …” Healing? “I’ve been sick so long …”\nHope? “Nothing seems to make a difference …”\nYou’ve worked hard all night and caught nothing. You’ve felt what Peter felt. You’ve sat where Peter sat. And now Jesus is asking you to go fishing.\nHe knows your nets are empty. He knows your heart is weary. He knows you’d like nothing more than to turn your back on the mess and call it a life.\nBut he urges, “It’s not too late to try again.”\nSee if Peter’s reply won’t help you decide on your own. “I will do as You say and let down the nets” (Luke 5:5 NASB).
