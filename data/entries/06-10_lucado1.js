Share them when you can.\nPray all the time. If necessary, use words.\nGod forgets the past. Imitate him.\nGreed I’ve often regretted. Generosity—never.\nDon’t ask God to do what you want. Ask God to do what is right.\nNo one is useless to God. No one.\nNails didn’t hold God to a cross. Love did.\nYou will never forgive anyone more than God has already forgiven you. ',
