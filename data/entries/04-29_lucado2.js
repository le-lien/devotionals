    "body": 'Before you speak, ask: Will what I’m about to say help others become stronger? You have the ability, with your words, to make a person stronger.\nYour words are to their soul what a vitamin is to their body. If you had food and saw someone starving, would you not share it? If you had water and saw someone dying of thirst, would you not give it? Of course you would.\nThen won’t you do the same for their hearts? Your words are food and water!\nDo not withhold encouragement from the discouraged.\nDo not keep affirmation from the beaten down!\nSpeak words that make people stronger. Believe in them as God has believed in you. ',
