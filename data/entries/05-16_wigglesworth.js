    "body": 'If I cannot make a person who is suffering from disease righteously indignant against that condition, I cannot help him. I If I can make every sufferer know that suffering, disease, and all these things are the workings of the Devil, I can help him.\n\nIf you can see that the Devil is after you, to kill you for all he is worth, believe that Christ is enthroned in your heart to destroy the very principles of the Devil in every way. Have the reality of this; build upon it by perfect soundness until you are in the place of perfect bliss, for to know Christ is perfect bliss. Be so built in Him that you are not afraid of evil. You must have a fullness that presses out beyond; you must have a life that is full of divine power; you must have a mind that is perfectly in Christ; you must cease to be natural and begin to be supernatural.\n\nAre you ready to be so changed by God that you will never have this human fear anymore? Remember that “perfect love casts out fear”  (1 John 4:18).\n\nStep into the full tide of the life of the manifestation of God. Your new nature has no corruption in it. Eternal life is not just during your lifetime; it is forever. You are regenerated by the power of the Word of God, and it is in you as an incorruptible force, taking you on from victory to victory until death itself can be overcome, until sin has no authority, until disease could not be in the body. This is a living fact by the Word of God.\n\nRight in this present moment, there is “no condemnation” (Rom. 8:1). This law of the Spirit of life is a law in the body; it is a law of eternity; it is a law of God, a new law. It is not the law of the Ten Commandments, but a law of life in the body, changing you until there is no sin power, no disease power, and no death power.\n\nYou who desire to go a thousand miles through faith, beyond what you have ever gone before, leap into it. Believe that the blood 224\n\nof Christ makes you clean; believe that you have come into resurrection life. Believe it!\n\nTrying is an effort, whereas believing is a fact. Don‘t join the Endeavor Society, but come into the Faith Society, and you will leap into the promises of God, which are “Yes”  and “Amen” (2 Cor. 1:20) to all who believe.\n\nDon‘t look down your nose and murmur anymore. Have a rejoicing spirit; get the praise of God in your heart; go forth from victory to victory; rise in faith, and believe it. You must not live in yourself; you must live in Christ. “Set your mind on things above” (Col. 3:2), and keep your whole spirit alive in God. Let your inheritance be so full of divine life that you live above the world and all its thoughts and cares.',
