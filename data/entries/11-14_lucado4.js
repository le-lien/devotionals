What once stood so proud and strong can easily be knocked over at the edge of the water.\nSometimes we can be like bruised reeds. Maybe we stood so tall and so proud once, thinking life was just right. Then something happened. We were bruised by mean words, someone’s anger, or a friend’s betrayal.\nThe bruised reed. This world knows what to do with us when we’re no longer standing up tall. This world wants to break us so that we can never stand up tall again. ',
