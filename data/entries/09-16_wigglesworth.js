    "body": 'The Spirit of the Lord must have His way in everything. Oh, what would happen if we would all loosen up! Sometimes I T think it is almost necessary to give an address to those who are already baptized in the Holy Spirit. I feel that, just like the Corinthian church, we may have, as it were, gifts and graces, and we may use them all, but we sit in them and do not go on beyond where we are.\n\nI maintain that all gifts and graces are only for one thing: to make you desire gifts and graces. Don‘t miss what I say. Every touch of the divine life by the Spirit is only for one purpose: to make your life go on to a higher height than where you are. Beloved, if anybody has to rise up in the meeting to tell me how they were baptized with the Holy Spirit in order for me to know they are baptized, I say, "You have fallen from grace. You ought to have such a baptism that everybody can tell you are baptized without your telling how you were baptized." That would make a new day. That would be a sermon in itself to everybody, not only in here but also outside. Then people would follow you to get to know where you have come from and where you are going. (See John 3:8.) You say, "I want that. I won‘t settle until I get that." God will surely give it to you.\n\nThe Holy Spirit can only come into us (His temples) when we are fully yielded to Him, for the Spirit “does not dwell in temples made with hands”  (Acts 7:48) but in “tablets of flesh, that is, of the heart”  (2 Cor. 3:3). So it doesn‘t matter what kind of a building you get; you cannot count on the building being a substitute for the Ho-ly Spirit. You will all have to be temples of the Holy Spirit for the building to be anything like Holy Spirit order.',
