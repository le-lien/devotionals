Am I full of the little things that cheer His heart over me, or am I whimpering because things are going hardly with me? There is no joy in the soul that has forgotten what God prizes. It is a great thing to think that Jesus Christ has need of me - “Give Me to drink.” How much kindness have I shown Him this past week? Have I been kind to His reputation in my life?',

    "body": 'God is saying to His people - You are not in love with Me now, but I remember the time when you were - “I remember … the love of thine espousals.” Am I as full of the extravagance of love to Jesus\nChrist as I was in the beginning, when I went out of my way to prove my devotion to Him? Does He find me recalling the time when I did not care for anything but Himself? Am I there now, or have I become wise over loving Him? Am I so in love with Him that I take no account of where I go? or am I watching for the respect due to me; weighing how much service I ought to give?\nIf, as I recall what God remembers about me, I find He is not what He used to be to me, let it produce shame and humiliation, because that shame will bring the godly sorrow that works repentance.
