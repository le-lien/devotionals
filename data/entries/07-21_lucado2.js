    "body": 'When my oldest daughter, Jenna, was four years old, she came to me with a confession. “Daddy, I took a crayon and drew on the wall.” (Kids amaze me with their honesty.)\nI sat down and lifted her up into my lap and tried to be wise. “Is that a good thing to do?” I asked her.\n“No.”\n“What does Daddy do when you write on the wall?”\n“You spank me.”\n“What do you think Daddy should do this time?”\n“Love.”\nDon’t we all want that? Don’t we all long for a father who, even though our mistakes are written all over the wall, will love us anyway?\nWe do have that type of a father. A father who is at his best when we are at our worst. A father whose grace is strongest when our devotion is weakest. ',
