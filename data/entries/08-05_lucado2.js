    "body": 'Are you in prison? You are if you feel better when you have more and worse when you have less. You are if joy is one delivery away, one transfer away, one award away, or one makeover away. If your happiness comes from something you deposit, drive, drink, or digest, then face it— you are in prison, the prison of want.\nThat’s the bad news. The good news is, you have a visitor. And your visitor has a message that can get you paroled. Make your way to the receiving room. Take your seat in the chair, and look across the table at the psalmist David. He motions for you to lean forward. “I have a secret to tell you,” he whispers, “the secret of satisfaction. ‘The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want’” (Ps. 23:1 NKJV).\nIt’s as if he is saying, “What I have in God is greater than what I don’t have in life.”\nYou think you and I could learn to say the same?
