    "body": 'Fellowship is the first test of whether we are walking in the light. If we are not enjoying fellowship with our fellow believers and with the Lord, then we are not in the light, and if we are not in the light, the blood of Jesus does not cleanse us.\nThe next question, then, concerns how we walk in the light. The first condition is that we must walk in obedience to the Word of God.\nPsalm 119:105 says, “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.”  The second requirement is summed up by Paul in Ephesians 4:15, where he wrote, “Speaking the truth in love, may [we]  grow up in all things into Him who is the head; Christ.”\nIn this passage, “walking in the light” is defined as relating to our fellow believers in truth and in love. We must be willing to act in truth in our relationships with one another, but we have to do so in love.\nThus, walking in the light consists of two things put together: walking in obedience to the Word of God and walking in truth and love with our fellow believers. When we meet those conditions, then we can say with full assurance that the blood of Jesus is cleansing us from all sin.\nToday we are very conscious of the physical pollution of the atmosphere around us, but the spiritual atmosphere is also polluted by sin, corruption, and ungodliness. In order to be kept clean, we need the continual cleansing of the blood of Jesus. ',
