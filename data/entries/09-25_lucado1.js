One you don’t even know? We’ve always assumed that the name we got is the name we will keep. Not so… . The road ahead is so bright a fresh name is needed. Your eternity is so special no common name will do.\nSo God has one reserved just for you. There is more to your life than you ever thought. There is more to your story than what you have read… .\nAnd so I plead… . Be there when God whispers your name. ',
