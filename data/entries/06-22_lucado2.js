    "body": 'During our summer vacation I took . . . advantage of the occasion to solicit a sailing lesson. Ever puzzled by the difference in leeward, starboard, and stern, I asked the crew a few questions. After a while the captain offered, “Would you like to sail us home?”… He assured me I would have no trouble. “Target that cliff,” he instructed. “Set your eyes and the boat on it.”\nI found the instruction hard to follow. Other sights invited my attention: the rich mahogany of the deck, rich foam cresting on the waves. I wanted to look at it all. But look too long and risk losing the course. The boat stayed on target as long as I set my eyes beyond the vessel.\nWorship helps us do this in life. It lifts our eyes off the boat with its toys and passengers and sets them “on the realities of heaven, where Christ sits at God’s right hand in the place of honor and power” (Col. 3:1 NLT). ',
