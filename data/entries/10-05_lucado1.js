So we beg for help. Hear his voice.\nAnd step out in fear, hoping that our little faith will be enough… .\nFaith is a desperate dive out of the sinking boat of human effort and a prayer that God will be there to pull us out of the water. Paul wrote about this kind of faith … :\n“For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast”\n(Eph. 2:8–9 NIV).
