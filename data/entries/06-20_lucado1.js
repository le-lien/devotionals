    "body": 'Go back and report to John what you hear and see: “The blind receive sight, the lame walk … and the good news is preached to the poor.”\nThis was Jesus’ answer to John’s agonized query from the dungeon of doubt: “Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?”\nWe don’t know how John received Jesus’ message, but we can imagine. I like to think of a slight smile coming over his lips as he heard what his Master said. For now he understood. It wasn’t that Jesus was silent; it was that John had been listening for the wrong answer. John had been listening for an answer to his earthly problems, while Jesus was busy resolving his heavenly ones.\nThat’s worth remembering the next time you hear the silence of God. ',
