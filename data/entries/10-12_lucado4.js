To see Him as Father is to go a step further. A father should be the one in your life who provides for you and protects you. Earthly fathers sometimes fail at this, but God does not. See what He has done for you:\nHe has taken care of all your needs (Matthew 6:25–34).\nHe has protected you from harm (Psalm 139:5).\nHe has adopted you as His own child (Ephesians 1:5).\nAnd He has given you His name (1 John 3:1).
