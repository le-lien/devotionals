    "body": 'Every Christmas, musicians around the world gather to perform George Frederic Handel’s famous oratorio <i>The Messiah</i>. The entire work is over a hundred pages long. But suppose at the time George was writing it, his wife came upon one page on their kitchen table. On it, her husband had written only one measure, in a minor key, one that didn’t work on its own. Suppose she, armed with this fragment of discord, marched into his studio and said, “This music makes no sense. You are a lousy composer.” What would he think?\nPerhaps something similar to what God thinks when we do the same. We point to our minor key, our broken leg, our divorced parents, our sick brother. “This makes no sense!” Yet, of all of his creation, how much have we seen? Only a doorway peephole. And, of all his work, how much do we understand? Only a sliver. What if God’s answer to the question of suffering requires more megabytes than our puny minds have been given?\nThink about it. ',

      "text": 'Imagine the genius of someone like Beethoven, composing beautiful symphonies even after he was deaf, hearing the blend of each complex part only in his mind. Now multiply that genius by a billion and more and you begin to get a vague idea of what God does as he composes the symphony of our lives.'
