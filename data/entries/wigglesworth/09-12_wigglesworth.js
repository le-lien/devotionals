    "body": 'od wants to help us to see that every child of God ought to receive the Holy Spirit. Beloved, God wants us to understand G that this is not difficult when we are in the right order. I want you to see what it means to seek the Holy Spirit.\n\nIf we were to examine John‘s gospel, we would see that Jesus predicted all that we are getting today with the coming of the Holy Spirit. Our Lord said that the Holy Spirit would take of the things of His Word and reveal them to us. (See John 14:26; 16:14.) He would live out in us all of the life of Jesus.\n\nIf we could only think of what this really means! It is one of the ideals. Talk about graduation! Come into the graduation of the Holy Spirit, and you will simply outstrip everything they have in any college there ever was. You will leave them all behind, just as I have seen the sun leave the mist behind in San Francisco. You will leave what is as cold as ice and go into the sunshine.\n\nGod the Holy Spirit wants us to know the reality of this fullness of the Spirit so that we will neither be ignorant nor have mys-tic conceptions but will have a clear, unmistakable revelation of the entire mind of God for these days.\n\nI implore you, beloved, in the name of Jesus, that you should see that you come right into all the mind of God. Jesus truly said, “But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you”  (Acts 1:8).',
