We each have our own work, and we must do it, so that boldness may be ours in the day of the Master‘s appearing, and so that no man can take our crowns (Rev. 3:11). Since the Lord is always encourag-ing us, we have encouragement for others. We must have a willingness, a ready mind, a yielding to the mind of the Spirit. There is no place for the child of God in God‘s great plan except in humility.\n\nGod can never do all He wants to do, all that He came to do through the Word, until He gets us to the place where He can trust us, and where we are in abiding fellowship with Him   in His great plan for the world‘s redemption. We have this truth illustrated in the life of Jacob. It took God twenty-one years to bring Jacob to the place of humility, contrition of heart, and brokenness of spirit. God even gave him power to wrestle with strength, and Jacob said, "I think I can manage after all," until God touched his thigh, making him know that he was mortal and that he was dealing with immortality. As long as we think we can save ourselves, we will try to do it.\n\nIn Mark 5:25–34, we have the story of the woman who had suffered many things from many physicians and had spent all that she had. She was no better but rather grew worse. She said, “If only I may touch His clothes, I shall be made well.”  She came to know her need. It is when we are empty and undone,   when we come to God in our nothingness and helplessness, that He picks us up.',
