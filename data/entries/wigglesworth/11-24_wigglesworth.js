    "body": 'elievers should try the spirits. You can see whether they are of God in this way: you will be able to tell the true reve-B lation, and the true revelation that will come to you will always sanctify the heart; it will never have an "if" in it. When the Devil came to Jesus, he had an "if." He said, “If You are the Son of God”  (Matt. 4:3), and “If You will fall down and worship me”  (v. 9). The Holy Spirit never comes with an "if."\n\nI have often dealt with people under evil powers, people in fits and other things, people so controlled by evil powers that every time they want to speak, the evil powers speak. It is a very dangerous condition, but it is true: people get possessed by the Devil.\n\nDo you remember the biblical account of the man in the tombs who was terribly afflicted with evil powers (Mark 5:2–15)? Strong cords and chains could not hold him. Night and day, he was in the tombs, “crying out and cutting himself with stones”  (v. 5). Jesus came on the scene, and these evil powers caused the man to run. As soon as the man got in front of Jesus, the evil spirit said, “Have You come here to torment us before the time?”  (Matt. 8:29). This man had no power to get free, but these evil spirits were so troubled in the presence of Jesus that they cried out, “Have You come here to torment us before the time?”\n\nOh, thank God for Jesus. Jesus wants you to be so under His power, so controlled by and filled with the Holy Spirit, that the power of authority in you will resist all evil.\n\nSo many believers are not on their guard. Every believer should reach a place in the Holy Spirit where he has no desire except the desire of God. The Holy Spirit has to possess us until we are filled and divinely led by the Holy Spirit. It is a mighty thing to be filled with the Holy Spirit.',
