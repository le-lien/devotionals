    "body": 'In Sydney, Australia, a man with a cane passed by a friend and me. He had to get down and then twist over, and the I torture on his face made a deep impression on my soul. I asked myself, "Is it right to pass by this man?" So I said to my friend, "There is a man in awful distress, and I cannot go farther. I must speak to him." I went over to this man and said to him, "You seem to be in great trouble." "Yes," he said, "I am no good and never will be." I said, "You see that hotel? Be in front of that door in five minutes, and I will pray for you, and you will be able to stand as straight as any man here." This statement exercised my faith in Jesus.\n\nI came back after paying a bill, and he was there. I will never forget him wondering if he was going to be trapped, or why a man would stop him on the street and tell him he would be made to stand straight. However, I had said it, so it had to be. If you say anything, you must stand with God to make it so. Never say anything for bravado, unless you have the right to say it. Always be sure of your ground, and be sure that you are honoring God. If there is anything about the situation that will make you anything, it will bring you sorrow. Your whole ministry has to be along the lines of grace and blessing.\n\nWe helped him up the two steps, took him to the elevator, and got him upstairs. It was difficult to get him from the elevator to my room, as though Satan was making the last attempt for his life, but we got him there. In five minutes‘ time this man walked out of that room with his body as straight as any man‘s. He walked perfectly and declared he hadn‘t a pain in his body.\n\nIf God will stretch out His mighty power to loose afflicted legs, what mercy will He extend to that soul of yours that must exist forever? He invites you: “Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest”  (Matt. 11:28). God is willing in His great mercy to touch limbs with His mighty power, and if He 149\n\nis willing to do this, how much more eager He is to deliver from the power of Satan. How much more necessary it is for us to be healed of our soul sicknesses than of our bodily ailments! God is willing to give the double cure.\n\nBeloved, it is ministry; it is operation; it is manifestation! Those are three of the leading principles of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. We must see to it that God is producing these three through us.\n\nThe Bible is the Word of God. It has the truths, and whatever people may say of them, they stand stationary, unmovable. Not one word of all His good promises will fail (1 Kings 8:56). His Word will come forth. In heaven it is settled (Ps. 119:89). On earth the fact must be made manifest that He is the God of everlasting power.',
