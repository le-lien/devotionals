    "body": 'ook at the tremendous power of God behind our inheritance. First, we are adopted; then we receive an inheritance; then L we are made coheirs with Jesus. God touches our souls, making our whole bodies cry out for the living God.\n\nDo you want God? Do you want fellowship in the Spirit? Do you want to walk with Him? Do you desire communion with Him? Everything else is no good. You want the association with God, and God says, “I will come in to [you] and dine with [you] , and [you] with Me.”  Hallelujah! We can attain spiritual maturity, fullness of Christ, a place where God becomes the perfect Father and the Holy Spirit has a rightful place now as never before.\n\nThe Holy Spirit breathes through us, enabling us to say, "You are my Father." Because you have been adopted, “God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, „Abba, Father!‟”  (Gal. 4:6). May God the Holy Spirit grant to us that richness of His pleasure, that unfolding of His will, that consciousness of His smile upon us. There is “no condemnation”  (Rom. 8:1). We find that “the law of the Spirit of life”  makes us “free from the law of sin and death”  (v. 2). Glory!\n\nIf we see the truth as clearly as God intends for us to see it, we will all be made so much richer, looking forward to the Blessed One who is coming again. Here we are, face-to-face with the facts. God has shown us different aspects of the Spirit. He has shown us the pavilion of splendor. He has revealed to us the power of the relationship of sonship. He has shown us that those who are God‘s children bear His image. They actively claim the rights of their adoption. They speak, and it is done. They bind the things that are loose, and loose the things that are bound (Matt. 16:19). And the perfection of sonship is so evident that more and more people are becoming children of God.\n\nDo you believe it? Let us see you act it. Beloved, God the Holy Spirit has a perfect plan to make us a movement. There is a difference between a movement and a monument. A movement is something that is always active. A monument is something that is 277\n\nerected on a corner and neither speaks nor moves, but there is a tremendous lot of humbug and nonsense to get it in place. It is silent and does nothing. A movement is where God comes into the very being of a person, making him active for God. He is God‘s property, God‘s mouthpiece, God‘s eyes, and God‘s hands. God will " sanctify you completely” (1 Thess. 5:23).\n\nThe sanctification of the eyes, the hands, the mouth, the ears—to be so controlled by the Spirit who lives within us—is a wonderful place for God to bring us to. “Beloved, now we are children of God; and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be”  (1 John 3:1–2). What a great thought: to be heirs, “joint heirs with Christ” (Rom. 8:17); to receive revelations and kindnesses from God; to have God dwell within man. The believer is filled, moved, and intensified until he takes wing. It would not take a trumpet to rouse him, for he is already on the wing, and he will land very soon. He would hear God‘s voice no matter how much noise surrounded him.\n\nEverything that is going to help you, you have to make yours. He has stored it up already. You don‘t need a stepladder to get to it. It is ready to be handed to you when you become joined with Him. Beloved, it is impossible in our finite condition to estimate the lovingkindness or the measureless mind of God. When we come into like-mindedness with the Word, instead of looking at the Word, we begin to see what God has for us in the Word. Our prayer will be,\n\nMe with a quenchless thirst inspire,\n\nA longing, infinite desire\n\nFill my craving heart.\n\nLess than Thyself You do not give,\n\nThy might within me now to live.\n\nCome, all Thou hast. God, please come and make it impossible for me to ever be satisfied but to always have an unquenchable desire for You, the living God. Then I will not be overtaken. Then I will be ready. Then I will have shining eyes, filled with delight as they look at the Master.',
