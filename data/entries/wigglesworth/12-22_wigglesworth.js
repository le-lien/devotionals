    "body": 'any people make wills and appoint someone to carry out their final requests. After the person dies, very often M those people who have had property left to them never get it because of unfaithful stewards who have been left in charge. But there is one will that has been left, and He who made the whole will is our Lord Jesus Christ. After dying, He rose to carry out His own will. And now we may have all that has been left to us by Him: all the inheritance, all the blessings, all the power, all the life, and all the victory. All His promises are ours because He is risen. I believe the Lord wants us to know our inheritance.\n\nJesus invites you, “Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest”  (Matt. 11:28). God is willing in His great mercy to touch you with His mighty power; if He is willing to do this, how much more eager He is to deliver you from the power of Satan and to make you a child of the King! How much more necessary it is for you to be healed of your soul sickness than of your bodily ailments!\n\nBecause He is risen as a faithful High Priest, He is here to help us understand His divine principles. May God provide us with a clear knowledge of what He means for us in these days. He has called us to great banquets and wants us to bring good appetites to His table.\n\nIt is a serious thing to come to a banquet of the Lord and not be able to eat anything. We must have very thirsty conditions and hungry souls. Then we can have what is prepared for us. We can be “strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man” (Eph. 3:16). May the Lord take us into His treasures now.',
