    "body": 'here are people today who have lived holy lives, preached sanctification, and their language of tongues has been help-T ful, but something has come in the way. They have lost their zeal and fire, but they still hold onto the language. This can take place in anyone‘s life.\n\nI would like you to know that the speaker is no good unless he judges himself every day. If I do not judge myself, I will be judged (1 Cor. 11:31). It is no good to me if I look good to you. If there were one thing between me and God, I would not dare to speak to others unless I knew that God had made me holy, for they who bear the vessels of the Lord must be holy unto the Lord (Isa. 52:11). And I praise God because I know:\n\nHis blood can make the vilest clean,\n\nHis blood can make the vilest clean,\n\nHis blood avails for me,\n\nHis blood avails for me. You cannot assume that someone is still living in the center of God‘s holy will. Because I am only a man, it is possible that I may have grieved the Spirit. If I were to speak in a formal language without unction, that would not move the people. In this type of situation, someone in the place—and this is what tongues are for— someone in the place who is hungry for God and cannot rest because he is not getting the cream of the truth would begin travail-ing and groaning in the Spirit and speaking in tongues. Another person would travail in the same way, receiving the interpretation of these tongues, and would arise and give that interpretation, thus lifting the people where the prophet could not because he was out of the will of God.',
