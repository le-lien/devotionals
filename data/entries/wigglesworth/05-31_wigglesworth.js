    "body": 'The Lord has called us to share in His glory and power. As our faith claims His promises, we will see this truth evi-T denced. I remember one day I was holding a meeting. My uncle came to that meeting and said, "Aunt Mary would like to see you before she dies." I went to see her, and she was assuredly dying. I said, "Lord, can‘t You do something?" All I did was stretch out my hands and lay them on her. It seemed as though there was an immediate touch of the glory and power of the Lord. Aunt Mary cried, "It is going all over my body." That day she was made perfectly whole.\n\nOne day I was preaching, and a man brought a boy who was wrapped up in bandages. It was impossible for him to walk, so it was difficult for them to get him to the platform. They passed him over about six seats. The power of the Lord was present to heal, and it entered right into the child as I placed my hands on him. The child cried, "Daddy, it is going all over me." They took off the boy‘s bandages and found nothing wrong with him.\n\nThe Lord wants us to be walking letters of His Word. Jesus is the Word and is the power in us. It is His desire to work in and through us “for His good pleasure”  (Phil. 2:13). We must believe that He is in us. There are boundless possibilities for us if we dare to act in God and dare to believe that the wonderful power of our living Christ will be made clear through us as we lay our hands on the sick in His name (Mark 16:18).\n\nI feel the Holy Spirit is grieved with us when we know these things but do not do greater deeds for God. Does not the Holy Spirit show us wide-open doors of opportunity? Will we not let God lead us to greater things? Will we not believe God to take us on to greater demonstrations of His power?',
