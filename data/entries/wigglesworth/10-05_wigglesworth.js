    "body": 'aul did not have any power of his own that enabled him to use the name of Jesus as he did. But when he had to go P through the privations and the difficulties, and even when all things seemed as if they were shipwrecked, God stood by him and caused him to know that there was Someone with him, supporting him all the time, who was able to carry him through and bring out what his heart was longing for all the time. He seemed to be so unconsciously filled with the Holy Spirit that all that was needed was to bring the aprons and the handkerchiefs to him and then send them forth to heal and deliver. I can imagine these itine-rant Jewish exorcists and these seven sons of Sceva in Ephesus looking on and seeing him and saying, "The power seems to be all in the name. Don‘t you notice that when he sends out the handkerchiefs and the aprons, he says, ‗In the name of the Lord Jesus, I command the evil spirit to come out‘?" (See Acts 19.) These people had been watching, and they thought, "It is only the name; that is all that is needed," and so they said, "We will do the same." They were determined to make this thing work, and they came to a man who was possessed with an evil power. As they entered into the house where he was, they said, "We charge you in the name of Jesus, whom Paul preaches, to come out." The demon said, “Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?”  (Acts 19:15). Then the evil power leaped upon them and tore their clothes off their backs, and they went out naked and wounded.\n\nOh, that God would help us to understand the name of Jesus! There is something in that name that attracts the whole world. It is the name, oh, it is still the name, but you must understand that there is the ministry of the name. It is the Holy Spirit who is behind the ministry. The power is in knowing Him.',
