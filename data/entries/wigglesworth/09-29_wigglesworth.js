    "body": 'It has been a long time now since the debt of sin was settled, our redemption was secured, and death was abolished. MorI tality is a hindrance, but death no longer has power. Sin no longer has dominion. You reign in Christ; you take hold of His finished work. Don‘t groan and travail for a week if you are in need; “only believe”  (Mark 5:36). Don‘t fight to get some special thing; “only believe.”  It is according to your faith that you will receive (Matt. 9:29). God blesses you with faith. “Have faith in God” (Mark 11:22). If you are free in God, believe, and it will come to pass.\n\n“If then you were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God”  (Col. 3:1). Stir yourselves up, beloved! Where are you? I have been planted with Christ in the likeness of His death, and I am risen with Christ (Rom. 6:5 KJV). It was a beautiful planting. I am seated with Him in heavenly places (Eph. 2:6). God credits me with righteousness through faith in Christ (Rom. 4:5), and I believe Him.\n\nWhy should I doubt? Why do you doubt? Faith reigns. God makes it possible. How many receive the Holy Spirit, and Satan gets a doubt in? Don‘t doubt; believe. There is power and strength in Him; who will dare to believe God?\n\nLeave Doubting Street; live on Faith-Victory Street. Jesus sent the seventy out, and they came back in victory. (See Luke 10:1–18.) It takes God to make it real. Dare to believe until there is not a sick person, until there is no sickness, until everything that is not of God is withered, and the life of Jesus is implanted within.',
