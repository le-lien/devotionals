    "body": 'here are glories upon glories, and joys upon joys, exceeding joys and an abundance of joys, and a measureless measure. T Beloved, when we get the Word so wonderfully into our hearts, it absolutely changes us in everything. As we feast on the Word of the Lord, eat and digest the truth, inwardly eat of Him, we are absolutely changed every day from one state of grace to another.\n\nLook into the perfect mirror of the face of the Lord, and you will be changed “from glory to glory.”  You will never find anything else except the Word of God to take you there. So you cannot afford to put aside the Word.\n\nI implore you, beloved, that you do not come short in your own lives of any of these blessed teachings we have been sharing. These grand truths of the Word of God must be your testimony, must be your life, must be your pattern. You must be in the Word; in fact, you are of the Word. God says to you by the Spirit that “you are an epistle of Christ”  (2 Cor. 3:3). Let us see to it that we put off everything so that by the grace of God we may put on everything.\n\nWhere there is a standard that hasn‘t been reached in your life, God, in His grace, by His mercy and your yieldedness, can equip you for that place. He can prepare you for that place that you can never be prepared for except by a broken heart and a contrite spirit, except by yielding to the will of God. If you will come with a whole heart to the throne of grace, God will meet you and build you on His spiritual plane. Amen. Praise the Lord!',
