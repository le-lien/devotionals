    "body": 'The voices continued. Ah, those evil voices. How will we know whether they are of God? When God speaks, He speaks with T wisdom. When the Devil came to Jesus he said, “If You are the Son of God”  (Matt. 4:3). The Devil knew that Jesus was the Son of God, and Jesus knew and answered, “It is written, „You shall worship the LORD your God, and Him only you shall serve‟”  (v. 10).\n\nWas there anything wrong with what was happening with these two young women? The wrong was that the first young woman ought to have judged the spirits. If she had asked, "Did Jesus come in the flesh?" the voice would have answered no. No satanic voice in the world and no Spiritualist medium will acknowledge that Jesus came in the flesh.\n\nThe same power said to the young woman, "Now that I know you will obey me in everything, I will make you the greatest missionary in the world."\n\nHow could the two women have known at that moment that this was a false voice? Why, they could have known according to the Word of God. What does it say? “Many false prophets have gone out into the world”  (1 John 4:1). Who are these false prophets after? Perhaps those with sincerity, earnestness, zeal, and purity. Who knows? These evil powers know. These are the questions they should have kept in their minds: What am I living for? What is the hope of my life? Do I have to be the greatest missionary in the world, or does Jesus need to be glorified in my life to do as He wills with me? The ripe grape is never as pure and perfect as it is just before it decays. The child of God is never as near to God as he is when the Devil can come and say, "You are wonderful!"\n\nIt is satanic to feel that God has a special message for you and that you are someone more special than anyone else. Every place that God brings you to in a rising tide of perfection is a place of humility, brokenness of heart, and fullness of surrender, where 506\n\nonly God can rule in authority. It is not where you are somebody, but where God is everything and where you will be living for His glory.\n\nIt took three difficult months before these two young women were delivered from their delusion. But God did deliver them, and later He opened the door for them to go as missionaries to China. Thank God, the Devil‘s plan was defeated, but it was at a tremendous cost, almost of their lives.\n\nHow could they have known that it was a false voice? How can you know? When a voice comes, no matter how it seems to you, you must test it. When it is persistently pressing you to do something and you can hardly conceive how this thing could be possible, you have a position in the power of the Word of God to say to this evil power, "Did Jesus come in the flesh?" (1 John 4:3). And the satanic power will say no. But the Spirit of the living God, the Holy Spirit, always says yes. And so you can get to know the difference. We have to live in the place of knowing the Scriptures and listening to His voice so that we are able to divinely discern whether these things are of God or not.\n\nDid Jesus come in the flesh? Yes, and now the living Christ is within you. Christ came into you the moment you believed. There is a manifestation of it. You may live in such a way that your language, your expressions, your actions, and everything speak of Christ. “They realized that they had been with Jesus”  (Acts 4:13). You can live in such a way that the personality of Christ is exactly what Paul said: "Not I—I don‘t live anymore. Christ lives in me." (See Galatians 2:20.)\n\nThe Christ life, the Christ power, the personality of His presence may be in you in such a way that you cannot doubt the Word of God.',
