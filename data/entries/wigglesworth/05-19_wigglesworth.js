    "body": 'esus has prepared a beautiful place for us, and we will have no fear of anyone else taking it; it is reserved. When I went to J certain meetings, I would have a reserved seat. I could walk in at any time, and my seat would be unoccupied. What is good about having a reservation? You have a place where you can see Him; it is the very seat you would have chosen. He knows just what you want! He has designed the place for you. Because of His love, you will have joy instead of discord throughout eternity. Will you be there? Is it possible to miss it? We “are kept by the power of God through faith for salvation ready to be revealed in the last time”  (1 Pet. 1:5).\n\nWhat is distinctive about it? It will be the fullness of perfection, the ideal of love. The poor in spirit, the mourners, the meek, the hungry and thirsty, the merciful, the pure—all will be ready to be revealed at the appearing of Jesus Christ. You could not remain there unless you had experienced His purifying, perfecting, and establishing. You will be ready when His perfect will has been worked out in you. When you are refined enough, you will go.\n\nBut there is something to be done yet to establish you, to make you purer. A great price has been paid: “The genuineness of your faith…[is]  much more precious than gold that perishes”  (v. 7). And we must give all and yield all as our Great Refiner puts us in the melting pot again and again. He does this so that we will lose the chaff (Matt. 3:12), so that the pure gold of His presence will be clearly seen, and His glorious image will be reflected.',
