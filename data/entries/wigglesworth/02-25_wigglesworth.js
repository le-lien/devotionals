    "body": 'aul spoke of two classes of Christians, the obedient and the disobedient. The obedient always obey God when He first P speaks. It is these people whom God will use to make the world know Him.\n\nYou cannot talk about things that you have never experienced. God has a process of training us. You cannot take people into the depths of God unless you have been broken yourself. I have been broken and broken and broken. Praise God, for “the LORD is near to those who have a broken heart”  (Ps. 34:18). You must have a brokenness to get into the depths of God.\n\nThere is a rest of faith that rests in confidence in God. God‘s promises never fail. “Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God”  (Rom. 10:17). The Word of God can create an irresisti-ble faith, a faith that is never daunted, a faith that never gives up and never fails. We fail to realize the largeness of our Father‘s supply. We forget that He has a supply that cannot be exhausted. It pleases Him when we ask for much. “If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!”  (Matt. 7:11). It is the “much more”  that God shows me.\n\nThere are times when a stone wall seems to be in front of us. There are times when there are no feelings, when everything seems as black as midnight, and there is nothing left but confidence in God. What you must do is have the devotion and confidence to believe that He will not fail and cannot fail. You will never get anywhere if you depend on your feelings. There is something a thousand times better than feelings, and it is the powerful Word of God. A divine revelation within you came when you were born from above, and this is real faith. To be born into the new kingdom is to be born into a new faith.',
