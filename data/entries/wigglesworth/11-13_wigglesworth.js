    "body": 'ne day I was in a meeting where there were a lot of doctors and eminent men and many ministers. The power of God fell O on this meeting. A humble little girl who served as a waitress opened her heart to the Lord and was immediately filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in tongues. All these big men stretched their necks and looked up to see what was happening. They were saying, "Who is it?" Then they learned it was "the servant." Nobody received except the servant! These things are hidden and kept back from the “wise and prudent”  (Matt. 11:25), but the little children, the humble ones, are the ones who receive. We cannot have faith if we show undue deference to one another. A man who is going on with God won‘t accept honor from his fellow beings. God honors the person who has a broken, contrite spirit. How can I get to that place?\n\nSo many people want to do great things and to be seen doing them, but the one whom God will use is the one who is willing to be told what to do. And you and I will never do anything without compassion. We will never be able to remove the cancer until we are immersed so deeply in the power of the Holy Spirit that the compassion of Christ is moving through us.\n\nI find that in everything my Lord did, He said that He did not do it but that Another who was in Him did the work (John 14:10). What a holy submission! He was just an instrument for the glory of God. Have we reached a place where we dare to be trusted with a gift from God? I see in 1 Corinthians 13 that if I have faith to move mountains and do not have love, all is a failure. When my love is so deepened in God that I only move for the glory of God, then the gifts can be made manifest. God wants to be manifested and to manifest His glory to those who are humble.',
