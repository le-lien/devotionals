    "body": 'have looked through my Bible, and I cannot find where God brings disease and sickness. I know it is the power of God I that brings the glory. Yet it is the Devil and not God at all who brings sickness and disease. Why does he? I know this: Satan is God‘s whip, and if you don‘t obey God, God will stand to one side and Satan will devour you. But God will only allow him to devour so much, as was the case with Job. The Lord told Satan, "You may go only so far, and no further. Don‘t touch his life." (See Job 2:6.) Why is Satan allowed to bring sickness? It is because we know better than we act. If we would be true to our convictions and walk according to the light we have been given, God would verify His presence in the midst of us, and we would know that sickness cannot “come near [our]  dwelling; for He shall give His angels charge over [us],  to keep [us]  in all [our]  ways”  (Ps. 91:10–11).\n\nWhen Satan can get to your body, he will, if possible, make the pain or the weakness so distracting that it will affect your mind and always bring your mind down to where the pain is. When that takes place, you do not have the same freedom in your spirit to lift up your heart and shout and praise the Lord. The distraction of the pain brings the foundational power, which ought to be full of praise to God, down into the body. And through that—concerning everybody who is afflicted— “the kingdom of heaven suffers violence” (Matt. 11:12).',
