    "body": 'e must keep in the spiritual tide—God supreme, the altar within the body. Faith is the evidence, the power, the W principle, keeping us in rest. We must have the Spirit in anointing, intercession, revelation, and great power of ministry. To be baptized in the Holy Spirit is to be in God‘s plan—the Spirit preeminent, revealing the Christ of God, making the Word of God alive—something divine. “Our sufficiency is from God, who also made us sufficient as ministers of the…Spirit; for the…Spirit gives life”  (2 Cor. 3:5–6).\n\nI knew a believer whose job was to carry bags of coal. He had been in bed three weeks away from his work. I showed him Romans 7:25: “I thank God; through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.”  I said, "Keep your mind on God and go to work, shouting victory." He did, and the first day he was able to carry a hundred bags, his mind stayed on God and kept in peace. “Great peace have those who love Your law, and nothing causes them to stumble” (Ps. 119:165).\n\nIf your peace is disturbed, there is something wrong. Apply the blood of Jesus, and keep your mind stayed upon Jehovah, where "hearts are fully blessed, finding as He promised, perfect peace and rest." Keep your mind on God, gaining strength in Him day by day.\n\n“The law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ”  (John 1:17). This is a new dispensation, this divine place: Christ in you, the hope and evidence of glory (Col. 1:27).\n\nMay God gird you with truth (Eph. 6:14). I commend you to Him in the name of Jesus.',
