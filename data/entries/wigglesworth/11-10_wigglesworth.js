    "body": 'h, this wonderful faith of the Lord Jesus. Our faith comes to an end. Many times I have been to the place where I have O had to tell the Lord, "I have used all the faith I have," and then He has placed His own faith within me.\n\nOne of my fellow workers in ministry said to me at Christmas-time, "Wigglesworth, I was never so near the end of my finances in my life." I replied, "Thank God, you are just at the opening of God‘s treasures." It is when we possess nothing that we can possess all things. The Lord will always meet you when you are on the edge of living.\n\nI was in Ireland one time, and I went to a house and said to the lady who came to the door, "Is Brother Wallace here?" She replied, "Oh, he has gone to Bangor, but God has sent you here for me. I need you. Come in." She told me her husband was a deacon of the Presbyterian church. She herself had received the baptism of the Spirit while she was a member of the Presbyterian church, but they did not accept it as from God. The people of the church said to her husband, "This thing cannot go on. We don‘t want you to be a deacon any longer, and your wife is not wanted in the church."\n\nThe man was very enraged, and he became incensed against his wife. It seemed as though an evil spirit had possessed him, and the home that had once been peaceful became very terrible. Finally, he left home without leaving behind any money for his wife. The woman asked me what she should do.\n\nWe went to prayer, and before we had prayed five minutes, the woman was mightily filled with the Holy Spirit. I said to her, "Sit down and let me talk to you. Are you often in the Spirit like this?" She said, "Yes, and what could I do without the Holy Spirit now?" I said to her, "The situation is yours. The Word of God says that you have power to sanctify your husband. (See 1 Corinthians 7:14). Dare to believe the Word of God. Now the first thing we must do is to pray that your husband comes back tonight." She said, "I know 474\n\nhe won‘t." I replied, "If we agree together, it is done." She said, "I will agree." Then I said to her, "When he comes home, show him all possible love; lavish everything upon him. If he won‘t hear what you have to say, let him go to bed. The situation is yours. Get down before God and claim him for the Lord. Get into the glory just as you have gotten into it today, and as the Spirit of God prays through you, you will find that God will grant all the desires of your heart."\n\nA month later I saw this sister at a conference. She told how her husband came home that night. He went to bed, but she prayed right through to victory and then put her hands on him and prayed. He cried out for mercy. The Lord saved him and baptized him in the Holy Spirit. The power of God is beyond all our conception. The trouble is that we do not have the power of God in a full manifestation because of our finite thoughts. But you will never get anywhere unless you are in constant pursuit of all the power of God.',
