    "body": 'am going to give you a very important word about the usefulness of praying in the Spirit. Lots of people are still withI out an understanding of what it is to pray in the Spirit. I am going to tell you a story that will help you to see how necessary it is that you be so lost in the order of the Holy Spirit that you will pray in the Holy Spirit.\n\nOur missionary work in the center of Africa was opened by Brothers Burton and Salter, the latter being my daughter‘s husband. When they went there, there were four of them: Brothers Burton and Salter, an old man who wanted to go to help them build, and a young man who believed he was called to go. The old man died on the road and the young man turned back, so there were only two left.\n\nThey worked and labored. God was with them in a wonderful way. But Burton took sick, and all hopes were gone. Fevers are dreadful there; mosquitoes swarm; great evils are there. There he was, laid out; there was no hope. They covered him over and went outside very sorrowfully, because he truly was a pioneer missionary. They were in great distress and uttered words like this: "He has preached his last sermon."\n\nWhen they were in that state, without any prompting whatever, Brother Burton stood right in the midst of them. He had arisen from his bed and had walked outside, and he now stood in the midst of them. They were astonished and asked how and what had happened.\n\nAll he could say was that he had been awakened out of a deep sleep with a warm thrill that went over his head, right down his body, and out through his toes.\n\n"I feel so well," he said. "I don‘t know anything about my sickness."\n\nIt remained a mystery. Later, when he was over in England visiting, a lady said to him, "Brother Burton, do you keep a diary?"\n\n"Yes," he said.\n\n"Don‘t open the diary," she said, "until I talk with you."\n\n"All right."\n\nThis is the story she told.\n\n"At a certain time on a certain day, the Spirit of the Lord moved upon me. I was so moved by the power of the Spirit that I went alone into a place to pray. As I went there, believing that, just as usual, I was going to open my mouth and pray, the Spirit laid hold of me and I was praying in the Spirit—not with understanding, but praying in the Spirit.\n\n"As I prayed, I saw right into Africa; I saw you laid out helpless and, to all appearances, apparently dead. I prayed on until the Spirit lifted me, I knew I was in victory, and I saw you had risen up from that bed.\n\n"Look at your diary, will you?"\n\nHe looked in the diary and found that it was exactly the same day.\n\nSo there are revivals to come; there are wonderful things to be done, when we can be lost in the Spirit until the Spirit prays through to victory.',
