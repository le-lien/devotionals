He will bring us to so rich a place that forever we will know we are only the Lord‘s. What a blessed state of grace to be brought into, where we know that the body, the soul, and the spirit are preserved blameless until the coming of the Lord (1 Thess. 5:23)!\n\nGod is greatly desirous for us to have more of His presence. We have only one purpose in mind: to strengthen you, to build you up in the most holy faith, and to present you for every good work so that you should be faultless in Him, quickened by the might of the Spirit, so that you might be prepared for everything that God has for you in the future. Our human nature may be brought to a place where it is so superabundantly attended to by God that in the body we will know nothing but the Lord of Hosts.\n\nTo this end, I invite you to the banquet that cannot be exhausted, a supply beyond all human thought, an abundance beyond all human extravagances.\n\nAre you ready to be brought by the power of God into His new plan of righteousness? Are you ready to be able as never before to leave the things of the world behind and press on toward the prize of the high calling (Phil. 3:13–14)?\n\nAre you ready to be so in God‘s plan that you will feel God‘s hand upon you? You will know that He has chosen you, so that you might be a firstfruit unto God.\n\nAre you ready for the Lord to have His choice, so that His will and purpose will be yours, so that the "Amen" of His character may sweep through your very nature, and so that you may know as you have never known before that this is the day of the visitation between you and Him?',
