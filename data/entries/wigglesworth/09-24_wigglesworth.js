    "body": 'The power of God can so dwell in us that it can burn up everything that is not spiritual and dissolve it to the perfection T of beauty and holiness that Jesus has. Jesus was perfectly dissolved in regard to everything in His human nature, and He lived in the Spirit over everything else. As He is, so we have to be. (See 1 John 4:17.)\n\nWe shouldn‘t be troubled in the flesh. Was Jesus troubled in the flesh? Didn‘t He go forth with perfect victory? It is impossible for any avenue of flesh, or anything that you touch in your natural body, to be helpful. Even your eyes have to be sanctified by the power of God so that they strike fire every time you look at a sinner, and the sinner will be changed.\n\nWe will be clothed with a robe of righteousness in God so that wherever we walk, there will be a whiteness of effectiveness that will bring people to a place of conviction of sin. You say, "There are so many things in my house that would have to be thrown out the window if Jesus came to my home." I pray that we could understand that He is already in the house all the time. Everything ought to go out the window that couldn‘t stand His eyes on it. Every impression of our hearts that would bring trouble if He looked at us ought to go forever.\n\nYou ask, "What are we to do?" We are to be “swallowed up by life” (2 Cor. 5:4). The great I AM in perfect holiness isn‘t just an example, but He clothes us with His own nature.\n\nIt is impossible for us to subdue kingdoms (see Hebrews 11:33), impossible for the greater works to be accomplished (see John 14:12), impossible for the Son of God to be making sons on earth except as we stand exactly in His place.',
