He doesn’t need to hear it as much as you need to say it. Whether it’s too small to be mentioned or too big to be forgiven isn’t yours to decide. Your task is to be honest… .\nAre there any unsurrendered worries in my heart?\n“Give all your worries to him, because he cares about you” (1 Pet. 5:7).\nThe German word for worry  means “to strangle.” The Greek word means\n“to divide the mind.” Both are accurate. Worry is a noose on the neck and a distraction of the mind, neither of which is befitting for joy. ',
