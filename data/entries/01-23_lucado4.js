Not because of how good you are, but because you believe God’s promises to take His children home to heaven. And you’ll enjoy your special place forever, not just for a day.\nYou’ll take your seat next to all the other sinners who’ve obeyed God and been washed clean of their sins—people like Moses and David and Ruth.\nAnd you will all share in God’s glory and His blessings.
