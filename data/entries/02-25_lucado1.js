Come and see.\nCome and see the changed lives:\nthe alcoholic now dry,\nthe embittered now joyful,\nthe shamed now forgiven …\nmarriages rebuilt, the orphans embraced,\nthe imprisoned inspired… .\nCome and see the pierced hand of God touch the most common heart, wipe the tear from the wrinkled face, and forgive the ugliest sin.\nCome and see. He avoids no seeker. He ignores no probe. He fears no search. Come and see. ',
