    "body": 'od‘s Word is “from everlasting to everlasting”  (Ps. 90:2). His Word cannot fail. God‘s Word is true, and when we rest in its G truth, what mighty results we can get. Faith never looks in the mirror. The mirror of faith is the perfect law of liberty.\n\nTo the man who looks into this perfect law of God, all darkness is removed. He sees his completeness in Christ. There is no darkness in faith. Darkness is only in nature. Darkness exists when the natural replaces the divine.\n\nGrace and peace are multiplied to us through a knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ. As we really know our God and Savior, we will have peace multiplied to us like the multiplied fires of ten thousand Nebuchadnezzars. Our faith will increase even though we are put into a den of lions, and we will live with joy in the middle of the whole thing.\n\nWhat was the difference between Daniel and the king that night when Daniel was put into the den of lions? Daniel‘s faith was certain, but the king‘s was experimental. The king came around the next morning and cried, “Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to deliver you from the lions?”  (Dan. 6:20). Daniel answered, “My God sent His angel and shut the lions‟ mouths”  (v. 22). The thing was done. It was done when Daniel prayed with his windows open toward heaven. Prayer links us to our lovely God, our abounding God, our multiplying God. Oh, I love Him. He is so wonderful!',
