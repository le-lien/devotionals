How long since you gave Him a part of your day—without any computers or television or telephones? How long since you just listened for His voice and did nothing else? That’s what Jesus did. He set aside time to spend time with God—just God.\nIf you read about the life of Jesus in the Bible, you’ll see that He made time with God a habit. He spent time with God regularly, praying and listening. Mark said, “Early the next morning, Jesus woke and left the house while it was still dark. He went to a place to be alone and pray” (Mark 1:35).\nLet me ask you a question. If Jesus—the Son of God, the Savior who never sinned—thought He needed to take time to pray, wouldn’t we be smart to do the same? ',
