    "body": 'Biographies of bold disciples begin with chapters of honest terror.\nFear of death. Fear of failure. Fear of loneliness. Fear of a wasted life. Fear of failing to know God.\nFaith begins when you see God on the mountain and you are in the valley and you know that you’re too weak to make the climb. You see what you need . . . you see what you have . . . and what you have isn’t enough to accomplish anything… .\nMoses had a sea in front and an enemy behind. The Israelites could swim or they could fight. But neither option was enough… .\nPaul had mastered the Law. He had mastered the system. But one glimpse of God convinced him that sacrifice and symbols were not enough.\n…\nFaith that begins with fear will end up nearer the Father. ',
