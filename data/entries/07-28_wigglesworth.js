    "body": 'od can so change us by His Word day by day that we are altogether different. David knew this. He said, “Your word has G given me life”  (Ps. 119:50). “He sent His word and healed them”  (Ps. 107:20). How beautiful that God can make His Word abound! “Your word I have hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against You!”  (Ps. 119:11).\n\nIt is absolute disloyalty and unbelief to pray about anything in the Word of God. Believe and receive the Word of God, and you will always be on sure ground. If you pray about the Word of God, the Devil will be behind the whole thing. Never pray about anything concerning which it can be said, "Thus says the Lord." You need to receive God‘s words so that they will build you on a new foundation of truth.\n\nIn Romans 12:1, we see that Paul had been operated on: I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.\n\nHe had undergone a mighty operation on more than just a surgical table. He had been cut to the very depths of his being, until he had absolutely reached a place on the altar of full surrender. When he came to this place, out of the depths of this experience, he gave his whole life, as it were, in a nutshell.',
