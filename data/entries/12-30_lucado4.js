No, not the color of your eyes, or the shape of your nose, or whether or not you have dimples.\nGod wants to add His glory to your face—just like He did for Moses. When Moses came down the mountain with the Ten Commandments, his face “was shining because he had talked with the Lord” (Exodus 34:29).\nLet me be very clear. This change is <i>God’s</i>  job, not <i>yours</i>. Your job is not to stick some fake, frozen smile on your face. Your job is simply to stand before God with a prepared and willing heart and then let God change your face.\nAnd He does. He wipes away the tears. He mops away the sweat. He softens your worried brow. He touches your cheeks. He changes your face as you worship Him. God makes you shine.',

There are even guides for reading through the whole Bible in a year. Or read a proverb or a psalm each day. January 1 is a great time to start!'
