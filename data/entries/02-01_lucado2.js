The bronzed Galilean who spoke with such thunderous authority and loved with such childlike humility.\nThe one who claimed to be older than time and greater than death… .\nHave you seen him?\nThose who first did were never the same.\n“My Lord and my God!” cried Thomas.\n“I have seen the Lord,” exclaimed Mary Magdalene.\n“We have seen his glory,” declared John.\n“Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked?” rejoiced the two Emmausbound disciples.\nBut Peter said it best. “We were eyewitnesses of his majesty.” ',
