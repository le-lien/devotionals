Just Christians. No denominations. No hierarchies. No traditions. Just Christ.\nToo idealistic? Impossible to achieve? I don’t think so. Harder things have been done, you know. For example, once upon a tree, a Creator gave his life for his creation. Maybe all we need are a few hearts that are willing to follow suit.\nWhat about you? Can you build a bridge? Toss a rope? Span a chasm?\nPray for oneness? ',
