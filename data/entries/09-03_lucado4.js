Jesus was busy. Paul was busy. Peter was busy.\nNothing important happens without hard work and tiredness. No, being busy is not a sin.\nBut what are we being busy about? Is it an endless chase to get more stuff—the newest, the greatest, the latest? Or an endless search for popularity—be the best, look the best? That kind of busyness will only leave you empty inside. That isn’t pleasing to God. ',

Your stuff, your pride, your popularity—these are just things. When you try to make a life out of things instead of God, you only make yourself tired and unhappy.',
