When the moment comes to board the plane, I stand between the attendant and the child. As each daughter passes, I place a ticket in her hand.\nShe, in turn, gives the ticket to the attendant. Each one receives the ticket in the nick of time.\nWhat I do for my daughters, God does for you. He places himself between you and the need. And at the right time, he gives you the ticket.\nWasn’t this the promise he gave his disciples? “When you are arrested and judged, don’t worry ahead of time about what you should say. Say whatever is given you to say at that time, because it will not really be you speaking; it will be the Holy Spirit” (Mark 13:11 NCV).\nGod leads us. He will do the right thing at the right time.\nONE MORE THOUGHT ',
