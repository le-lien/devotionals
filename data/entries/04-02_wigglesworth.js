    "body": 'ake note of this: there is an elect of God. I know that God has people who are the elect of God, and if you would ex-T amine yourself, you would be amazed to find that you are one of them. People are tremendously afraid of this position because they have so often heard, "Oh, you know you are the elect of God! You are sure to be all right." There have been great churches in England that were founded upon these things. I thank God that they have all withered. If you go to England, you will find that those strong people who used to hold all these things are almost withered out. Why? Because they went on to say that, if you were elect, you were right in whatever you did. That is wrong.\n\nThe elect of God are those who are pressing forward. The elect of God cannot hold still: they are always on the wing. Every person who has a knowledge of the elect of God realizes it is important that he press forward. He cannot endure sin or shady things. The elect are so in earnest to be elect for God that they burn every bridge behind them.\n\nKnow that first there will be a falling away (2 Thess. 2:3). God will bring into His treasury the realities of the truth and put them side by side: the false, the true; those that can be shaken, and those that cannot be shaken.',
