    "body": 'He who “lives forever” has placed himself at the head of a band of pilgrims who mutter, “How long, O Lord? How long?” (Psalm 89:46 NIV).\n“How long must I endure this sickness?”\n“How long must I endure this spouse?”\n“How long must I endure this paycheck?”\nDo you really want God to answer? He could, you know. He could answer in terms of the here and now with time increments we know. “Two more years on the illness.” “The rest of your life in the marriage.” “Ten more years for the bills.”\nBut he seldom does that. He usually opts to measure the here and now against the there and then. And when you compare this  life to that  life, this life ain’t long. ',
