    "body": 'You are driving to work when the words of your coworker come to mind.\nHe needled you about your performance. He second-guessed your efficiency. Why was he so hard on you? You begin to wonder. I didn’t deserve any of that. Who is he to criticize me? Besides, he has as much taste as a rice cake. Have you seen those shoes he wears?\nAt this point you need to make a choice. Am I going to keep a list of these wrongs?  You can… .\nOr you can do something else. You can take those thoughts captive. You can defy the culprit. Quote a verse if you have to: “Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse” (Rom. 12:14 NIV)… .\nYou are not a victim of your thoughts. You have a vote. You have a voice. ',
