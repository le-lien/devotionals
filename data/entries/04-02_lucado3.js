But when those relationships turn sour, everything seems wrong. It hurts when friends don’t get along.\nJesus understands the challenge. He came to build relationships with people. He came to take away the hostile feelings, conflict, and isolation that existed between God and man. Once he overcame that, he said, “I have called you friends” (John 15:15).\nIn repairing a relationship, it’s essential to realize that no friendship is perfect and no person is perfect. If you decide that you’re going to make a relationship work, you can develop peace treaties of love and acceptance and harmony to change a difficult situation into something beautiful. Jesus was misunderstood and rejected, yet he patiently persisted at forming relationships with his followers. Can’t you and I do the same? ',
