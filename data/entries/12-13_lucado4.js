While we were there, we met several American families who had come there to adopt children.\nThe families would spend days, sometimes weeks, struggling with a different language and a strange city. There were endless forms to fill out, dozens of people to meet with, and lots of money to be paid—all with the hope of taking a child home to the United States. ',

We have every legal right given to His children. We are just waiting for Him to return. We are, as Paul said, “waiting for God to finish making us his own children” (Romans 8:23).',

When you are adopted by God, He gives you certain rights too. He gives you His name, He takes care of you, and you will inherit His home.'
