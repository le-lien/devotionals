Though you are one of a crowd, it’s as if you and Jesus are all alone.\nI wonder if Jesus might say these words to you: “I’m so proud that you let Me use you. Because of you, others are here today. Would you like to meet them?”\nAnd, one by one, they begin to step forward.\nThe first is that grouchy old lady who lived next door. You didn’t think you would see her in heaven! “You never knew I was watching when you did kind things for everyone in the neighborhood,” she says, “but I was.\nAnd because of you, I am here.”\nIt’s not long before you and Jesus are surrounded by all the souls you’ve touched. Some you know, and some you don’t. But you are so happy for each of them. And how wonderful to hear Jesus say, “I am so proud of your faith” (1 Thessalonians 2:19). ',

Or are you the one who cleans up the mess you didn’t make? The one who picks up the trash from the neighbor’s yard? Who are you when no one is watching?'
