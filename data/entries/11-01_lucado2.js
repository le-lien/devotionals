Left at the altar. Left with an empty bed. Left with a broken heart. Left with your question “Does anybody love me?”\nPlease listen to heaven’s answer. God loves you. Personally. Powerfully.\nPassionately. Others have promised and failed. But God has promised and succeeded. He loves you with an unfailing love. And his love—if you will let it—can fill you and leave you with a love worth giving.\nSo come. Come thirsty and drink deeply. ',
